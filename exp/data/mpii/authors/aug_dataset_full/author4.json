    "6": "In the opening scene, Ricky steps into view, and Lester, appearing naked from the waist up, drapes an arm around him while handing him money. Ricky, his hair damp from the rain, tucks the cash into his pocket, grinning, while Lester keeps his arm around him. Ricky then crouches down to reach under a weight bench. Meanwhile, Lester sits back in his chair, hands behind his head, observing Ricky rolling a joint. The Colonel, watching from his perspective, sees Lester leaned back and can only see Ricky's back, mistakenly appearing as if Ricky is performing a intimate act on Lester. The Colonel's face tenses, then registers shock as Lester's jaw drops and he throws his head back.\n\nThe sound of a car approaching shifts the Colonel's gaze to Angela's BMW pulling up behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane exit the car and rush towards the house, the focus returns to the garage window. Ricky stands up, looking panicked, and Lester hurriedly puts on his T-shirt before they both move out of sight.\n\nInside, Jane and Angela enter, with Jane frowning upon seeing Lester. He leans casually against the counter, successfully maintaining his composure. Jane, unimpressed, rolls her eyes and leaves. Angela approaches Lester, placing her hand on his arm flirtatiously, expecting to intimidate him. However, Lester is unmoved and confidently meets her gaze, leaning in with a slow smile and a low, intense voice. Angela, suddenly insecure, quickly retreats, leaving Lester bewildered.\n\nRicky enters, soaked from the rain, and retrieves the cash from his pocket as he moves towards his bureau. Startled, he turns to see the Colonel emerging from the shadows. The Colonel strikes Ricky forcefully, sending him sprawling. Ricky gets up, realizing he's found a way to free himself from his father's grip, hardly believing it was so straightforward. He grabs his backpack and walks out, leaving the Colonel standing alone, breathless and glassy-eyed.\n\nRicky finds Barbara standing frightened in the middle of the room, holding a dish. Having overheard his argument with his father, she searches his eyes, sensing something significant has occurred. Ricky softly kisses her cheek and exits through the back door, leaving her alone and clutching the dish. The Colonel watches from above as Ricky dashes through the rain to the Burnhams' front door and knocks.",
    "8": "In the thick, silent tension, Angela and Lester stand, the air between them electric and charged. Lester, exuding a magnetic attractiveness, leans in close, his face inches from hers. Angela, unsettled by the rapid unfolding of events, attempts a seductive demeanor but falters awkwardly. She takes a deep breath as Lester moves in, his lips brushing her cheek, forehead, eyelids, and neck before finally meeting her lips.\n\nAngela reclines on the couch, Lester towering over her. He gently removes her jeans, his fingers grazing her legs before caressing her face. Meanwhile, Ricky and Jane lie fully clothed on Jane's bed, Jane detached from the scene unfolding around her. Lester proceeds to unbutton Angela's blouse, revealing her breasts, a grin of disbelief spreading across his face as his long-held fantasy seems to materialize.\n\nSuddenly, Lester laughs, his grin fading as he looks down at Angela, her vulnerability and embarrassment starkly evident. This is not the seductive creature of his dreams, but a nervous, innocent child. His expression shifts to one of realization and concern. Grabbing a blanket, he drapes it around her shoulders, concealing her nakedness. He shakes his head, a soft smile playing on his lips. Angela, humiliated, begins to cry, and Lester pulls her into a comforting embrace, stroking her hair as she weeps.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn drives resolutely through the pouring rain, the red door of the Burnham house a beacon even in the storm. Inside, Angela, now fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter eating a turkey sandwich. Lester watches her, a curious contentment washing over him. His gaze lands on a photograph on the counter, a framed image of him, Carolyn, and Jane from years past, their happiness startlingly evident. He picks it up, studying it intently. A profound understanding seems to settle over him, and he smiles, the satisfied smile of a man finally grasping a long-ago joke.\n\nIn a chilling turn, the barrel of a gun slowly rises behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull, leaving Lester's newfound peace hanging in the balance.",
    "1": "In the quiet of her bedroom, Jane awakens and sits up, her eyes meeting ours. Suddenly, we're airborne, gently descending towards a tranquil, tree-lined suburban street. Our gaze is drawn to a king-sized bed where Lester Burnham lies asleep, face down, amidst luxurious linens, clad in pajamas. The piercing sound of an alarm clock interrupts the silence. Lester fumbles to turn it off, then rolls over with a sigh, his eyes meeting ours briefly before he sits up and slides into his slippers. He steps into a hot shower, his silhouette visible through the frosted glass door, where he finds a private moment of release.\n\nOur focus shifts to a dewy American Beauty rose, which is swiftly snipped off by a gloved hand wielding clippers. Carolyn Burnham, a well-dressed forty-something, tends to her rose bushes, her gardening attire color-coordinated, her tools expensive and abundant. Lester watches her from a downstairs window, hidden behind the drapes. A dog barks incessantly next door, drawing the ire of a conservatively dressed man, Jim #1. A second man, Jim #2, emerges from the house, and Lester observes their interactions, as well as Carolyn's conversation with Jim #1, unnoticed.\n\nInside, Jane Burnham sits at her computer, working. A car horn blares outside, prompting her to gather her things and check her reflection in the mirror, appreciating her profile. She exits the house with her backpack, just as Lester rushes out with his briefcase. As Jane gets into the car, Lester's briefcase bursts open, scattering papers across the driveway. He hurriedly gathers them, smiling sheepishly at Carolyn's contemptuous glance.\n\nCarolyn drives, Jane gazes out the window, and Lester dozes in the back seat. Later, he's at his workstation, surrounded by identical beige cubicles, wearing a headset and conversing in a friendly tone that belies his weary expression. Brad, a well-dressed man in his thirties, approaches unnoticed. Lester ends the call, visibly irritated, then turns to Brad with a forced smile. They sit across from each other in Brad's large corner office, Lester appearing small and isolated.",
    "10": "In the opening scene, Brad is poised to escort Lester out, but Lester gazes at him, helpless. Meanwhile, a moving van is stationed in front of the colonial house next to the Burnhams', and a Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway, driven by Carolyn with Lester in the passenger seat. As they exit the car, Carolyn's attention is drawn to the movers next door carrying furniture into the house. She then leads the way inside, with Lester trailing behind.\n\nLater, Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are seated around a candlelit dinner table adorned with a vase of red roses. Suddenly, Lester turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind, all while Carolyn watches intently. She eventually leaves the table and heads to the kitchen, with Lester noticing her critical gaze before she goes. Lester sits quietly, staring at his plate, before finally getting up and following Jane, taking his plate with him.\n\nJane is at the sink, rinsing her plate, when Lester enters. She turns to stare at him, waiting, but offers no help as he struggles with an awkward attempt at intimacy. Through the greenhouse windows, Lester and Jane are visible in the kitchen, their tense exchange apparent despite the inaudible conversation. Jane places her plate in the dishwasher and exits, with the camera following her out before jerking back to Lester calling after her.\n\nFrom Lester's point of view, captured on video, he is seen at the sink, rinsing his plate and muttering to himself. The camera then reveals Ricky Fitts, an eighteen-year-old with eyes that hold a wisdom beyond his years and a hint of something wounded beneath his Zen-like calm. Lester turns off the faucet and dries his hands, tossing the towel onto the counter near a framed photograph of a younger, happier Burnham family at an amusement park. He pauses, looking out the window where Ricky had been standing, sensing that he is being watched.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn is deep in concentration, cleaning with a relentless determination that has her scrubbing countertops, dusting a cheap ceiling fan, and vacuuming a hopelessly dirty carpet. All the while, she repeatedly mutters to herself, pausing only to neatly arrange her sales materials on a desk before stripping down to her undergarments. Finally, she stands before the mirror, once again dressed in her suit, meticulously applying lipstick.",
    "11": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film opens with a woman scrutinizing her reflection, a hint of displeasure in her eyes. She mutters a phrase like a veiled threat and, noticing a blemish on the mirror, wipes it away. Suddenly, the front door swings open, revealing Carolyn, her face lit up with a charming, persuasive smile. She ushers a couple, both around thirty and visibly weary from a day of house hunting, into the living room. Their expressions soured by the dim lighting, they scan the room with thinly veiled disinterest, the woman's face creasing with skepticism.\n\nCarolyn continues her parade of potential homebuyers: a couple in their fifties, an African American couple in their late twenties with a pregnant woman, and two women in their forties standing by a pool. In between showings, she pauses by the sliding glass door, her body still as the blinds cast dramatic shadows across her face. Tears escape her in short, involuntary bursts. She strikes herself, once, then again, and repeatedly, until the tears dry up, her breath steadies, and her calm exterior returns. With a practiced hand, she tugs the blinds shut and strides away, leaving the room dark and vacant.\n\nThe scene shifts to a lively high school basketball game, where teenage boys clash on the court. A team in pale blue and white scores, sending cheerleaders leaping into the air and the crowd into a frenzy. Among the spectators, nestled near the school band, are twenty or so uniformed teenage girls. Jane, sitting next to Angela Hayes, stands out. Angela, a striking blonde 16-year-old with a flawless complexion, embodies the classic American dream girl.\n\nLater, Carolyn drives, with Lester slouched silently in the passenger seat, his demeanor leaving her uncertain on how to respond. They find seats in the crowded gymnasium stands, watching as the uniformed girls perform a well-rehearsed, albeit overly ambitious, Vegas-style routine. Lester's gaze zeroes in on Jane, who performs with concentration, while Angela dances awkwardly beside her.\n\nSuddenly, Angela turns and smiles at Lester - a slow, insolent smile that freezes time. The music warps, echoing eerily as the camera zooms in on Lester's captivated face. The spotlight on Angela intensifies, washing out her teammates. Lester, now alone in the stands, is spellbound as Angela dances seductively, her movements laced with innocence and knowing, her uniform zipper inching downward, teasing the viewers.",
    "15": "In the gripping sequence, Lester appears on the verge of an emotional outburst, his face a picture of barely contained frustration. Meanwhile, Jane resorts to singing loudly to block out the noise, her voice filling the air before abruptly stopping. Lester, driven by panic, hurriedly retreats down the hallway. The scene shifts to Angela, who moves to the window, her figure clad only in underwear as she gazes down. The perspective changes, placing the viewer outside Jane's window, looking in. The camera zooms past Angela, disregarding her pose, and settles on a small makeup mirror reflecting Jane, who is back at her computer, a smile playing on her lips. Suddenly, the drapes close, concealing her from view.\n\nRicky sits in the dark, his digicam recording the scene. He lowers the camera, a satisfied smile on his face, but his attention is soon drawn to something below. Through a window on the side of the Burnhams' garage door, Lester is seen in his suit, frantically rummaging through shelves as if his life depended on it. The sound of someone trying to open a locked door interrupts the silence. Ricky swiftly pulls the drapes shut and turns on a light, revealing a room filled with high-tech equipment—a state-of-the-art multimedia computer, high-end stereo and video gear, and hundreds of CDs, collectively worth tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nRicky opens the door to find the Colonel standing outside, holding out a small plastic cup with a cap. The Colonel hands it over and disappears down the hall. Ricky shuts and locks the door, places the cup on a shelf, and retrieves a cup-sized Tupperware container filled with frozen urine from a mini refrigerator, setting it out to thaw overnight.\n\nLater, Carolyn lies asleep while Lester stares at the ceiling, his mind clearly racing. He carefully gets out of bed, taking pains not to disturb her, and heads toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam, and Lester's confusion turns to focus as he spots Angela in a pedestal bathtub, her naked body obscured by floating rose petals. Lester kneels by the tub, his demeanor reverent. Angela arches her back provocatively, her eyes widening as Lester slips his hand into the water between her legs. She throws her head back in response.\n\nBack in the bedroom, Carolyn lies awake, her eyes wide with realization as she listens to the rhythmic sound of Lester masturbating under the covers. Repelled, she flips over to face him before getting out of bed.",
    "17": "Carolyn, deep in thought, sits alone at a table with two menus. Suddenly, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her, and Carolyn's demeanor instantly shifts, becoming warm and gracious. She is genuinely touched that he remembers her name, her face lighting up with a smile. She picks up her menu absentmindedly, her gaze fixed on him, completely captivated by his presence.\n\nMeanwhile, Ricky stands nearby, his Digicam focused on a decomposing dead bird on the ground. As he jerks the camera up, Jane and Angela are revealed, staring directly at the lens. Angela tries to suppress a laugh and stumbles out of the frame as the camera zooms in on Jane. Ricky lowers his Digicam, smiling at Jane, while Angela stops and turns to look at her.\n\nLater, Carolyn and Buddy are entangled in a passionate encounter. Simultaneously, Lester is cruising through the streets in his Toyota Camry, smoking a joint. He turns down the stereo volume as he pulls up to a fast-food window, where a teenage girl in a headset awaits. After paying and receiving his food, Lester notices a sign in the window. He then sits down with the manager, a young man in a greasy white shirt and tie adorned with the Mr. Smiley's logo, who reviews Lester's application with a puzzled expression.\n\nBack in the bedroom, Carolyn and Buddy laugh softly, post-intimacy. Eager to learn from Buddy, Carolyn sits up, ready to absorb his wisdom. Picking up on his cue, she leans in for another kiss, eager for more.\n\nElsewhere, Ricky and Jane walk together in silence, Ricky seemingly at ease while Jane feels awkward. A funeral procession slowly passes them by, commanding their attention.\n\nIn the sterile, gun-lined Fitts household, Barbara sits at the kitchen table, her gaze distant. Ricky enters with Jane, and Barbara turns to him slowly, her eyes fluttering. Jane takes in the immaculate room and the glass cases filled with guns. Ricky crosses to a cabinet, revealing shelves of war memorabilia. He carefully removes a china platter bearing a small swastika, which he shows to Jane before returning it to the cabinet, noticing her peculiar gaze.\n\nIn a stark contrast, an empty plastic bag floats across a deserted parking lot on a cold, overcast day.",
    "18": "In a swift moment, she turns towards the hallway, her sweet demeanor instantly replaced by a look of repulsion. She swiftly retreats back into her apartment, closing the door behind her. Meanwhile, Melvin, with all his focus and strength, is attempting to coax a small dog into the elevator he’s holding open. The dog, ignoring him, sniffs at a spot on the hallway carpet. Melvin lets the elevator door close and approaches the dog, who lifts his leg just as Melvin lunges, picking the dog up and causing a brief spray of urine on the hallway wall.\n\nSensing a kindred spirit, the dog begins to growl and bark. It tries to snap at Melvin, but he is quicker and meaner, holding the dog's snout shut and reaching for the door of the garbage chute. Without hesitation, he stuffs the dog into the chute and lets go.\n\nSuddenly, another apartment door opens, revealing the sounds of a lively party and Simon Nye, a man in his early 30s. Simon bolts into the hall just as Melvin is about to enter his apartment. Spotting Melvin at the far end of the hallway, Simon watches as Melvin walks back towards his own door, directly opposite Simon's. Melvin notices his black friend and then the handyman, who is trying to suppress a smile.\n\nMelvin barely reacts to the loud knocking he hears. He bursts from his chair as Simon, hearing Melvin through the door, takes a step back. Melvin throws open the door, looking demonic. He walks back into the apartment and is about to close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery. Melvin slams the door shut.\n\nFrank smiles affectionately, but Simon turns serious. Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him forward. Melvin looks scared but also impressed.\n\nMelvin then finds himself on a crowded and dirty street, walking briskly like an animal trying to pass through danger without showing fear. He occasionally places his palms together and extends his arms to cut a path through the crowd, careful to avoid stepping on cracks, his eyes focused on the terrain.\n\nElsewhere, Carol Connelly chats with another mother, a customer, recounting a story about her son for what seems like the umpteenth time. The mother nods sympathetically, but Carol interrupts her. They turn away as Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where Lisa and Carol are talking.",
    "22": "In a bustling diner, four burly Transit Authority Police officers sit in a corner booth, enjoying a meal together. Cheryl's gaze shifts to her utensils, drawing attention to Melvin. The Manager steps in, reassuringly gesturing that he has the situation under control. All eyes are now on Melvin, who assesses the dire scenario and reluctantly rises. As he exits, he glimpses snippets of community life through the window— men gathering outside a bar, parents treating their child to a ride on a mechanical horse, and two young women engrossed in a conversation about dating.\n\nJust as Melvin reaches Carol's doorstep, she opens the door, holding a container filled with ice, washcloths, and a thermometer. Melvin sidesteps her question, addressing instead an accusation he anticipates she might make. Staring blankly, Carol shuts the door on him and leads her son, Spencer, back to his room. They sit together on the edge of Spencer's bed, a digital thermometer pressed to his ear, counting down the seconds.\n\nMeanwhile, as Carol drives off to the hospital, Verdell, Melvin's dog, lies whimpering by the front door. Inside, Jackie sits across from Simon, who is in a wheelchair. Occasionally, she shuffles and consults index cards in her lap. Simon focuses his attention on Jackie, their conversation continuing despite Verdell's growing distress. The dog steps out onto the terrace, looking around anxiously before hiding behind a chair. Jackie glances at Simon, flipping through her cards, visibly frustrated as she nods, waves, and exits.\n\nBack at the hospital, a weary and exhausted Carol approaches her home, suddenly on high alert. She breaks into a run, rushing up the stairs to her apartment. As she fumbles with her keys, a strange, foreboding whimper escapes her. Entering the apartment, her worst fears are confirmed as she inches down the narrow hallway, adrenaline coursing through her veins.\n\nBeverly, Carol's mother, enters the room, her naturally buoyant spirit adding a touch of grace to the grim situation. As Carol and the doctor sit across from each other at a small table, Carol shares a laugh with her mother, who struggles to contain her laughter.\n\nElsewhere, Simon diligently practices walking with his cane. Nora, tear-streaked, bids him an emotional goodbye. Clutching her belongings, she knocks on Melvin's door. As he opens it, she stands there, still sniffling.",
    "23": "In a series of swift movements, he abruptly closes the door on her, leaving her standing there, momentarily stunned by his abruptness. She lingers briefly outside Simon's door before continuing on her way. With the doctor gone, a heated argument ensues between mother and daughter. Simon, confined to his wheelchair, grunts in a mix of pain, hope, and anxiety as he responds. He then wheels himself away from Melvin, who pauses, taken aback by Simon's sudden weeping. Simon's emotional outburst escalates as he swings his arm and cast at Melvin, jolting him but not as much as what follows. Melvin makes a dash for the door, only to be blocked by Simon. Verdell watches Simon with growing concern, while Melvin squirms in discomfort as Simon struggles to regain his composure.\n\nSimon's mood shifts abruptly, and he looks up, now captivated. Carol, meanwhile, is seated on the pullout sofa, her expression one of stoic ruin. She rises and walks to the kitchen, her hands trembling as she drinks a glass of water before exiting. Carol ventures into Manhattan, her face a picture of apprehension, as if she's heading to a final exam she's unprepared for. The hot summer night turns stormy as she steps off the bus, the rain drenching her thin summer dress, which clings to her like a second skin. Consulting a slip of paper with an address, she enters a building, suddenly aware of her revealing attire.\n\nPassing Simon's door, her dress clinging to her like the iconic movie poster of \"The Deep,\" she stands before Melvin's apartment. Twisting in nervousness, she knocks on the door. A muffled throat-clearing sound comes from within, and as the door unlocks, Carol glances down at her dress, gasping. She quickly grasps the fabric, holding it out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is a static mess, standing on end as he periodically pats it down self-consciously. An extraordinarily long silence follows. Melvin struggles internally, fighting not to scream or cry, processing the sudden hurt before answering hoarsely. Carol is both amused and surprised by his reaction.\n\nLater, Melvin rises from his bed, the two digital clocks on his nightstand blinking. He taps one foot on the floor twice, then the other with two more taps, before knocking on Simon's door. It opens quickly, and Simon walks painfully back to a chair. Melvin rises and makes an awkward exit, leaving Simon puzzled and concerned. Meanwhile, Carol sits working on a letter, trying to express her gratitude, a massive stack of completed pages beside her.",
    "33": "Rick takes a seat at the table, engaged in conversation. Meanwhile, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle stroll by, heading toward the cafe entrance. Casselle chatters incessantly while Tonelli attempts to keep up. Suddenly, they halt, salute Renault, and proceed into the cafe. Rick laughs at something just as a plane's buzzing takeoff from the nearby airfield catches his and Renault's attention. The aircraft roars overhead, leaving Rick gazing toward the airport, his expression far from joyful.\n\nThe three men enter the cafe, passing Sam at the piano. Rick gives Sam a friendly pat on the shoulder, his eyes involuntarily drawn toward the gambling room. Renault notices this glance. They ascend to Rick's office, passing Casselle, who is still lecturing Tonelli. Inside the office, Rick opens a small, dark room’s safe. His shadow moves, retrieving money, before he steps into the light and hands the cash to Emil, who then departs. Rick secures the safe and closes the office door. Renault observes Rick's every move.\n\nThey settle down to discuss matters seriously. Rick makes a disapproving face, and Renault rises but pauses as his aide enters. Renault then hurriedly exits, leaving Rick with a cynical smile. Renault approaches Carl briefly before conferring with one of his officers, who salutes and relays orders to the guards. Renault then joins Strasser's table as Rick descends the stairs.\n\nAt the roulette table, Ugarte stands anxiously as two gendarmes approach from behind. An officer nods, and they escort Ugarte to the cashier’s window, where he hands over his chips. The guards burst in, seizing Ugarte, while Rick watches impassively. A tense atmosphere fills the room. Rick steps out to the floor and speaks calmly, glancing at Sam, who begins to play the piano. Renault, Strasser, and Heinze remain composed at their table, having witnessed the arrest. Rick joins them, nodding to Strasser and Heinze, and takes a seat. Major Strasser, a formidable figure in the Third Reich, pulls out a little black book, turning to a specific page.",
    "38": "Annina rushes to Rick and embraces him warmly. Catching sight of Rick, he then turns to find him. Meanwhile, at the bar, Carl leans in to whisper something into Sacha's ear. He approaches Rick, greeting him with a kiss on both cheeks. Carl then pours Rick a glass of brandy. Rick discreetly steals a glance at Ilsa, trying not to be too obvious. Renault approaches Rick, but after a brief interaction, he smiles and departs.\n\nLaszlo then steps up to Rick, and the two men rise to their feet. Laszlo regards Rick with a puzzled expression. Suddenly, both Rick and Laszlo are drawn to the sound of male voices singing downstairs. Rick moves to the balcony outside his office, observing the Germans gathered below. At the bar, Renault watches the scene unfold with a raised eyebrow. Laszlo listens intently to the song, his lips tightly pressed together.\n\nLaszlo begins to descend the steps, while Yvonne, seated with her German officer, stares down at her drink. Addressing the orchestra, Laszlo passes Ilsa's table and proceeds straight to the musicians. The orchestra members look towards the steps, seeking Rick's approval, which he grants with a nod. Laszlo and Corina commence singing as the orchestra plays. Strasser attempts to drown out their voices by leading the Germans in a competing song. Eventually, Strasser and his officers concede and take their seats.\n\nYvonne leaps to her feet, singing along with tears welling up in her eyes. Ilsa, deeply moved, gazes proudly at Laszlo as he sings with fervor. Ultimately, the entire café joins in, their faces radiant with emotion. The song concludes on a high, triumphant note. Yvonne, her face exalted, shouts at the top of her lungs, defiantly facing the alcove where the Germans are seated. Several French officers gather around Laszlo, offering him a drink.\n\nRenault pauses briefly before blowing a loud blast on his whistle. The room falls silent, and all eyes turn towards him. An angry murmur ripples through the crowd as people begin to stand and leave. Rick, taken aback by Renault's audacity, swiftly approaches him. The croupier emerges from the gambling room and hands Renault a roll of bills, his manner abrupt yet cordial.\n\nAs the café empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa, exchanging a meaningful look before bowing and exiting just as Laszlo reaches the table. Ilsa and Laszlo depart the café and make their way to their room. Upon entering, Laszlo flicks on the light while Ilsa removes some of her jewelry. He walks to the window, peering out into the darkness. Below and across the street, a man lingers under an arch. Laszlo observes him briefly before drawing down the shade.\n\nCrossing to a table, Laszlo takes a cigarette from a box and strikes a match to light it. Ilsa, now visibly uncomfortable, moves to the couch and takes a seat. The tension in the room grows palpable as the night wears on.",
    "40": "In the opening moments, Tex scrutinizes a list, carefully folds it, and tucks it into his pocket. Meanwhile, the group finishes sorting items from a bag. A woman hangs up a call and turns her attention to Jean-Louis. Following Jean-Louis’s gaze, Reggie looks up to the top of a tall armoire. She drags a chair over, climbs onto it, and stretches on her tiptoes, managing to blindly grasp and retrieve a rectangular black bag, resembling a trombone case. Just as she pulls it down, Jean-Louis suddenly dashes to the door, unbolts it, and rushes into the hallway, the camera following his urgent movements.\n\nShouting as he runs, Jean-Louis is soon joined by Dyle, who emerges from Gideon’s room, followed quickly by Tex and Gideon from Reggie’s room. The three men hurriedly rush past Jean-Louis and crowd into Scobie’s room. As they enter, Reggie is quietly returning the chair to its original spot. The men stare at the mysterious case, their expressions a mix of surprise and slight embarrassment. Tex slowly lowers the lid, and an awkward silence fills the room as the men avoid each other's gazes, including Reggie and Jean-Louis by the door. Eventually, their eyes meet, and the three men hastily exit, followed by Reggie and Jean-Louis.\n\nThe group crosses the hall to Dyle’s room, where Dyle turns the key still in the door and enters, the others following closely behind. The room is in disarray, looking as if a cyclone had swept through. They quickly realize Scobie is missing, but the sound of running water from the bathroom draws their attention. Dyle notices water leaking from under the bathroom door. Inside, they find Scobie lying face up in a filled tub, his head submerged, the water pouring over the edge, his face grotesquely distorted. Dyle reaches out and turns off the water, the three men staring in horrified shock.\n\nA close-up shot reveals Scobie’s lifeless face, and the camera whirls to capture a tight close-up of a maid, her eyes widening in realization before she lets out a piercing scream. The scene shifts to Grandpierre, who raps on his desk for silence, his stern gaze sweeping over each face in turn.\n\nLater, Reggie and Dyle are seen walking along the quai next to the Seine, having passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double. Their journey continues as they process the unsettling events that have unfolded.",
    "41": "In a nonchalant gesture, Dyle shrugs, prompting her to offer him her ice-cream cone with a forceful thrust that sends the ice-cream tumbling onto his lapel, just above his breast pocket. This scene unfolds with the majestic Cathedral of Notre Dame as the backdrop. The pair, Reggie and Dyle, step out of an elevator and retreat to their individual rooms. Reggie enters hers, fixes her hair in the mirror, and then approaches the connecting door to Dyle's room. She unlocks it but finds it locked from the other side. Disappointed, she knocks. Dyle, hearing her, responds through the closed door while emptying his pockets. As he sits to remove his shoes, Reggie's sudden scream interrupts him. He rushes to the connecting door, unbolts it, and enters her room, only to have the door slammed and locked behind him by Reggie, who pockets the key. Finding the hall door also locked, he turns to see Reggie smiling at him. Resigned, Dyle sits down and begins to remove his shoes.\n\nIn a surprising move, Dyle steps fully clothed into the bath, having first tested the water with his hand. Reggie, astonished, moves closer to the open door to observe him. He rinses his handkerchief, reads a label inside his coat, and playfully flicks water at her before scrubbing his watch and watchband with a nail-brush. Holding up his wrist to show her the watch, he starts to unbutton his suit. Flustered, Reggie turns and leaves, slamming the door behind her.\n\nThe phone rings, and Reggie answers, her expression turning to one of shock and worry as she slowly hangs up. Suddenly, the bathroom door opens, revealing Dyle draped in a large bath towel. She shakes her head in disbelief.\n\nLater, a vibrant motor launch, adorned with lights, cruises along the river. Seated at a intimate table by the rail, the cityscape slowly passing behind them, they return to find a waiter serving food, mostly on Reggie's side. She reacts with surprised happiness but pushes her plate away. Suddenly, the lights go out, and a searchlight from the boat's bridge begins to sweep the riverbanks. Lovers seated on benches by the water's edge are caught off guard, their intimate moments illuminated. Some are embarrassed, others amused, and the most intimate among them, annoyed.",
    "48": "In the quiet of a room, a man meticulously prepares a modest feast from a drawer's contents: an assortment of waxpaper-wrapped sandwiches, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine, and two Dixie cups. Uncorking the wine, he pours himself a cup and begins to eat, then kindly offers a sandwich and a glass of wine to his companion. Not content with the Dixie cup, he retrieves a proper glass from the drawer for her.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to a stark room where four men in army uniform sit behind a table, scrutinizing photographs. A glass magnifies the face of a young Charles Lampert, then moves to reveal another young face. A man, Reggie, nods in recognition and jots down a note, tearing it from his pad to hand it over. Nearby, children roar with excitement as a Punch and Judy show unfolds on stage. The puppets argue and brawl, drawing the attention of Reggie and his companion Peter. Judy triumphs, knocking Punch offstage, and a policeman puppet appears, only to be similarly defeated.\n\nAmidst the commotion, it is revealed that Charles Lampert was entangled in something grim. Reggie and Peter spectate as the violent slapstick continues, Judy besting the policeman puppet. Meanwhile, a man named Grandpierre stands on a dance floor, illuminated by a spotlight. He wears a polished smile, speaking into a microphone as a lively Latin dance band plays.\n\nReggie, elegantly dressed in a Givenchy gown, lashes out at Gideon, kicking him forcefully in the shin. Stiffening in pain, Gideon remains silent, eyes closed, still clutching an orange under his chin. Peter rushes forward, and Reggie steps back, observing Gideon's unexpectedly passive response. Slowly, Gideon opens his eyes, tears streaming down his cheeks. Holding the orange, he speaks softly before turning away, resuming a strange game with a woman nearby.\n\nReggie, now isolated, discovers she forgot to press a button to connect her call. Tex, a rough-edged companion, casually strikes a match, lighting a cigarette. In a sudden, callous act, he tosses the lit match onto Reggie's lap. She frantically extinguishes it, only for Tex to light another and menacingly move it towards her hair. The tension escalates, hinting at an impending confrontation.",
    "53": "In a desperate attempt to hold him back, Dyle grasps the large man by his raincoat lapels. However, Scobie, his face grotesquely contorted with strain, relentlessly inches closer to the gun. Suddenly, Dyle releases his grip. Unrestrained, Scobie lunges forward, stumbling past the gun and onto the sloping roof, where he begins to slide down, frantically clawing at the slate to find a grip. His metal hand screeches against the surface, sending sparks flying, but he slips over the edge and vanishes from sight. Dyle watches, transfixed, as Scobie seems to have disappeared. Yet, a close-up reveals Scobie's metal hand clutching the rain gutter at the very edge.\n\nSeeing the hand, Dyle rises and approaches the roof's edge before turning away and descending the stairs. He exits the elevator and heads to his own door, met by the manager's cold stare. She leads him into her room, where Reggie and Dyle enter from his room. She guides him to the bed and tends to his wounds, cleaning and bandaging them as they converse. Dyle sits on the bed, and she begins to kiss him tenderly, starting from his neck to his mouth. Amidst their intimacy, the phone rings persistently. Reggie eventually answers, mumbling into the receiver with the phone covered, her expression shifting to alarm as Tex speaks on the other end.\n\nMeanwhile, a knock sounds at the door. Gideon opens it to reveal Reggie and Dyle. Inside, Jean-Louis sits on Scobie's knee, and Tex holds a gun. The three men exchange uneasy glances. Gideon takes Dyle's key, handing over his own, and does the same with Reggie. Tex, busy rifling through a bureau, joins Gideon, who empties a bag's contents onto a table. Gideon examines each item, opening a wallet and then reading a letter from an envelope. Tex grins broadly as they continue their inspection of the bag's contents.",
    "54": "In the heart of his office, Jake Gittes breathes life into a shot glass, filling it generously with a modest pour of bourbon from his less prestigious collection. He thrusts the glass towards Curly, who initially blinks at it vacantly before tossing the drink back. Gittes then ushers Curly past Sophie, who deliberately avoids their gaze. With a charismatic smile, Gittes drapes an arm around Curly, but the warmth vanishes as soon as he shuts the door behind them.\n\nEntering another room, Walsh stands in acknowledgment, and Gittes nods in return, striding further in. He approaches Mrs. Mulwray, flashing her a reassuring smile that makes her hold her breath. Pulling up a chair, he sits beside her, nestled between Duffy and Walsh. An irritated glance from Gittes causes Duffy to pause his chewing, eliciting a sigh from Gittes.\n\nThe scene shifts to a council meeting where former Mayor Sam Bagby commands attention, standing before a vast map adorned with overlays and bold text. Despite his engaging presentation, some councilmen remain engrossed in funny papers and gossip columns, while grubby farmers seated nearby appear bored, one even yawning and inching away from his more unkempt neighbor. Meanwhile, an assortment of farmers, businessmen, and city employees listen intently, one even looking up from his racing form. Whispered conferences hum in the background.\n\nBagby, a slim, bespectacled sexagenarian moving with unexpected agility, steps towards the map. He nods to a younger assistant who turns the map's overlay. Mulwray then leaves the map and takes his seat. Suddenly, chaos erupts as a red-faced farmer drives several scrawny, bleating sheep into the chambers. Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms spring into action, attempting to apprehend the disruptive farmers and sheep, with one farmer nearly attacking Mulwray.\n\nUnder the blazing sun, the ugly concrete banks of the river reflect the harsh light. Where the banks are earthen, they lay parched and smothered in weeds. Soon, Mulwray's car appears on a flood control road overlooking the riverbed. Gittes, hidden behind dried mustard weeds, trains his binoculars on Mulwray, who descends to the river's center and pauses, seemingly examining the riverbed or lost in thought. A small Mexican boy, riding a swayback horse, enters the riverbed and Gitte's view. Gittes retreats slightly as Mulwray rounds the bend and encounters the boy on the muddy banks.",
    "59": "In the opening sequence, Mulwray engages in a brief exchange with a young boy, pointing towards the ground with an air of curiosity. The boy responds with a gesture, and Mulwray, captivated, kneels to scrutinize the mud intently. After a moment of careful observation, he thanks the boy, dashes back upstream, and climbs into his car. Retrieving a roll of blueprints from within, he spreads them across the hood and jots down notes, periodically glancing downstream. Once finished, he drives away.\n\nIn the next scene, Mulwray arrives at a new location and parks his car. Gittes, observing from a distance, notices the bay forming a clear, elongated crescent to his right. He hesitates momentarily before scaling a nearby promontory to gain a higher vantage point above Mulwray. Below, Mulwray, seemingly entranced, watches water trickling from an outfall, the flow gradually intensifying into a powerful, foaming cascade.\n\nGittes, now seated in his car, discovers a slip of paper tucked under his windshield wiper. Retrieving it, he illuminates the dash light and opens the glove compartment, revealing a stash of cheap Ingersoll pocket watches. He winds one, checking the time against his own watch—it reads 9:37—before strategically placing it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car.\n\nLater, Walsh presents Gittes with a series of photographs capturing Mulwray dining with a striking companion at a restaurant, a distinctive gnarled cane visible in two of the images. Gittes examines them briefly before tossing them aside in disgust.\n\nThe narrative shifts to Gittes and Duffy in a rowboat, with Gittes seated in the stern. They glide past Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer dress, sharing a tender moment in their own rowboat, oblivious to Gittes's presence. Seizing the opportunity, Gittes swiftly snaps a few photographs. Continuing their surveillance, Gittes and Duffy row past the couple again, allowing Gittes to capture more images.\n\nIn a thrilling climax, the camera pans across a red-tiled roof, descending to a lower level where Gittes lies stretched out, his feet anchored over the roof's apex. With his camera trained on a veranda below, he clandestinely observes the girl and Mulwray enjoying a meal, adding a final layer of intrigue to the unfolding drama.",
    "60": "Jake Gittes, precariously perched on a rooftop, finds himself in sudden danger as the tiles beneath his feet give way. He begins to slip down the tilting roof, inching closer to a perilous three-story drop. The loose tile slides as well, and a fragment from its cracked edge tumbles down. Gittes desperately tries to slow his descent, while below, Mulwray stands transfixed, gazing at the shard at his feet.\n\nMulwray's attention shifts from the fragment to the rooftop, then to a nearby girl. Meanwhile, one of Gittes' photographs, now published, is prominently featured in the newspaper, marked with a heart-shaped drawing reminiscent of the sensational Hearst press style. Gittes can't help but smile in satisfaction.\n\nThe scene shifts to a bustling street where a car is stalled, hood up, as a man watches his radiator boil over. Nearby, Gittes enjoys a haircut and shoe shine while engrossed in the newspaper. Almost every customer in the shop is similarly engrossed. Suddenly, Gittes straightens up, alert. He leaps from his chair, leaving Barney, the barber, trying to restrain him, and rushes out. A customer shrinks back, startled, as Gittes bursts in, slapping a newspaper against his thigh. A woman, seemingly disinterested, gets up and leaves.\n\nIn an office, Walsh and Duffy emerge from their respective spaces as a striking young woman materializes behind Gittes in his doorway. She is soon joined by a small, gray-haired man, both listening unnoticed. Gittes, oblivious to their presence, oscillates between laughter and shock. When he finally looks up, he's taken aback by the young woman's beauty. The gray-haired man winces at Gittes' reaction as the woman, later revealed to be Evelyn, walks past him towards the door.\n\nGittes starts after Evelyn, briefly stopping her, but she flashes a cold smile and continues out the door. He tries to follow, but the gray-haired man intervenes. Gittes stares at the papers in his hand, then turns as he is handed a thick sheaf of papers – a summons and complaint. The secretary tries to protest, but Gittes pushes through into an inner office.\n\nThe walls of this office are adorned with commendations, photos of Mulwray at construction sites, maps of watershed areas, and reservoirs. On the desk sits a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes. Gittes moves to the desk, keeping an eye on the translucent pane in the office door. He begins to methodically search the desk, opening and closing drawers. Reopening the top drawer, he finds that the bottom one opens simultaneously. Inside, he discovers a checkbook. He quickly flips through the check stubs, shuffling them like a deck of cards, examining each one intently.",
    "61": "In a moment of discovery, a character drops an item and finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a Water Department lunch held at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. Jake Gittes notices a shadow looming behind a translucent pane before entering a room, followed closely by an anxious secretary. Gittes nods and follows Yelburton through the outer office to his own, smaller quarters down the hall. Yelburton's office is adorned with a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall, along with pictures of him with various fish, and a small burgee featuring a fish with the initials A.C. tacked onto the wall. Gittes' attention is drawn to a card tray on Yelburton's desk, from which he discreetly pockets a couple of cards.\n\nExiting the office, Gittes nearly collides with Mulvihill, a formidable man dressed in a plain, ill-fitting suit, who stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes. Mulvihill, shaking with fury, advances toward Gittes, but Yelburton intervenes. Gittes then rings a bell, summoning a powerful Chinese butler with distinctive hair and a gold-capped tooth. Handing the butler a card, Gittes waits at the doorway, sweating as he watches a Japanese gardener trim a hedge and a chauffeur wash a cream-colored Packard, steam rising from the hood. The butler eventually gestures for Gittes to follow, leading him through the house where a maid is cleaning, out through French doors, and along a trellised walkway to a large, overflowing pond.\n\nThe gardener returns, smiling at Gittes before probing the pond with a long tool. As the waters recede, the pond overflows, and an eerie quiet settles, interrupted only by the sound of running water. Gittes is left alone, noticing something gleaming at the bottom of the pond. The gardener nods and departs, leaving Gittes to examine the shiny object. Hesitantly, Gittes picks up the gardener's tool and begins probing the pond himself. Suddenly, he spots Evelyn approaching along the trellised pathway. He casually belts the probe, holding it for composure as he awaits her arrival.",
    "62": "Evelyn, dressed in jeans faded white on the inner thighs and adorned with brown horsehair, paired with riding boots, appears more youthful than she did in the office, despite a light sheen of perspiration. Gittes, slightly startled, sees her as a Chinese butler briefly acknowledges them from the veranda before retreating. Evelyn takes a seat at a glass-topped table, and Gittes joins her. Iced tea is served on a tray by Ramon. Evelyn glances up, and Gittes responds with a shy smile and a nervous laugh, nodding slightly.\n\nLater, Gittes navigates a winding road along a flood channel into the dry hills, arriving at a reservoir where a rescue truck is parked. The chain link fence bearing a \"KEEP OUT\" sign is open, with people gathered around. His car is halted by uniformed police, but he presents Yelburton's card and is allowed through. Driving along the reservoir, he stops and exits his vehicle, noticing police cars and men in small boats dredging the water. One man recognizes Gittes, clearly shocked. Loach attempts to guide Gittes away, but a commotion draws the attention of Escobar, who is equally surprised to see Gittes. The surrounding men grow tense.\n\nGittes and Escobar exchange a few words, with Escobar eventually smiling. Police officers watch them intently. Escobar points to the reservoir where men with hooked poles are pulling something from the water—a body in a man's coat. They haul the corpse into the skiff, revealing it to be Mulwray. Escobar lifts and then drops the sheet covering the body. Evelyn, acknowledging the grim discovery, steps aside with Escobar to whisper privately, as if shielding their conversation from the deceased. They slowly move towards the door, Evelyn uncertain of how to respond to Escobar. Meanwhile, Gittes sits on a wooden bench, smoking and listening to the unfolding events.",
    "63": "In response to a question, a man stands up and peers through the doorway, drawing the passive gaze of Escobar, who chooses to ignore him. Evelyn, noticing the figure in the doorway just a couple of feet away, abruptly halts her actions. With Escobar close behind her, they share a prolonged moment of eye contact, during which Gittes remains silent. Evelyn completes her task, casting a pleading look towards Gittes before giving a subtle nod, which is interrupted by Escobar's cough. Gittes lifts the sheet, revealing eyes that stare blankly from a face marred by brutal cuts and bruises. They begin a slow walk, repeatedly stepping aside as other corpses are wheeled past them. Meanwhile, Morty, assisted by a colleague, wheels in another body, pulling back the sheet and casually brushing sand from the deceased’s face, a grim chuckle escaping his lips. As Morty begins to move the body into the refrigerator, a harsh coughing fit seizes him, but he merely shrugs it off.\n\nIn another scene, a boy, riding on horseback, acknowledges the horse's snort with a nod before continuing his slow journey.\nGittes scrambles up an embankment to note the direction of a storm drain near Hollenbeck Bridge, seeing it lead towards the Hollywood Hills where the sun is setting. As darkness falls, Gittes follows the flood channel with his car's spotlight, navigating a dirt road flanked by dense clusters of oak and eucalyptus trees. The road narrows at a fork, revealing a panoramic view of the city lights below, barred by a chain-link fence bolted across the flood channel, forcing Gittes to back up and turn off his car’s lights and engine. Left with only the faint glow from overhead tension wires, Gittes exits the car and batters the fence near the flood channel. Guided by the distant lights from the reservoir above, he cautiously ascends through the thick foliage toward a second, larger chain-link fence.\nDiving into the flood control channel, about four feet deep and six feet wide, Gittes conceals himself among the ivy. Attempting to orient himself, he lifts his head but is suddenly overwhelmed by a torrent of water. The deluge knocks off his hat, carrying him violently down the channel as he desperately grasps for the overgrowth to stop his perilous descent. Despite his efforts, the relentless stream batters him until he is forcefully brought to a halt against the chain-link fence.",
    "67": "In the quiet of a modest room, a dog yawns and shakes off its sleep, while a phone receiver is slammed down forcefully. A rumpled figure, later revealed to be DANTE, stirs slowly, eventually getting up to wrestle playfully with the dog. The dog, meanwhile, quenches its thirst from the toilet bowl, then stands wagging its tail. Dante, now draped in a towel, inspects the inside of his refrigerator, grabbing a half-empty gallon of milk to prepare a breakfast of chocolate milk, which he gulps down hastily.\n\nAs Dante prepares to leave, he grabs keys resting on top of a VCR, exits his house, and gets into his car. He drives to his destination, the tires screeching as he pulls up. Stepping out, he jams the keys into a lock, opening a metal shutter to reveal the entrance of a convenience store. Fluorescent lights flicker on, illuminating the store's interior. A camera captures Dante moving swiftly past a cat, his image barely visible in the dimly lit room.\n\nDante begins his routine, opening bundles of newspapers with scissors and stocking them onto racks. He pauses, noticing one rack remains empty, labeled ASBURY PARK PRESS. Annoyed, he realizes he needs a quarter to retrieve more papers. Opening the register, he extracts the coin and approaches the vending machine. Through the murky glass, his actions are obscured until he opens the door, grabbing a stack of newspapers. Juggling them in one hand, he turns to leave but is halted by the sound of the quarter returning. Dropping the newspapers into the empty rack, he retrieves the quarter and returns it to the register.\n\nLater, Dante struggles with a lock on the window shutter, jammed with something hard like gum. He attempts to force the key in, growing frustrated as he examines the lock and then his surroundings. Finally, in a fit of anger, he kicks the stubborn shutter.",
    "71": "A smoker steps into the convenience store, drawing Dante's attention away from his study of an odd man already present. Dante begins searching for cigarettes while the smoker takes notice of both Randal and the odd man. The odd man performs a peculiar trick, placing a handkerchief over an egg on the floor and swiftly removing it to reveal the egg still intact. Dante, Randal, and the smoker stare at the odd man, captivated by his strange behavior.\n\nMeanwhile, a little girl, no older than five, enters the store with a smile and some money in hand. A female customer silently awaits her turn as Dante rings up her items. Behind the counter, Randal flips open a magazine to its explicit centerfold, causing Dante to hurriedly apologize as the customer swiftly exits. Randal continues to admire the centerfold, oblivious to the commotion.\n\nElsewhere in the store, a woman meticulously searches the cooler for the perfect gallon of milk. A series of people are seen asking trivial questions, both to the camera and throughout the convenience store. Dante, growing irritated with Randal, gives him a shove to quiet him down.\n\nVeronica enters the store, her arms laden with books and a foil-covered item. Dante rushes to her side, relieving her of the books. Randal, making loud slurping noises, walks past them and playfully pats Veronica on the head before exiting, with Veronica following soon after.\n\nRandal is briefly seen recommending movie titles to customers before reappearing to make more loud slurping noises at Dante. He hangs up a phone and joins Dante, only to walk away moments later. Dante, frustrated, shakes his head and picks up the phone again, rolling his eyes in exasperation. Randal returns once more.\n\nPreparations for a hockey game begin, with tape being rolled around the top of a stick, an orange ball hit back and forth, and laces tightly pulled. Randal enters, fully equipped for the game. The convenience store fills with hockey players, one of whom, Sanford, skates in and comes to a halt. Up on the roof, players jump off a ladder and skate around, providing a surreal sight from across the street. Inside, players sit or lean against coolers, all busy preparing or practicing.\n\nDante and another player pass a puck back and forth on the roof while, one by one, players ascend a ladder adjacent to the door. Randal, in his goalie gear, pulls on his mask and slaps his glove, ready for a shot. Sanford skates in and takes his shot, which Randal deftly blocks. Amidst the chaos, Jay and Silent Bob conduct a discreet transaction with a player, exchanging money for a small bag tossed up to the roof.",
    "72": "In the heart of the action, **Dante** commandingly holds a ball mid-court, while off to the side, **Redding** stretches languidly, leaning against a sign. Dante's dynamic energy is evident as he skids to the sidelines, then swiftly skates to his designated area, only to skid back to address a **customer**. Meanwhile, below the court, a **woman** tugs at the door of a store, peering inside with her face pressed against the glass. She steps back, shields her eyes, and gazes up toward the roof.\n\nThe scene intensifies as Dante faces off against the customer. The customer takes a powerful shot, sending the ball soaring off the court and into a distant yard. The ball lands between them, and Dante is abruptly flattened. Undeterred, Dante scrambles to the edge, calling out while visibly hyperventilating. He urgently calls to the sidelines, and **Sanford** promptly skates up to him. After a brief exchange, Dante skates off.\n\nIn a quieter moment, Dante is seen standing on a ladder, carefully replacing a fluorescent light. An **old man** approaches, standing at the foot of the ladder. With the light securely in place, Dante descends and closes the ladder, glancing over with a notable reaction. The old man walks off, only to unexpectedly return, leaving Dante visibly taken aback.\n\nThe narrative shifts as Dante drives with his passenger, **Randal**, the silence between them palpable. Dante glares at Randal as they approach a funeral parlor, where a massive crowd awaits outside the store. Chaos erupts as Dante and Randal run from the front door, chased by a small crowd of angry mourners. The car screams away, leaving the pursuing crowd shaking their fists and throwing objects in the middle of the street.\n\nThe car pulls up again, and Dante and Randal emerge to find the street deserted. Suddenly, **Jay** enters the frame, crudely aiming his butt at Randal and letting out a fart. Dante grabs Randal, who lunges forward, while a kid tugs at Jay's shirt. They head back to the counter, with Dante walking away, shaking his head. He methodically puts up cigarettes as the customer storms off in a huff.\n\nAnother customer leans in, only to be drenched by a mist of water spat by Randal. The man reacts violently, attempting to grab Randal over the counter. Dante steps in to block, and Randal salutes the man as he leaves, wiping water from his face. Randal then exits, leaving Dante to wait on another customer, grunting slightly as he lifts a gallon of milk into a paper bag.\n\nIn the doorway, a female customer, **Heather**, leans in, and a suited man carrying a notebook approaches the counter. He scribbles in his notebook, rips out a piece of paper, and hands it to Dante before exiting, with Dante trying to follow.",
    "76": "**Movie Description**\n\nUnder the low moon, **John** resolutely sets his oar, guiding his small skiff through the turbulent, moonlit water towards the shore. He and his young companions approach the land, eventually reaching the top of the bank. A rustic barn looms in the background, a lighted window hinting at warmth within. A delicate wire bird-cage sways gently near the shade, its silhouette distinct against the light, and within it, a small canary perches quietly.\n\nSoon, unnamed children enter, their backs to the viewer, pausing to observe the scene. The soft glow from the window illuminates their faces as a distant song concludes. A mysterious singer retreats beyond the trees, his voice fading. John wakes a sleeping girl, then disappears himself, leaving only the rustling of children in the hay and the quieting of dogs as his melody ends. Hand in hand, the children hurriedly exit the barn, following its side towards the unseen river.\n\nThe skiff traverses the now-calm water, the children within it lulled to sleep. The vessel narrowly avoids a sand-bar, the prow gently grazing the sand as it tilts upward. Roosters crow in the distance, heralding the morning as John searches for **Pearl**, finding her picking daisies. Beyond the fence, **Rachel Cooper**, bearing a berry basket, appears. Startled, John scrambles, grabbing an oar defensively while Pearl freezes in place.\n\nRachel hesitates briefly before breaking off a switch and pursuing them, her feet sinking in the mud. She herds the children up the bank like geese, their figures moving across the meadow in a picturesque frieze. Rachel occasionally flicks her switch, and as she nears Pearl, John turns protective. Three figures toil beyond a low white fence, picking tomatoes—they are Rachel's girls: **Ruby** (13), **Clary** (11), and little **Mary** (4).\n\nRachel, firmly grasping John and Pearl by their napes, inspects the tomato baskets at the fence gate. Pushing the Harper children through, she walks resolutely between them, her back to the viewer. The children hesitate, causing Rachel to pause and examine them from head to toe. Though her face is unseen, her lips are surely pursed and tense with anger. As John's gaze lowers to her feet, the camera slowly pans up, revealing Rachel's mud-heavy men's shoes, rough skirt, shapeless sweater, and weathered old hat—a woman in her middle sixties, she is our unlikely heroine. Inexplicably, John feels a sense of homecoming.\n\nLater, Rachel vigorously scrubs John clean, despite his protests. He eventually breaks away, dodging behind a bush with Rachel in close pursuit. Meanwhile, Ruby gently washes Pearl with a cloth, the night's adventures drawing to a close.",
    "77": "In the opening scene, Rachel is seen disciplining a child, her head visible above a bush as the distinctive sound of her hand connecting with the child's bottom is heard. She leads a group, all carrying baskets, marching resolutely at the front. They encounter a cattle dealer passing by, but Rachel continues on without pause, the group following her in silence.\n\nA waitress rushes away from the scene, and Rachel deftly avoids a passing car, her eyes tracking the waitress and then a couple in the car. She observes the lovers intensely, sighs with a mixture of anger and resignation directed at all women, including herself, and turns away.\n\nThe setting shifts to the entrance of a grocery store, where the grocer stands on the doorstep. Rachel enters the store with him, approaching the counter with her market basket. She reacts to wolf whistles from off-screen, her expression reflecting a sense of longing and curiosity about the world. Ruby, noticing Rachel, gestures to acknowledge her presence and nods before turning to follow the first loafer who has caught her eye.\n\nIn the background, John enters the scene. Pearl, holding a doll, stands beside him as they often do. John moves quietly to her side, and as he turns, Pearl puts aside a book and picks up her mending, working on it for a few moments. John then crosses behind her and exits towards the door. He returns with two apples, giving one to Pearl. In a tender gesture, John reaches out and gently touches her knuckles with his fingers. The heroine, concealing her gratitude, speaks gruffly to avoid showing her feelings, though her eyes may reveal her thanksgiving unseen by John.\n\nThe camera captures Rachel's head and shoulders from behind as she walks down a neon-lit street, with a drugstore and loafers in the background, accompanied by the sound of jazz music. Two loafers lounge on a bench, and Ruby approaches them. One loafer gets up and moves towards Ruby, who has caught his eye. She waits by a magazine stand, browsing through lurid, tawdry fan, and pin-up magazines as the loafer approaches in the background.\n\nA preacher enters the scene, standing between Ruby and the loafer, turning to Ruby for a close two-shot. The loafer pauses in the background as Ruby looks up at the preacher admiringly, then back to the loafers. She finishes her soda, a familiar cue to the preacher. Ruby nods, and a magazine slides into the preacher's knife pocket. She watches him stride away into the darkness, the magazine clasped under her chin.\n\nIn a emotional climax, Ruby collapses face down over Rachel's lap, sobbing. They weep together, and Rachel begins to style Ruby's hair like that of a young woman. Ruby nods and shrugs in response. Upon seeing the preacher, Rachel accidentally drops two eggs. The preacher tethers his horse and walks to the bottom of the steps, with Ruby moving into the side of the shot. Beyond the preacher, Rachel stands behind her screen door, hands folded under her apron, observing the scene.",
    "78": "Rachel's gaze is fixed on the screen, observing everything. The Preacher's face contorts with emotion before he bursts into grateful sobs. Meanwhile, Ruby slinks away, disappearing around the side of the house. The Preacher wipes away his tears with his left hand, his eyes following Ruby. Suddenly, he raises his right hand. Simultaneously, all the children enter, coming around the corner of the house. As they approach, Rachel responds to the situation unfolding.\n\nBy this point, John has positioned himself on the top step beside Rachel, one of his hands clutching her skirt as if trying to pull her closer. His gaze remains locked onto hers. All the children stand frozen, with Pearl on the ground just beyond John. He looks up at Rachel, his eyes boring deep into hers. Rachel seeks clarification, realizing that John has betrayed her. She looks off-screen towards the Preacher.\n\nThe Preacher rises to his feet, a knife open in his hand. The barrel of a gun twitches into view. Backing away towards his horse, the Preacher lightly bounces the knife in his hand before mounting the horse.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel sits in profile, her gun resting across her knees on a large bed. Ruby, sitting up, listens to a song playing off-screen. Through the window, the Preacher can be seen hunched on a stump outside. After a moment, Ruby opens her mouth, joining in the hymn to either comfort herself or drown out the Preacher's voice. A descending candle passes by a window as Rachel and the Preacher sing off-screen.\n\nAs the song concludes, Ruby enters the shot carrying a candle, its light darkening the window glass. Rachel looks up and blows out the candle. Through the window, it's evident the Preacher has vanished. Rachel stands up, and Ruby exits the shot. Rachel moves towards the window, looking up to find the children gazing at her with complete trust. She turns and walks back to her chair, the children's eyes following her every move, her own eyes glittering as she turns to face the viewers.\n\nThe clock begins to strike three, drawing Rachel's attention to the sound off-screen. In the mirror, a shadow ducks out of sight. Rachel stands up, gun at the ready, facing into the darkness. With her eyes fixed on the shadows, she bends low to the children, who scatter out of the shot, though Ruby lingers briefly before obeying in a trance. Rachel, her gun poised, stares into the darkness as the Preacher's sinister face and his hand raising the open knife swiftly rise from the floor.\n\nRachel fires her gun, sending the Preacher staggering out. Yelping in pain, he runs into the barn. The children huddle on the stairs in reverent silence. Rachel, with her gun slung casually under one arm, speaks into a wall phone hanging just within the stairway. Later, Rachel sits awake on the screened porch, her gun resting on her knees, with John asleep on the floor, his head leaning against her.",
    "83": "In the beginning, Willa and Icey reluctantly commence their journey, with Willa heading towards the river and Icey making her way to a group of people. The focus shifts to Icey as she encounters a Preacher. With a playful nudge, she directs him towards Willa before joining the women occupied with making fudge. John and Pearl approach the scene, and John gazes intently at Willa and the Preacher, who are framed by the bustling domestic activity around them. The duo settles by the water, under the drooping willows, in a scene that almost parodies a romantic setting. John tilts his head, smiling strangely as he watches his mother intently, his hand held by Pearl. In the background, Walt appears sheepish, and everyone's attention is drawn to Willa.\n\nWilla stands and beckons John, prompting him and Pearl to move towards her, accompanied by Doll. Willa is radiant, but John struggles to hide his emotions, believing Ben has betrayed him. Despite his inner turmoil, he conceals his reactions. Willa warmly touches the Preacher's hand before walking away to join Icey and the other women. John positions himself in front of the Preacher, with Pearl and Doll standing beside him. From John's perspective, the Preacher's hands, labeled \"LOVE\" and \"HATE,\" adjust his necktie. John looks down, then up again, seeing the Preacher, Pearl with her doll, and Willa in the background. Willa begins to run swiftly towards Icey, who welcomes her with open arms, while the group of women stands behind them.\n\nThe scene transitions to a lamplit area, where Birdie sits by his open door, playing the guitar and singing. John's feet are visible as he inspects an overturned skiff. After a few lines of Birdie's song, John emerges from under the boat, leaning against it and tracing a tarry seam with his finger. Birdie continues to strum his guitar lazily as John exits the scene, his curiosity piqued as he peers into Spoon's place while running past. Icey embraces Willa, waltzing her around, as Walt watches with pleasure.\n\nJohn hurriedly makes his way home, where a single window is illuminated in the otherwise dark house. He pauses upon seeing the light, listening intently before cautiously approaching. The camera frames the scene through a tall, narrow shooting frame, with the sides of the screen in darkness. Shooting from inside the screen door, John crosses the porch, softly opens the door, and enters, pausing to listen sharply. Relieved yet puzzled, he tiptoes down the hallway, the camera pulling away as he moves towards the rear in close-up.",
    "88": "In the stark silence of a tense room, all eyes are fixed on an individual, the air thick with anticipation. The stillness is broken only by the awkward pause that follows. Suddenly, Jerry bursts through the kitchen door, clad in a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat, a bag of groceries in hand which he promptly deposits on the kitchen counter. He pulls off his plaid cap, revealing his face. Meanwhile, Wade Gustafson, a vigorous man in his mid-sixties with a full head of gray hair, is present elsewhere.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to an aerial shot of a lonely two-lane highway, bordered by vast snowfields. A solitary car traverses this desolate stretch, driven by Carl Showalter. Beside him, Gaear Grimsrud casts a sour look his way before staring blankly ahead after a prolonged silence.\n\nJerry is seen sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just off the showroom floor, across from an irate customer and his wife.

A phone call interrupts the scene, the phone passed from one person to another.\n\nJerry is then seen wandering through the service area of a garage, where cars are being worked on. He pauses by an Indian mechanic in blue jeans, who is inspecting the underside of a car elevated on a hydraulic lift, a cage light dangling from its innards.\n\nBack on the road, Carl is driving, Grimsrud beside him, smoking and gazing out the window, the landscape passing by as Carl talks on the phone. A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set, a surreal juxtaposition to the events thus far.\n\nJean sets down her coffee cup and rises, startled by the slamming of a door as two men enter. In a panic, she frantically dials a number on a princess phone, her sobs echoing in the room. The phone slips from her hands, clattering across the tile floor, smashing against the door, and bouncing away, its cord ripped free. In desperation, Jean climbs onto the toilet seat and tank to reach a high window, glancing back briefly before escaping.\n\nThe door groans and splinters, the knob falling to the floor as it swings open. Grimsrud and Carl enter the now-empty room, the window wide open. Carl hoists himself out the window, while Grimsrud, with unexpected delicacy, searches the medicine cabinet. His reflection in the mirror reveals the shower curtain drawn around the tub. As he reaches for it, the curtain explodes outward, Jean screaming and thrashing within. She rips the curtain off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom, her fight for survival far from over.",

The scene then shifts to the parking lot, where Jerry, bundled in a parka, emerges into the frigid air.

Both cars pull over, and the trooper approaches Carl's window, his hand resting on his holster. Carl watches, tense, while Grimsrud remains calm, smoking his cigarette as the trooper inspects the car.\n\nThe trooper, taking his time, scans the car's interior, while Grimsrud gazes out the window, unfazed by the tense situation unfolding.",

Carl's anxious smile disappears as a whimpering sound emerges. The officer pauses, then leans into the car to listen. Suddenly, Grimsrud lunges across Carl, grabbing the trooper's hair and slamming his head onto the car door. With his other hand, Grimsrud opens the glove compartment, retrieves a gun, and shoots the officer in the back of the head. Jean screams in horror.\n\nGrimsrud releases the policeman, whose body slumps onto the street. Carl, stunned, exits the car and attempts to lift the officer's body. Headlights from an approaching car interrupt his efforts. Grimsrud, noticing the oncoming vehicle, slides into the driver's seat and accelerates, performing a hasty U-turn. The car speeds away, its red taillights fishtailing in the distance. In the back seat, Jean continues to scream as Grimsrud stubs out his cigarette, his focus on the disappearing taillights ahead.\n\nThe chase intensifies, but Grimsrud struggles to gain ground. Ahead, the fleeing car crashes into a telephone pole, failing to hold a turn. Grimsrud applies the brakes, causing Jean to slide off the back seat into the leg-well. Exiting the car, Grimsrud spots a young man in a parka limping away from the wreck. He raises his gun and fires, sending the young man crashing into the snow.

On the stage, Jose Feliciano performs on a spotlit stool, though the acoustics are poor, causing Carl to grimace.\n\nLater, Carl is engaged in a heated encounter with an escort. Suddenly, the escort is grabbed and flung out of bed. Shep, in a fit of rage, slaps Carl hard, forehand, and backhand, before hauling him up. Shep hits Carl several times, yanks Carl's belt out of his dangling pants, and strangles him with it. Carl gurgles in agony. Shep continues to knee Carl repeatedly, dumps him onto the floor, and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt. Carl’s face is left deeply bruised and cut.\n\nMeanwhile, Jerry is at the kitchen phone. Through the door to the dining room, Wade is seen picking up an extension. The line goes dead, and a door slams off-screen. Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the door, and peels out. The sound of a boot hitting the ground is heard, and Wade mumbles to himself as he drives.\n\nIn a shocking turn, Jerry pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut. Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac and approaches. The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away, and the booth is empty. Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as he passes. Inside the booth, the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body is visible.\n\nThe car pulls into the driveway, and Jerry enters, sitting on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes.

Dan over his shoulder and dashes through the jungle, only to stumble and fall. Undeterred, Forrest rises again as Lt. Dan shouts, his pistol firing at the hidden enemy while Forrest drags him away.

Dan's yells echoing behind him.\n\nDesperately searching for Bubba, Forrest slows his pace to scan the surroundings meticulously. He finds Bubba lying on the ground, a palm frond clutched over his wound. Forrest removes the frond, uncovering a grim sight: Bubba's chest is blown open. As the distant voices of the enemy resonate, Forrest hoists Bubba up and carries him through the jungle. The air trembles with the growing roar of approaching planes, their din soon deafening. Three planes swoop down, raining napalm and detonating colossal fireballs that engulf the jungle. Forrest, with Bubba in his arms, runs as explosions erupt behind them, the entire area ablaze.\n\nReaching the riverbank, Forrest finds Lt. Dan and the other wounded soldiers awaiting a rescue helicopter. He looks down at Bubba as a soldier activates a smoke canister, signaling their location.

In a show of support, Abbie Hoffman approaches Forrest, giving him a reassuring pat on the shoulder before raising his fist defiantly. The crowd erupts in cheers, their earlier restlessness replaced with enthusiastic approval. Abbie then steps back, allowing Forrest to command the stage alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Jenny ventures into the reflecting pool, waving her hand in the air, catching Forrest's attention.

Forrest ascends onto the stage, greeting Cavett with a handshake before taking his seat between the host and John Lennon. Forrest casts a peculiar glance at Lennon, who casually lights a cigarette.\n\nFollowing his appearance, Forrest is escorted out through a side entrance. As he exits, he is halted by the voice of a man in a wheelchair—Lt. Dan, who is disheveled with long, unkempt hair. Unfortunately, Lt. Dan's wheelchair slips down a ramp, spinning on the icy surface.

She smears lines of cocaine on a mirror, gazing at her reflection before stepping out onto a high-rise balcony.

The wind gently sweeps fallen leaves across the ground, adding a touch of nostalgia to the moment.\n\nAs the newlyweds and their son walk hand-in-hand toward the house, Forrest later enters Jenny's bedroom, carrying a breakfast tray. He watches her sleep peacefully, and she slowly awakens, her gaze meeting his. Forrest then finds himself standing on his boat, gazing at a breathtaking sunset painted in deep orange and red hues.

She reaches out to take his hand, a simple gesture filled with emotion. The scene then shifts to a heart-wrenching moment as Forrest stands beneath the old oak tree where Jenny has been laid to rest. He tries to hold back his tears, watching as Jenny's childhood home is demolished by a bulldozer.

As he walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead, landing in the tree. Forrest turns to watch, a mix of sadness and acceptance in his eyes.\n\nThe film's final scenes are filled with symbolism. A bus drives toward them, and Forrest Jr. boards it, recognizing the same bus driver who once drove his father to school. With a wave and an approving nod from Forrest, the bus pulls away.

Off-screen, the gun fires twice. Phyllis shudders in his arms, tears filling her eyes before her head falls limp against his shoulder.\n\nCarefully, almost tenderly, Neff lifts Phyllis and carries her to the davenport, laying her down softly. Moonlight streaming through the French doors highlights the anklet one last time. Neff lingers for a moment before slowly turning away, his hand emerging from his coat stained with blood.",
    "113": "Neff strides past the watchman, ignoring his query, and heads straight for the elevator. The night watchman secures the door again and trails behind Neff, joining him in the elevator. Neff, despite his pallid and worn appearance from pain, maintains a stoic facade. The watchman operates the elevator, and the doors slide shut, ascending to the designated floor.\n\nUpon reaching their destination, the elevator doors open to reveal a dimly lit reception area. Directly across the room, frosted glass doors bear the inscription: \"PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE.\" A soft glow emanates from beyond the doors. Neff collects himself and trudges out of the elevator, making his way towards the doors. He pushes them open, unveiling a vast, darkened workspace on the eleventh floor, teeming with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and other office paraphernalia. The twelfth floor, in contrast, is shrouded in darkness, with only a faint light from below illuminating the space where two cleaning ladies are at work.\n\nNeff's faint smile betrays his amusement at the scene below. He walks along the balcony, passing several offices before stopping at a door marked \"27,\" bearing the names Henry B. Anderson, Walter Neff, and Louis L. Schwartz. Inside, the office houses three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter, and a dictaphone with a rack of records beneath it. Each desk is equipped with a telephone.\n\nUpon entering, Neff flicks on the desk lamp. His head lolls back, eyes squeezed shut, as beads of cold sweat form on his brow. Moments pass before his eyes flutter open, gazing down at his left shoulder. With his good hand, he peels back his overcoat, unbuttons his jacket, and loosens his tie and shirt, the exertion leaving him winded. Panting, he fingers a cigarette pack from his shirt pocket, discovering bloodstains upon inspection. He empties the pack, selects an untainted cigarette, and lights it, taking a deep drag before turning his attention to the dictaphone.\n\nNeff drags himself and the swivel chair towards the device, lifts the horn, and presses the button. As the record begins to turn, he starts to speak but abruptly halts, placing the horn back onto the desk.",
    "121": "In the opening scene, a man takes a few quick puffs from his cigarette before extinguishing it, then picks up a telephone to continue his conversation. As he speaks, the scene gradually transitions to reveal a suburban street lined with palm trees and middle-class Spanish-style houses. Children play catch with a baseball on their front lawns, while an ice cream truck slowly makes its way down the block. A coupe, driven by Walter Neff, cruises past the truck and comes to a stop in front of one of the houses.\n\nNeff emerges from his car, briefcase in hand, his hat tilted back slightly, and with a confident stride, he approaches the house, checking the number before ringing the doorbell. He pushes past a maid and enters a home adorned with Spanish-inspired decor. A wrought-iron staircase descends from the second floor, draped with a fringed Mexican shawl, and a large tapestry hangs on the wall. Looking up, Neff sees Phyllis Dietrichson, a woman in her early thirties, wrapped in a bath towel that reveals her legs up to just above her knees. She turns away, and Neff, removing his hat, watches her retreat. He then speaks briefly to the maid while still gazing upwards, then strides through an archway into the living room. The maid goes off in another direction.\n\nIn the living room, Neff tosses his briefcase and hat onto a plush sofa and takes a moment to survey the room. He approaches a baby grand piano adorned with a worn Spanish shawl and two photographs. The first photo is of Mr. Dietrichson, a solidly built man in his early fifties with glasses, and the second is of Lola Dietrichson, a 19-year-old girl with a wistful expression. Neff briefly examines the photos before pacing across the rug, noticing a wrinkled corner. Hearing high heels clicking on the staircase, he turns to see Phyllis descending the stairs. The camera reveals her elegantly attired in a pale blue summer dress, complete with pom-pom slippers and a gold anklet. As she reaches the bottom of the stairs, Neff moves to the sofa to retrieve papers from his briefcase. Phyllis, turning away from a mirror, takes a seat in a large chair, her legs tucked up sideways, revealing the anklet more clearly.",
    "122": "Phyllis, with a faint smile, adjusts her dress to conceal her anklet, then stands up and begins to pace, her attention waning. Meanwhile, Neff scrutinizes the insurance policies he's holding. Phyllis abruptly stops pacing, returns to her seat, and resumes her previous position. Neff's gaze is drawn to the anklet once again. Preparing to leave, Neff retrieves his hat and briefcase. Together, they move towards the archway, and Neff exits, leaving Phyllis behind.\n\nHanding his hat and briefcase to Phyllis, Neff continues on to a door bearing a sign. Grinning, he enters a cluttered executive office. Behind the desk sits Sam Gorlopis, a towering, brutish figure in grimy work clothes, his face broad and his eyes small and beady. He clutches a sweat-stained hat, his hairy hand resting on his knee. Noticing Neff, he casts a wary glance at Keyes, then pounds his stomach forcefully, making Gorlopis flinch. A blank form is placed before Gorlopis, who hesitates before signing it with effort. As Gorlopis departs, Keyes slowly turns his cigar stub in the flame of a match, then faces Neff.\n\nExiting Keyes' office, Neff traverses the balcony, passing secretaries bustling in and out of doors. He enters his own office, where Anderson, a salesman, is completing a report at one of the desks. Neff approaches his desk, peruses his mail, and takes a seat, flipping through his desk calendar.\n\nMeanwhile, Phyllis descends the stairs, her high heels clicking on the tiles, the anklet sparkling on her leg. Reaching the entrance hall, her vibrant print dress with a wide sash comes into full view. She opens the door to reveal Neff, casually dressed in a sport coat and flannel slacks, smiling as he removes his hat. Stepping inside, he follows Phyllis into the living room. She guides him to a low tea table laden with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, and a pot of tea. Phyllis pours herself a glass of tea.",
    "123": "In the opening scene, a woman prepares a glass of tea for a man who is surveying his surroundings. She offers him the beverage, and after taking it, he collects his hat and departs. She watches him leave, her gaze following him as Neff exits through the front door, hurriedly makes his way to his car, and drives off. The scene shifts to Neff sitting in his car, where a carhop serves him a bottle of beer. Later, Neff is seen bowling, but his mind is clearly elsewhere, his attempts to concentrate on the game futile.\n\nThe camera then pans up a six-story building in the Normandie-Wilshire district, pausing at the top floor windows as a light rain begins to fall. Inside, Neff stands by the window, his coat off and tie loosened, as raindrops gently tap against the glass. Restless, he paces around the room, pausing briefly to take a few swings with a golf club before tossing it aside and resuming his anxious stride.\n\nA knock at the door interrupts his pacing. Opening it, he finds a woman standing there, her only possession a small bag. She steps inside, and Neff closes the door behind her, switching on a nearby standing lamp. As she starts to remove her coat, he takes it from her and drapes it over a chair. The woman, Phyllis, moves towards the window, her gaze fixed on the rain-streaked pane.\n\nNeff approaches Phyllis, taking her wrist and drawing her close. They share a slow kiss, her arms tightening around him. Pulling back slightly, he still holds her close before finally letting her go and moving towards the dinette. The small space contains a table, chairs, and a low glass-and-china cabinet, beyond which lies a compact kitchen.\n\nNeff retrieves a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, holding it under the hot-water faucet to loosen them. Phyllis joins him, glasses in hand, which she passes to him. He drops ice cubes into each glass, grabs a whiskey bottle from atop the china closet, and prepares their drinks. With drinks in hand, they retreat to the living room, sinking onto the davenport side by side. Neff pulls her close, their heads touching as the camera slowly starts to recede, leaving the couple in a intimate embrace.",
    "130": "In the gripping opening, a man begins to descend, inspiring others around him with the confidence in his voice. Gandhi is struck by the power of this idea, and as the sound of galloping horses approaches, he turns and raises his voice as well. Miners start to lie down, some facing up and shielding their faces, others burying their faces in the dirt, hands protecting their heads. A sergeant's point of view shows the miners prone on the ground. Gandhi, arms crossed in front of his face, stares upward, frightened yet resolved. The horses, unable to trample the human sea, rear and swerve.\n\nThe sergeant is thrown off his horse, landing heavily. Enraged, he scrambles up and chases after his steed. Once mounted, his fury intensifies at the sound of laughter. Gandhi's command, though angry, carries the weight of his influence, and the miners begin to lie down again. The sergeant, incensed, charges at Gandhi on horseback. With a deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi kneels and then sprawls flat, hands covering his head, awaiting the horse's hoof. The horse's eyes roll as it swerves again, the sergeant cursing yet unable to force it to trample Gandhi.\n\nFrustrated, the sergeant wheels his horse, surveying the sprawled protesters and his confused police. He turns his horse angrily and gallops back towards the factories. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed watch the retreating horses. In the distance, a car with a civilian returns. The sergeant regroups with his police, lining up across the road. Undeterred, Gandhi and the miners advance once more, chanting forcefully.\n\nIn a tense gathering elsewhere, a congregation listens to a man speak, their bodies stiff and unsympathetic. Some murmur in assent, while others rise and escorts their families out of the church. The clergyman, having offered his pulpit, sits embarrassed but resolute. More of the congregation exit, though a few remain defiantly.\n\n Meanwhile, Gandhi navigates a line for soup, winding through masses of prisoners. Some hold bowls and eat, others await their turn. As Gandhi nears the soup barrels, he sees Khan serving from one of them.",
    "132": "In anticipation, the officer commanding and the Guard of Honor stand ready, awaiting the arrival of a significant figure. A young Englishman casts a curious glance his way. The General, having taken the salute, proceeds to inspect the troops, accompanied by the martial tunes of a military band. Suddenly, he notices a well-dressed Indian nearby, seemingly half-listening to their conversation. The Indian acknowledges the General's glance with a subtle nod before stepping back slightly. Meanwhile, another Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman, then looks away.\n\nElsewhere, a simpler gangplank extends from the ship's aft, where third-class passengers disembark, separated by a wire fence from the main pier. A throng of Indians excitedly reacts to someone descending this gangplank, though the individual remains unseen. The young Englishman cautiously glances back at the well-dressed Indian again. The mystery figure is revealed to be Gandhi, smiling and attempting to move forward while responding to an Indian journalist's questions. Overwhelmed by the reception, he speaks with a uncertainty he had shed in South Africa.\n\nAn English journalist intercepts Gandhi as he turns, while an eager woman places a garland over his shoulders. Behind him, an Indian reporter engages Ba, who acknowledges a garland placed around her shoulders with joined hands, then follows Gandhi with Charlie's guidance. Jawaharlal Nehru, amused by the commotion, escorts Gandhi through the crowd to a flower-adorned platform bearing a banner that reads \"THE CONGRESS PARTY.\" Nehru grins as he guides Gandhi to the first step, where another garland is draped around his shoulders. With a hint of embarrassment, Gandhi ascends the platform to a roaring cheer, followed by a silence that allows the distant military band to be heard.\n\nGandhi surveys the crowd before finally addressing them, concluding with a pranam and stepping down. The crowd, though slightly disappointed, manages a cheer and applause. Nehru stands with a heavy-set, well-dressed man named Patel. He slams the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car after seating Gandhi inside with Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack. An Indian chauffeur occupies the front seat. As the car attempts to depart, Gandhi anxiously searches for Ba, while Nehru grins reassuringly, amused by Gandhi's evident bewilderment.\n\nWith Gandhi still looking back apprehensively, the car pulls away. He eventually turns to Patel, who observes Gandhi with a critical eye as they wave to the crowds lining the streets, Gandhi tentative, Patel more assured. The scene unfolds as Gandhi begins to realize the magnitude of the reception in his honor, the streets teeming with well-wishers eager to greet him.",
    "134": "The movie opens with a thrilling shot of a train racing along a river, the sun's reflection dancing on the windows. The train comes to a halt under the high midday sun, revealing an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches tentatively dipping his toe into the water. Nearby, children of British enlisted soldiers splash and play, their laughter filling the air. Across the river, a group of Indian women from the Third Class coaches squat by the water's edge, washing clothes with infants on their backs and small children nearby. Their eyes, however, are fixed on the train passengers, even as they continue their washing ritual.\n\nAmong the Third Class passengers stands Gandhi, accompanied by Ba and Charlie. Charlie, with his trousers rolled up, engages in a cautious splashing game with a thin Indian boy. Gandhi holds a large white head cloth, soaking it in the water, but his gaze is captured by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies are frail, and their clothes, which appeared normal from afar, are mere rags. Gandhi pauses, his eyes locked on the scene for a long moment.\n\nThe landscape shifts to green hills as the train climbs through a different terrain. The journey is intercut with scenes of a boy and a buffalo operating a crude grinding wheel, and farmers working in terraced fields. Gandhi leans out of a Third Class coach window, observing alongside other passengers. Ahead, they discover a derailed military train, consisting of an engine and two cars. A small British cavalry troop approaches, their leader visibly furious.\n\nMeanwhile, Nehru takes a sip of an iced drink from a servant, shaking his head wistfully. The train presses on, revealing the Third Class section crowded with people clinging to the doors and seated on the roofs. Gandhi and Charlie ride on the outside, clearly enjoying the experience, while Ba, inside the packed coach, looks distinctly unamused, gripping Gandhi's arm tightly.\n\nThe camera then focuses on Jinnah, capturing his impassioned speech and the audience's enthusiastic cheers. Newspaper photographers crowd around the platform, snapping photos, as Patel steps forward from the back, applauding.",
    "148": "In the tense courtroom, Gandhi takes the stand, a hint of surprise and emotion flickering across his face as he surveys the scene. He looks up at the judge, and for a brief moment, their gazes lock. The judge acknowledges Gandhi with a slight bow, which Gandhi reciprocates respectfully, before the judge takes his seat. Reporters in the room shrug in disbelief, exchanging incredulous glances as they settle back down.\n\nThe Advocate General begins to speak, reading from a folded journal, causing a ripple of shock throughout the courtroom. He turns to the judge with a smile of brittle disdain. The judge nods, then glances at the empty defense counsel table before turning his attention to Gandhi. This gesture seems almost a cruel challenge to the visibly humane judge, Broomfield. Reporters scribble furiously, their eyes fixed on the judge, noting the doubt on his face that reflects the ambiguous stance of the British in India.\n\nBroomfield lowers his glasses soberly, staring at them for a moment before looking up at Gandhi, his respect for the man palpably evident. A stunned silence grips the courtroom as the clerk records the sentence. The judge lowers his eyes, folding and refolding his glasses before rising stiffly and exiting to his chambers, the court standing in deference. He pauses, staring at Broomfield, his face now mirroring the respect he has for Gandhi.\n\nThe scene shifts to a distant vista, where a car is seen traveling along a road, its style indicating the passage of several years. The reporter from the New York Times, previously seen as a younger man in South Africa, is in an open car, his face intrigued by the sight before him. From his vantage point, an Indian woman is seen walking along the road, leading a tall camel laden with produce. Two young girls in ragged saris and a boy leading a smaller camel accompany her, all staring at the car. The vehicle, revealed to be an early 1930s Morris Minor, navigates around another procession of camels heading towards the port, with Collins steering in surprise.\n\nInside the serene temple, Ba stands facing Gandhi. Walker and Collins sit in the cool shadows, captivated as they observe Gandhi and Ba renewing their marriage vows. Walker occasionally jots down notes, but his gaze remains fixed on the couple, who are lost in the profound memories and emotions of their shared past. Before the temple's altar, Gandhi and Ba move closer together, their bond deep and meaningful.",
    "150": "In the throes of a critical moment, Irwin, having listened intently, begins to grasp the situation, causing the principal secretary to pale. Irwin glances at his ADC, paces thoughtfully, then turns to the general who voices his opinion. This exchange solidifies Irwin's resolve; he's visibly angry yet resolute.\n\nSuddenly, a multitude of people emerges from behind an embankment, ascending steps from the river. The camera pans up, revealing a vast human chain stretching across the water to the city's distant edges. Around the ashram, fires blaze as people prepare breakfast and pack for a journey, while others scatter leaves along the path. A quiet hum of activity fills the air.\n\nGandhi grins at Mirabehn, who is massaging his legs, then smiles and turns towards his bungalow. Ba, Mirabehn, and Desai watch him intently. Holding their gaze briefly, Gandhi starts forward, with Pyarelal by his side and marchers trailing behind. Along the path, a sparser crowd waits, along with police—a British officer and sergeant, and Indian constables standing beside their vehicles.\n\nAs Gandhi approaches, Walker, the newsman Collins in tow, joins him, anxious about the impending police encounter. Gandhi nods amiably at the officers, Walker's unease growing as no arrest occurs. He stays close to Gandhi, eyeing the police warily. Walker, also wearing a knapsack, nods politely at the British officer as they pass. Stopping, he jots notes in his notebook, Collins at his side, while the procession marches on.\n\nThe journey leads to a modest village, its entrance lined with hopeful peasants clutching flowers and leaves. Independence colors adorn the village. Two stern policemen stand at the front, their authority undercut by children weaving around them.",
    "153": "In the throes of youthful vigor, a man sprawls on the ground, poised to retaliate. Suddenly, Nehru lurches towards him, only to be brutally struck by a lathi that crashes against the side of his head. Blood seeps into Nehru's hand as he touches the wound, struggling to stand and confront the policeman who hit him. The Viceroy, observing the scene, ponders the event favorably, while a senior police officer is jolted by the cold, direct action. Uncertain, the officer glances at Irwin and the principal secretary. As he turns to depart, Irwin comments almost casually, leaving the senior officer staring in response.\n\nBarbed wire flanks the imposing entrance of the Dharasana Salt Works, where a tense standoff unfolds. Six British and two Indian police officers command a large troop of Indian policemen, facing a massive group of volunteers equally taut with anticipation. Off to the side, Walker climbs onto the back of Collin's car, his gaze darting nervously between the two groups, terrified of the impending conflict. Collins stands nearby, equally appalled. Two other reporters are close by. From Walker's vantage point, Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly prepare stretchers and bandages near the volunteers' tents.\n\nThe air is thick with tension as a man approaches the chief police officer, pausing politely before proceeding towards the gate and the awaiting police lathis. Azad leads the first row of volunteers down and up the slope. Walker watches, frozen, as the British police commander readies to give the order, his voice half-steady with emotion.\n\nMeanwhile, Irwin sits in shadows behind his desk, still shocked, staring at Gandhi. He faces Gandhi stiffly, the whirr of a camera capturing the moment. The scene cuts to a wide screen, reminiscent of old newsreels, revealing Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Desai waving goodbye from their ship, Mirabehn holding a goat's tether, all smiling like seasoned travelers.",
    "154": "In the bustling East End of London, a cheering crowd eagerly greets Mahatma Gandhi as he stands on the steps of Kingsley Hall. By his side, the now gray-haired Charlie Andrews beams with pride and a sense of ownership. Gandhi, clad in his simple dhoti, waves to the assembled crowd as he enters the grand gates of Buckingham Palace. Inside, he takes his seat at a conference table surrounded by delegates dressed in formal attire, some Maharajahs even donning elaborate garments. The meeting commences with Ramsay MacDonald striking a gavel and delivering his opening address. Gandhi, dressed in his signature white suit and black-ribboned pince-nez, sits on a wicker chair. Nehru and Patel lean against the railing, while Azad and Kripalani join Gandhi on the floor.\n\nAs Gandhi concludes his remarks and begins to rise, he moves towards the steps but pauses to look at Patel, offering a wry, gentle smile. Turning to Jinnah, he shrugs, a gesture that Jinnah receives with burning anger as Gandhi heads towards a young girl nursing an injured goat.\n\nLater, Gandhi is seen disembarking from the Third Class section of a ship, accompanied by Ba and Mirabehn, who struggle to keep up, along with Desai and Pyarelal. A stern British captain commands a full platoon of Indian troops as Gandhi approaches. The British Lieutenant Colonel and his Adjutant step forward, and Gandhi stops, looking up at them and the troops behind. With a weary grin, he shakes his head. The colonel signals to the troops, and a detail marches forward. The adjutant attempts to speak gently to Ba, but she stares back defiantly, leaving him flummoxed. The colonel and his adjutant then stride towards the station's exit, followed by a detail of six soldiers escorting Gandhi, Ba, and Mirabehn, each accompanied by their own escort of soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, a jeep driven by an American lieutenant bounces along a road, carrying Margaret Bourke-White, dressed in her War Correspondent's uniform. As the jeep passes, the walls of a majestic palace come into view. Bourke-White absorbs the sight, her journalist's appetite and sensitivity capturing every detail.\n\nBack in his peaceful surroundings, Gandhi sits by a grilled window, spinning in a shaft of light. His hair, once half-gray in London, has turned completely white. The sound of a camera click and the rustle of movement fill the air as he continues his contemplative task.",
    "158": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film begins with **Mahatma Gandhi approaching a car**, flanked by **Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad**, with **Pyarelal trailing close behind**. As they venture out, **a Hindu youth bearing a black flag hails Gandhi**, visibly awestruck amidst the tense atmosphere. Gandhi casts a stern, weary glance at the youth and the assembled crowd before proceeding to the car, where **Hermann Kallenbach awaits with the door open**, trailing Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal. Nearby, **a second car sits beside two trucks filled with youths**, with **two men in the back seat—one of them being Prakash**, who would later be present at Gandhi's assassination.\n\nIn the next scene, **Muhammad Ali Jinnah stands on a balcony**, impeccably dressed, gazing down at Gandhi with slight disdain. Gandhi sits on the floor below, just finishing his prayers, accompanied by **Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel, and Azad**. Jinnah descends to join them, and Gandhi hesitates before speaking. Jinnah, taken aback by Gandhi's offer, studies him briefly before turning to the others, who are clearly surprised. Nehru looks uncertainly at Gandhi, revealing the divide between Gandhi's resolve and their hesitation.\n\nThe action shifts to a pivotal moment in history: **Lord Mountbatten and Nehru stand on a platform** as the Indian National Anthem plays and the **Indian flag is hoisted** amidst a tumultuous crowd. Meanwhile, **Jinnah and a British dignitary** oversee the raising of the **Pakistani flag** as its new anthem echoes. A poignant scene follows, where **an empty flagpole stands as a stark symbol** of the division between the two new nations.\n\nTowards the end, **Gandhi is seen sitting alone on his bungalow's porch, spinning his wheel**, its hum the only soundtrack.

    "161": "The film opens with a sweeping shot of a crowded gathering, the camera gliding past loudspeakers on poles, capturing the restless energy of the scene. The audience is a mix of engaged listeners and sullen, aggressive young individuals loitering on the edges. The focus shifts to a platform where Jawaharlal Nehru is delivering a speech, with prominent figures like Azad and Suhrawardy seated on the floor behind him. Suhrawardy, a Muslim leader, leans tensely against a wall, his gaze fixed on an unseen action, his expression taut with evident tension.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandhi faces five men clad in dirty black trousers and knit vests, their muscular arms bound with thongs, accentuating their powerful physiques. They lay down an array of knives and guns at Gandhi's feet, a symbol of surrender or challenge. On a nearby rooftop, Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, a doctor, and others observe the scene, their expressions a blend of fascination and fear.\n\nGandhi's gaze locks onto one of the men, his eyes probing, neither offering nor accepting empty gestures. The men, known as Goondas, begin to leave after glancing at Suhrawardy, who acknowledges them with a tight smile. However, one of them, Nahari, lingers behind, his emotions boiling over. Suddenly, he lunges at Gandhi, pulling a chapati from his trousers and hurling it forcefully. Mirabehn and Azad move to intervene, but Gandhi raises a trembling hand, stopping them.\n\nNahari's face is a contorted mask of anger and fear, his instability radiating a wild menace. Gandhi stares at him, seemingly understanding the man's inner turmoil. Nahari, compelled by an unknown force, indicates the height of his son with his hand. He glares at Suhrawardy, then back at Gandhi, his sobs wracked with anger, as if contemplating a violent retaliation. A tense moment ensues as Gandhi meets Nahari's pain and wrath head-on.\n\nNahari sneers, but a flicker of desperate curiosity crosses his face. Gandhi raises his hand to the height Nahari indicated, a silent acknowledgment. Nahari listens, his face briefly softening, but the light of understanding fails to illuminate his inner darkness completely. Struggling with his emotions, Nahari turns to leave but pauses after a single step. He falls to his knees, sobbing, as he presses his head to Gandhi's feet in a traditional Hindu greeting. Gandhi reaches out, touching the top of Nahari's head in a moment of profound connection.\n\nElsewhere, trucks filled with riot squads, armed with shields and truncheons, stand ready but idle, their occupants lounging, waiting for orders, unaware of the transformative scene unfolding nearby.",
    "164": "In a tense and emotionally charged scene, a woman struggles to break free from the grip of a constable, but is firmly restrained. Meanwhile, the sergeant turns his attention from the commotion to witness Gandhi, his head bleeding, slowly rising to his knees to pick up another card. A captivated crowd, a newspaper reporter, and a distraught Ba watch in silence. With a mix of anger and restraint, the sergeant observes Gandhi lift the card and, after a moment's hesitation, drop it into the basket. Overcome by a sense of duty, the sergeant strikes Gandhi again, a look of distaste flashing across his face as Gandhi slumps.\n\nBa’s face is streaked with tears, and the newspaper reporter watches intently, not taking notes. Khan, standing by the paddy wagon, gazes in awe. Despite his severe injuries, Gandhi valiantly rises to his knees again, searching the ground for another card. His fingers finally grasp one, and the sergeant's face reflects deep uncertainty and confusion. Undeterred, Gandhi lifts the card and drops it into the basket, prompting the sergeant to strike him again, this time with clear reluctance.\n\nThe crowd and the reporter hold their breath, transfixed by the unfolding scene. The sergeant, gripping his club, sees Gandhi weakly lift his head, his bloodied hands searching for another card. The scene shifts to a gas-lit room, elegantly furnished in the Victorian style. Ba gently removes Gandhi's suit coat, carefully examining the bandages on his head and face. Gandhi sits cautiously on the bed, where newspapers are spread out, some in English. Ba tenderly checks his bandages.\n\nSuddenly, there's a knock at the door. An Indian nursemaid, or ayah, enters proudly with Gandhi's sons: Harilal, Manilal, and Ramdas, dressed in European suits. They step forward one by one, performing the traditional Hindu greeting, pranam, and kissing Gandhi’s feet. Gandhi smiles warmly, especially as Ramdas runs to him for a hug. The boys bow respectfully and leave, their disciplined behavior evident. The ayah closes the door behind them, their chatter echoing down the hall.\n\nExhausted, Gandhi stretches out on the bed, picking up another newspaper. Ba sits beside him, carefully adjusting his bandages.",
    "167": "In a charged standoff, Gandhi and Ba lock eyes, both seething with anger. As Ba begins to rise, Gandhi grasps her arm, but she swiftly breaks free. She delivers a stinging, derisive remark, testing Gandhi's temper, which he struggles to keep in check in the presence of Walker. Ba settles back, her expression defiant. They exchange a resentful stare.\n\nSuddenly, Gandhi reaches down and seizes Ba's arm, forcefully pulling her to her feet. A hushed yet violent struggle ensues as he drags her toward the rear door, eventually pushing her out despite her resistance. Breathless, Gandhi's anger subsides into a dazed remorse. He collapses onto a stool, head in hands, overwhelmed.\n\nBa observes him, her own temper cooling as her breathing evens out. She moves to kneel before him, and after a moment, soothes the top of his head with a maternal touch. Gandhi looks up, his expression blank and abject. A weak grin crosses his face, which Ba returns with a warmer, less doubtful smile. Gandhi sighs, wrapping his arms around her as they lean into each other, heads touching. Ba nods, and Gandhi holds her at arm's length to study her. She meets his gaze evenly, her eyes warm despite the absence of a smile.\n\nThe theater is packed with a diverse crowd. Rich Muslim merchants occupy the front rows, while the rear is filled with small traders, peddlers, and artisans of various faiths. The gallery teems with predominantly Hindu indentured laborers, the atmosphere restless and belligerent. Gandhi steps forward, raising his hand to silence the crowd.\n\nSeated on the stage are notable figures of the Indian community, including Khan and Singh. At the end of the row sit Charlie Andrews and Herman Kallenbach. Gandhi surveys the audience, his gaze eventually landing on two conspicuous European plainclothes policemen seated at the end of the front row, a uniformed officer standing nearby.\n\nA buzz of anticipation gives way to loud, defiant applause. As it subsides, Gandhi focuses on the policemen, sparking another burst of applause. The officers remain stone-faced, confident and unmoved. A rhythmic pounding echoes from the gallery, signaling growing anger and protest, but the police stare on, imperturbable.\n\nOn stage, Khan leans toward Singh, nodding in Gandhi's direction. Singh smiles at Khan's understatement. Gandhi raises his hand once more, silencing the hall, which now awaits his words, the air thick with tension and expectation. A formidable merchant rises in the third row, ready to challenge Gandhi's message.",

Later, Chili finds himself in a plush office, sitting across from Dick Allen, who is adorned with an abundance of jewelry. Behind Dick, a giant neon cowgirl sign gleams through the window. Dick hands a snapshot back to Chili, then turns his gaze to a minivan parked outside. Chili, giving the driver a stern look, steps out of the bus into the pouring rain, left stranded with no shelter.\n\nThe scene shifts to a darkened house, where only the blue glow of a television illuminates one of the downstairs rooms. Inside, Harry Zimm, a balding and overweight movie producer, stirs in his bed. He grunts, gets up, and starts looking around for his clothes, his curiosity piqued by a familiar voice from downstairs. Harry moves cautiously through the entry hall towards the flickering light of the television. As he enters the room, the big Sony TV displays an interview with actor Martin Weir, but the screen suddenly goes black, and a desk lamp flickers on.\n\n Startled, Harry jumps. Chili leans into the light, his tone quiet and controlled. Harry, trying to regain his composure, presses a hand against his chest and slowly slides it down his belly, attempting to appear calm. He stares at Chili, trying to place him. Chili nods slightly, almost smiling. Harry reaches for the phone, dialing '0', but Chili casually leans forward and hangs it up with his index finger. Harry, resigning to the situation, sits down. He starts to take a drink but pauses, looking at Chili, who shakes his head thoughtfully.\n\nTheir conversation intensifies as Karen descends the stairs. Chili and Harry are now seated at a butcher block table, a bottle of Dewars and a couple of glasses between them. Chili turns and sees Karen standing in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest, wearing an oversized Lakers T-shirt. Leo, present in the scene, becomes visibly uncomfortable. He motions for another drink, but as he does, a plane taxis past the window in the background, and Leo's head hits the table. Suddenly, a massive fireball erupts in the background.\n\nIn a dramatic turn, Fay reacts strongly as an FFA guy points to a little green hat on one of the tables. She grabs it, clutching it to her chest, and pretends to faint, adding a theatrical flair to the already tense situation.",
    "171": "Karen, despite her initial reluctance, finds herself drawn into listening. Meanwhile, a handsome man confidently raises the stakes from three hundred to half a million. As Chili begins to speak, Harry abruptly interrupts him. Harry then turns his attention back to Chili, who looks over at Karen. She finds herself staring at Chili again, her gaze fixed and patient. Observing the two men seated there, Karen notices Harry turning towards Chili, and both men looking back at her. She holds Chili's gaze briefly before turning and walking out. Chili watches her leave, his gaze following her until she's out of sight.\n\nHarry pauses thoughtfully, nodding, before Chili looks back at him. The scene shifts to reveal a little kid listening to a Walkman. Harry notices the child and points across the street to the Café Med, where a red Ferrari convertible is parked out front. Inside the café, Martin Weir and a woman with jet-black hair are seated at a table. Harry and Chili observe them for a moment before Harry starts the car and begins driving again.\n\nInside the car, there are photographs of Karen, Harry, and a much younger, blonde Karen. Chili stands, looking over the old photographs as Harry sifts through the clutter on the desk. Harry hands a movie script to Chili, who examines the cover, holding a script for the first time. He opens it to the middle, his curiosity piqued.\n\nChili's attention is drawn to the window as a long black stretch limo pulls up to the curb down on the street. He tosses the script onto the desk and moves between a pair of fat red leather chairs. Harry, moving away from the window, tugs at the string to lower the blinds behind the desk. The sound of Ronnie singing fills the air as the door opens, and the Bear ushers Bo Catlett and Ronnie into the office.\n\nChili, seated behind the desk, watches as Catlett enters first, followed by Ronnie, who sits down and nervously swings one leg over the arm of the chair, his energy fueled by some chemical. Harry waves them into the two cracked red leather chairs facing the desk. Catlett nods to Chili, who ignores him, incredulous that Harry is already forgetting his instructions. Chili can't believe what he's hearing and shakes his head in disbelief.\n\nThe limo guys nod to Chili, who tries to catch Harry's eye. Ronnie and Bo Catlett both look over, their attention now focused on Chili. Catlett studies Chili, contemplating whether to make a move, when Harry intervenes, reaching over the desk to pick up a script. Chili looks at Harry, wondering if there's a way to silence him without resorting to violence. The tension in the room is palpable as the scene comes to a close.",
    "173": "In the opening sequence, a man pauses to look at a woman before continuing on his way. They eventually halt at her car, and he watches as she drives off. The scene shifts to an airport where a plane lands on the runway, and the man is seen standing vigilantly by a row of lockers. Yayo, drenched in sweat, is also present, his eyes fixed on one particular locker. The camera zooms in, and the man starts to move towards the locker but abruptly looks away. The focus shifts down to reveal a suspicious bulge near the ankle of both the man and a nearby woman, who is casually dressed and tapping her foot to an unheard rhythm.\n\nThe man lights a cigarette, his gaze fixed off-screen, frozen in place. Meanwhile, Yayo leans against a railing, exchanging a satisfied look with Bear. Bo Catlett, also leaning on the railing, glances down at Yayo. Bear takes notice of Bo.\n\nThe scene transitions to a different location where Chili points to a star on a map. Suddenly, a tall, skinny woman with wild, jet-black hair appears at the front door, drawing everyone's attention. Karen begins to respond, but Nicki swiftly ushers Chili inside. Chili enters, his eyes scanning the photographs that adorn the walls, most of which feature Martin. In the background, a vast backyard is visible, and for some reason, this sight comforts Karen. Chili follows her gaze.\n\nIn a somewhat awkward moment, a man hugs the woman tightly, leaving Nicki and Chili standing nearby, feeling out of place. Karen suppresses a smile, while Nicki nods solemnly. Outside, a gardener is busy blowing leaves. The walls are lined with Martin's extensive photography collection, executed in a style reminiscent of cracked oils.\n\nMartin, Karen, and Chili sit together on white couches. Martin appreciatively observes Karen, nodding thoughtfully. Karen, however, appears nauseated and ready to concede. Martin suddenly laughs at his own thoughts, and Karen and Chili join in, with Karen leaning into Chili. Chili watches as Martin hunches over, his shoulders narrowing. Karen shakes her head, briefly looking away while Martin holds his hands together, a shifty look in his eyes. She fights back a smile as Martin stares at Chili, his expression becoming increasingly deadpan. Martin nods, giving Chili a blank, sleepy look. Chili and Karen exchange glances, with Karen thoroughly enjoying Chili's manipulation of Martin. Chili leans back, and Karen begins to find amusement in Chili's handling of the situation, shaking her head as she looks at Martin and then back at Chili. Martin's gaze remains fixed on Chili.\n\nThe scene concludes with Harry looking up to find Bo Catlett, impeccably dressed as always, standing with Bear, who is wearing a Hawaiian shirt.",
    "175": "In a swift sequence of events, a man referred to as The Black Guy has his ID folder open, ready for inspection. Meanwhile, Ray Bones exits through a different gate, a smile playing on his lips as he glances over his shoulder. Soon after, three men appear—two large figures in sunglasses flanking a smaller, older gentleman. The older man straightens up as Chili emerges from a stairwell and approaches him. Chili assesses the man, uncertain if he's genuinely naive or just making small talk. Nearby, a man known as The Bear watches intently but remains silent, only nodding and blinking occasionally.\n\nThe scene shifts to Harry, who is startled awake by the sound of his office door opening to reveal Ray Bones. Harry's hair is disheveled from sleep, and he nearly jolts out of his chair in surprise. Attempting to regain composure, Harry gestures to a red leather chair across the desk, inviting Bones to sit. As Bones takes a seat, Harry moves to open the blinds, but the setting sun fails to create the desired glare. Ray Bones points out the beautiful sunset, but Harry can only manage a smile, sensing that the situation is about to deteriorate.\n\nElsewhere, Bo Catlett is on the phone behind a large wooden desk. The Bear is seen half-doubled over, while three men in dark shades exit a car and enter a garage. Bo Catlett notices their arrival and hangs up the phone, rising to his feet as the men look into his office. One of the men, Mr. Escobar, the older and more intimidating of the group, steps inside. Bo Catlett finds himself wedged between two bodyguards in the back of a limo, facing Escobar. After a tense moment of study, Bo Catlett stiffens, shrugs, and offers a gleaming smile to Escobar, barely acknowledging the bodyguards.\n\nBack on the streets, Ronnie weaves in and out of traffic, giving passersby a stern look. Bo Catlett is on the phone in the car, while Ray Bones leans forward, having heard something familiar. Suddenly, Bones stands up and begins a brutal assault on Harry Zimm. Pulling a pair of black leather gloves from his pocket, Bones circles the desk, grabs Harry by the hair, and hurls him across the room. Harry crashes into a wall adorned with pictures, many of which fall and scatter around him.",
    "178": "Laurie stands anxiously by the telephone, then shrugs and walks away from the window, returning to Tommy and Lindsey who are seated on the couch. Elsewhere, a dimly lit room flickers with candlelight, casting shadows on sheets moving rhythmically. Empty beer cans scatter the floor, tracing a path from the door to the bed where a couple is intimately engaged. Suddenly, the lovemaking ceases, leaving the woman with disheveled hair and evident frustration. Bob abruptly seizes Lynda, pushing her onto the bed, and their passion resumes as the camera retreats through the bedroom doorway, revealing a dark figure, THE SHAPE, lurking and watching.\n\nEventually, Bob and Lynda reach their climax. Bob rolls off her, and Lynda lights a cigarette, handing it to Bob before lighting one for herself. Bob then leaves the room, a smile playing on Lynda's lips as she leans back onto the pillows. Meanwhile, Bob enters the kitchen through swinging doors, grabbing two beers from the refrigerator and gathering food and a can of peanuts from the cupboards. He pauses, looking around cautiously before peering outside to find the yard empty, save for the wind rustling the trees.\n\nSecuring the doors behind him, Bob freezes, his gaze fixed on them. He methodically checks behind each door, only to find THE SHAPE lurking behind the second, wearing a chilling rubber mask. With a swift and brutal lunge, THE SHAPE grabs Bob by the neck, lifting him off the floor despite his desperate struggles. Bob chokes, his feet dangling, as THE SHAPE slams him against the wall with inhuman strength. With a cold precision, THE SHAPE drives a butcher knife deep into Bob's chest, pinning him to the wall. The killer steps back, leaving Bob hanging lifelessly, his eyes forever locked in a stare of horror.\n\nBack in the bedroom, Lynda smokes languidly, hearing Bob enter but not bothering to look up. Standing in the doorway is THE SHAPE, whom Lynda initially mistakes for a harmless ghost. She playfully slides the sheets down her body, laughing at her own joke, but her laughter fades as the figure remains motionless. Lynda turns to face the ghost, unaware of the true nightmare that has entered her room.",
    "179": "In the flickering candlelight, Lynda begins her day, rising from bed, her natural beauty and sensuality on full display. She pads over to the phone, unaware of the ghostly figure standing ominously in the doorway. As she starts to dial, the ghost advances, moving steadily towards her. Meanwhile, Laurie sits on the couch, engrossed in her knitting. She moves to answer the ringing phone, just as Lynda holds her receiver to her ear. The ghost, now close behind Lynda, reaches out to grab her, but instead grabs the phone. He wraps the telephone cord around her neck, pulling it tight as she struggles, fighting for air and life. Laurie, on the other end, is met with strange squeals and rustling sounds, growing more disturbed as the eerie noises persist. Lynda desperately tries to scream and fight off her attacker, but the cord tightens around her neck, her body slowly going limp. In a final attempt, she reaches up and pulls on the ghost's sheet, revealing a grotesque Halloween mask. The ghost, his horrifying face now exposed, picks up the receiver and listens briefly before the line goes dead.\n\nLaurie, now deeply unsettled, hangs up the phone and moves to the window. She gazes out at the quiet, windswept street, her eyes landing on Bob's car parked in front of the Wallace house. Confused, she returns to the phone and dials Annie's number, but to no avail. Resigning herself to the silence, she climbs the stairs, finding Tommy and Lindsey fast asleep. After a moment of watchful tenderness, she closes the door, leaving them to their peaceful slumber.\n\nElsewhere, Dr. Loomis sits in silence, hidden behind a hedge, his eyes trained on the Myers house. A thought strikes him, and he advances down the empty residential street, his steps quickening as he recognizes a familiar station wagon parked nearby. He approaches the vehicle, his eyes drawn to the state emblem on its side. With newfound determination, he scans the street, his pace nearly a run as he searches for any sign of disturbance amidst the rows of houses.",
    "181": "Laurie is frozen in terror, gazing at her lifeless friend. As our eyes adjust to the dim light, a man's silhouette emerges from the shadows behind her. The figure becomes increasingly distinct, and Laurie abruptly moves away from her corner. The shape darts towards her, brandishing a knife. He slashes at her repeatedly, the blade eventually slicing across her arm, drawing blood. Laurie screams, spinning around in pain and fear. She stumbles backwards, hits the railing, and tumbles over the edge. The camera follows her descent as she crashes onto the floor, writhing in agony.\n\nThe masked figure, knife gleaming, appears at the top of the stairs and begins to descend. Laurie looks up, pulls herself off the floor, and retreats into the living room, the assailant quickening his pace behind her. She scrambles towards the kitchen, slamming the door shut and locking it just in time. Spotting the kitchen window, she limps towards the back door, desperately trying the handle, but it won't budge. A relentless pounding echoes from the other side of the kitchen door. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and the shape reaches in, groping for the lock. He grasps it, flicking it open with ease.\n\nWith a surge of adrenaline, Laurie forces the window open and drags herself out, tumbling onto the ground. She picks herself up and dashes across the backyard, the camera tracking her every move. Looking back, she trips over a fallen lamp but presses on, making her way into the neighbor's backyard. She pounds frantically on their back door, her heart racing. The back porch light flicks on, revealing an old woman in a nightgown approaching the door.",
    "182": "In the opening moments, an old woman casts a suspicious glance at Laurie before turning away from the door and retreating. Laurie, tentatively, extends her hand to touch the door. Meanwhile, Tommy, overcome with emotion, flees upstairs in tears. Laurie moves away from the door, advancing towards the telephone. She lifts the receiver, dials a number, and awaits a response. As she replaces the phone, she remains motionless. Cautiously, Laurie navigates around the couch, then slowly sinks to her knees beside it. Her hand grazes the knitting needles sticking out of her tote bag. Startled by their touch, she extracts one. Soft sobs escape her lips, her eyes wide with terror.\n\nAbruptly, a figure lunges from behind the couch, striking with a butcher knife. The blade sinks into the couch as Laurie recoils, instinctively raising her arm. In a swift motion, she seizes the knitting needle and stabs it into the assailant's neck. The figure stumbles backward, frantically clawing at the needle, then collapses onto the floor. Laurie remains frozen, staring at the now motionless form.\n\nThe camera follows Dr. Loomis as he traverses the street. Without warning, a police car screeches to a halt beside him, headlights glaring. Back at the house, the sinister figure looms, butcher knife poised. Two children scream in terror. Laurie hurriedly pushes them into the bathroom, shutting the door and locking herself out. She retreats from the door, circling around the bed as the menacing figure advances. Panicked, Laurie dashes into a closet, pulling the sliding doors shut and retreating into the dark interior.\n\nThe closet doors begin to buckle under the figure's relentless pounding. Desperate, Laurie grabs a wire hanger, unwinding it to form a makeshift weapon. The door gives way as the figure crashes through, pushing aside the clothes. Laurie, cornered, straightens the hanger and thrusts it into the figure's eye as he leans in. He recoils, dropping the butcher knife. Seizing her chance, Laurie grasps the knife and plunges it deep into the figure's midsection.",
    "177": "The camera's gaze shifts from a Jack-O-Lantern to a window, peering inside where a boyfriend surprises a pretty, 18-year-old sister, making her giggle as he enters the room wearing a Halloween mask and costume. He playfully reveals himself to be a handsome young man, and they share a passionate kiss. The voyeuristic viewpoint abruptly retreats from the window, pacing anxiously before darting to the side of the house and entering through a door. It navigates silently through the house to the kitchen, where a large butcher knife is retrieved from a drawer.\n\nMeanwhile, the boyfriend exits the bedroom, dressing himself. The intruder, now wearing the discarded Halloween mask, advances down the hall and peers into the bedroom. The sister, still nude, sits brushing her hair. Sensing someone, she turns and stares in disbelief, hurriedly covering herself. A swift and brutal attack ensues; the masked figure stabs her repeatedly with the butcher knife, the sister's screams echoing as she futilely defends herself before collapsing.\n\nThe assailant flees the room and races out of the house, darting up the street in a panic. The camera follows in a frantic chase, eventually halting in front of a neighbor's house, where a set of parents are exiting. The father removes the Halloween mask, revealing a calm and composed 6-year-old boy named Michael beneath, his eyes bright and a quiet smile on his face.",
    "184": "In a quiet classroom, a teacher's monotonous voice drones on as the camera focuses on Laurie, who is barely paying attention, engrossed in doodling in her notebook. Her gaze drifts towards the window, and she finds herself staring dreamily outside. Through the window, she sees a street and a station wagon parked along the sidewalk. Behind the vehicle stands the ominous shape of a man. Laurie turns away briefly, but something pulls her attention back to the window. This time, both the shape and the station wagon are gone. She turns back to her notebook, trying to shake off the strange feeling.\n\nMeanwhile, at a small, closed-down gas station by the highway, a car is parked, and the camera slowly tracks over to a phone booth where Loomis is deep in conversation on the telephone.\n\nBack at the high school, Annie emerges from the side doors, calling out to Laurie and Lynda. The girls stop and wait for her. Suddenly, Laurie pauses and looks back towards the school, her eyes scanning down the street. The station wagon slowly moves up the street towards them, but the shape behind the windshield is not visible. Laurie's eyes lock onto the wagon as it passes, and for a brief moment, she sees a strange, pale face staring back at her. The wagon accelerates and whizzes past them, then abruptly stops up the street, sitting there ominously before taking off and disappearing around a corner.\n\nThe girls resume their walk, eventually stopping in front of Lynda's modest suburban home. Lynda heads into her house, leaving Annie and Laurie to continue down the street. As they walk, the camera moves in to a close shot of Laurie's face, her eyes fixed ahead. Partially hidden in the shadows of a bush lining the sidewalk, the shape of a man is watching them, almost blending in with the dark foliage. In an instant, the shape vanishes, leaving only the bushes. Annie, unfazed, walks over and kicks the bushes hard. Laurie, more cautious, stands several feet away before slowly approaching to stare at the bush.\n\nThe scene captures the eerie atmosphere and Laurie's growing unease, setting the stage for the events to come.",
    "188": "Annie is startled by the growling of a dog and turns to Lindsey, who is in the living room. Outside, a mysterious shape is seen near the house, with Lester's legs kicking and struggling in mid-air as the shape strangles the dog. The dog's legs eventually stop moving and dangle lifelessly. Meanwhile, Laurie and Tommy are watching a horror movie marathon on TV. Laurie takes Tommy's hand, and they walk into the kitchen.\n\nAnnie, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed, walks through the passageway to the laundry room. The wind blows her robe open and creaks the door ajar. She enters the dark laundry room, briefly sees the light switch, but the wind blows the door shut. Annie pauses, then searches for the light switch. She turns toward the slightly open door and sees the outline of a figure standing there. The wind blows the door open wider, revealing the shape more clearly. Annie steps back inside and starts the washing machine, but a gust of wind slams the door shut. She rushes to the door, trying desperately to open it.\n\nLindsey Wallace, an 8-year-old with a pretty face, is watching the horror marathon at top volume on TV, ignoring the ringing phone. Annie glances at the window above the washing machine and sees the shape looking in, but it vanishes. She climbs onto the washing machine and tries to escape through the window but gets stuck. Lindsey finally pulls Annie back inside, helping her onto the dryer.\n\nAs they walk back into the house, the phone rings again. Lindsey races to answer it but sets the receiver down and leaves the kitchen. Annie, giving Lindsey a stern look, picks up the phone.

As he reaches for the doorknob, his fear becomes palpable. Suddenly, his focus shifts back to his friend Lonnie, who is paralyzed with terror, staring at a hedge that seems to speak. In a flash, Lonnie flees the porch, racing back to his friends, and together they dash down the street, panicked. Loomis, hidden behind the hedge, watches them retreat, a smirk playing on his lips. Unexpectedly, two hands grasp Loomis' shoulders from behind, making him jump and turn to find Brackett standing there. Without a word, Brackett turns and walks back towards the street.\n\nMeanwhile, a car pulls up in front of the house, its lights flicking off as laughter spills out from within. Bob Simms, a handsome 17-year-old, pops open a beer can, while Lynda eagerly drinks hers. With all the car lights out, Bob opens the door, and they tumble onto the ground, beer sloshing onto the front seat. They embrace, Lynda giggling as Bob lifts her up and carries her to the front door. Lynda's foot inadvertently kicks the door open as they arrive. They pause briefly before entering the seemingly empty house, the living room shrouded in darkness.\n\nLynda and Bob begin to turn on the lights, illuminating their path as they move to the couch. They share a passionate kiss, oblivious to the shadowy figure of a man watching them from the stairway. As the house plunges back into darkness, an eerie orange glow begins to float through the room. It's Laurie, carrying a jack-o'-lantern, followed by Lindsey and Tommy making spooky noises. They parade through the house, ending at the front window where Laurie places the glowing pumpkin.\n\nLooking out the window, Laurie spots Bob's car parked at the Wallace's residence. She sighs and takes a seat on the couch, Lindsey and Tommy snuggling up beside her. Later, Laurie gets up to answer the phone.

George, anxiously fumbling, drops his cigar onto his lap, hurriedly brushing away the smoldering sparks. As the two men shake hands, a wave of repulsion washes over George. Potter's hand feels cold and clammy, like a dead fish, cementing George's resolve to never align with such a man. With a shudder, George releases Potter's hand and studies his face intently. Suddenly, he turns and yells at the stone-faced goon standing by Potter's wheelchair. As he storms out of the office, George shouts at Potter's secretary in the adjacent room.\n\nLater, George enters a humbly furnished room containing little more than a simple bed, a couple of chairs, and a dresser. Mary sleeps peacefully in the bed, oblivious to George's tumultuous thoughts—a whirlwind of memories and emotions from his past. He removes his hat and coat, approaches the dresser, and gazes at his reflection in the mirror. His attention drifts to a familiar sketch hung nearby: a drawing of himself lassoing the moon, a scene reminiscent of Mary's living room.\n\nMary awakens and begins to sing their special song softly. Drawn to her, George sits down on the edge of the bed, and she greets him with a happy nod.

Dressed in old-fashioned winter underwear, he sips hot coffee, preoccupied by his near suicide and unsolved problems, ignoring Clarence and the suspicious tollkeeper.\n\nAcross the room, Clarence is putting on his undershirt, which is a ludicrous seventeenth-century garment resembling a baby’s nightshirt, with embroidered cuffs and collar, gathered at the neck with a drawstring. The tollkeeper, seated against the wall, eyes them with obvious suspicion. Clarence notices the tollkeeper’s incredulous stare at his garment, which falls below his knees. Attempting to spit, the tollkeeper is repeatedly stopped by Clarence’s amazing actions and words. Throughout the scene, Clarence’s every move leaves George and the tollkeeper awestruck.\n\nGeorge looks up surprised, his hand going to his mouth. The tollkeeper’s chair slips out from under him with a crash, and he rises, making his way warily out the door, clearly intending to call the nearest cop. George rubs his head, trying to clear his mind, and looks up at Clarence, who seems not to be getting far with him. Pacing thoughtfully, Clarence speaks, and suddenly, the snow stops falling outside, replaced by a strong wind that blows open the door to the shack. Clarence dashes to close it.\n\nAs Clarence speaks, George cocks his head curiously, favoring his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than in Clarence's words. He feels his ear, then his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut. Thoroughly confused, George touches the clothes on the line.

The once cheerful Italian atmosphere has vanished, replaced by a rough, hard-drinking honky-tonk with bare tables and a tougher crowd.\n\nGeorge and Clarence enter and approach the bar, prompting two patrons to leave. Behind the counter stands Nick, the bartender. Leaning in, Nick threateningly raises his left fist to Clarence, who is taken aback by this aggressive behavior. Nick turns to prepare their drinks, his suspicion piqued by their conversation. He abruptly stops pouring, holding the bottle mid-air as George looks up at him. Nick slams the bottle onto the counter, drawing attention to a disheveled figure—Gower, the druggist, now a broken-down panhandler with weak, watery eyes.\n\nDisbelieving his own eyes, Nick seizes a seltzer bottle and squirts Gower in the face, inciting brutal laughter from the crowd. Gower manages a weak smile as soda drips down his face. Horrified, George leaps up to aid Gower, but the bouncers swiftly eject the old man. Returning to the bar, George is soon thrown out into the snowy street alongside Clarence.\n\nThe camera lingers on George and Clarence, lying bewildered in the snow, before capturing George's glimpse of the neon sign overhead.

Among them are Dr. Campbell, who chairs the meeting, Uncle Billy, George, and the formidable Henry F. Potter, accompanied by his aide. Reports and folders are laid out before each director, indicating a session of intense discussion and review. Dr. Campbell rises, commanding the room's attention, as George and Uncle Billy begin to gather their papers, preparing to leave.

With a WHOOOOSH, the crowd disperses as the cross plummets toward Big Dan Teague, who stands frozen, gazing upward. The cross crashes down, engulfing Big Dan in a storm of sparks and embers.\n\nLater, a car pulls up in front of a lively town hall, where party sounds spill out. Pappy O'Daniel steps out of the vehicle, accompanied by Eckard, Spivey, and Junior. Delmar broods silently, while Everett is visibly shocked by the scene. As headlights scan the area, the men retreat into an alley to avoid a passing car. This vehicle stops at the banquet hall, and Homer Stokes emerges with his midget companion. The midget discards his balled-up white hood into the car, and both men adjust their suitcoats before ascending the stairs, the midget hopping awkwardly to keep pace with Stokes's brisk stride.\n\nMeanwhile, Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy sneak in through the back door, their blackface removed but now sporting clumsily attached long gray beards as disguises. Each carries a musical-instrument case as they navigate past the bustling kitchen staff. In the banquet hall, Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side at the head table, flanked by the Wharvey gals, their backs to the stage where the four bearded band members take their positions. Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair, leaning in to murmur confidentially, while Waldrip listens intently, frowning.\n\nSuddenly, Waldrip bursts out, shaking her head vigorously and looking down at her plate as Everett pleads to her back. The band begins performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow,' sparking a massive reaction from the crowd. Everett, still trying to catch Penny's attention, is stunned by the ovation. The band members exchange bemused looks but quickly lean into the song with renewed energy. Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing dance, driving the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nStokes watches the band, his expression troubled. The crowd's attention shifts to him, their faces stony. Undeterred, Stokes continues his speech, only to be pelted with foodstuffs, including a tomato. Shielding himself with one arm, he bellows into the microphone, his voice nearly drowned out by the music. An old man in overalls and his wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening intently to the distant, tinny voice. They exchange wordless glances before turning back to the crystal set. Back at the banquet hall, a disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug, leaving Stokes to mouth inaudible words as his midget looks on apprehensively.",
    "219": "In a quiet moment, four men huddle around a vintage box radio, each absorbed in their own activities. Wash is engrossed in whittling, Everett meticulously styles his hair with pomade, Pete picks at his teeth with a toothpick, and Delmar lazily waves his hand in rhythm with the music. Everett briefly interrupts the scene as he clears his throat and secures the lid on the pomade jar. Later, they find themselves asleep in a hayloft, Everett's hair carefully preserved under a hairnet.\n\nSuddenly, a spotlight sweeps across the hayloft ceiling, accompanied by a booming voice. The men stir awake, only to discover a lawman surrounded by armed deputies below. Beside him stands an impassive sheriff, his mirrored sunglasses reflecting the scene, with a bloodhound by his side. Pete screams down in terror as a burst of tommy gun fire forces them to take cover. Enraged, Pete retaliates by throwing a flaming torch down at the deputies, but it lands harmlessly in the straw.\n\nThe situation escalates as gunfire erupts, bullets ricocheting and setting the scene ablaze. The men scramble into a nearby vehicle, the young driver using wood blocks strapped to his feet to reach the pedals and a catalog to see over the dashboard. With a roar, the car speeds towards the far wall, crashing through it in a dramatic escape.\n\nThe young boy, now alone, walks unsteadily down the empty road, the wood blocks still on his feet. He turns and hollers, only to have Pete enter the frame and throw a dirt clod at him, yelling in frustration. The scene shifts to the men stopped by the roadside, Everett and Delmar inspecting the engine under the propped-open hood. Inside a general store, a small tin is pushed across the counter, leaving Everett stunned as he picks it up.\n\nLater, on a wooded hillside, the men sit around a small fire, roasting a creature on a spit. Everett joins them, clearly disheartened, and begins to comb his hair with the last of his pomade. In a gesture of gratitude or consolation, he tosses a gold watch to Pete, who examines it with confusion before reading the inscription inside.",
    "221": "In a flurry of activity, Pappy breezes past Junior, who attempts to engage him in conversation. Pappy playfully swats the young man with his hat before turning his attention to the radio building, where singers dressed in mock hillbilly attire emerge from a second car, carrying an assortment of musical instrument cases. Meanwhile, Tommy sits nearby, strumming and singing a slow, mournful blues tune.\n\nElsewhere, three convicts huddle together, clutching coffee cups as they stare into a crackling fire. One of them, Pete, absently swirls his coffee while lost in thought, murmuring softly to himself. Suddenly, all three men freeze, their senses on high alert. Pete hurriedly shovels dirt onto the fire, extinguishing it, as Delmar and Everett cautiously peer over a low ridge.\n\nTheir gaze falls upon a solitary barn, with their getaway car parked alongside. Surrounding the barn are various police vehicles, armed men taking aim at the building, some crouching behind their cars for cover. A man with a bullhorn barks orders towards the distant barn. The convicts' eyes widen as they spot the sheriff standing stoically beside the man with the bullhorn, restraining a bloodhound eager to give chase.\n\nThe three men hastily shuffle down the dusty road, their plans disrupted by the sound of an approaching speeding car. It careens around the corner on two wheels before crashing back onto all four, dollar bills flying out of its windows like confetti. The car screeches to a halt in front of the three men, Delmar hopefully gesturing for a ride. The driver, a youthful man in a sharp suit with a cherubic face, leans over to address them through the passenger window. Delmar, captivated by the fluttering money, plucks a bill from the air, examining it with childlike wonder before grabbing another.\n\nClimbing into the car, the three men speed off just as the sound of sirens grows louder. The driver steals a glance at his rearview mirror, reaching inside his coat. He pauses, taking stock of his passengers, as Delmar delightedly watches the paper currency dance within the car. Everett slides over in surprise as Delmar casually steps onto the running board, now fully outside and facing their pursuers. George Nelson, with one hand gripping the car roof, waves to Delmar with the other before unleashing a barrage of bullets at the pursuit vehicles. Nelson fires wildly as the chase intensifies, the pursuit cars gaining and returning fire in a thunderous crescendo.",
    "223": "In the opening scene, a bird's-eye view reveals Everett, Pete, and Delmar huddled beneath the eave of a barn, seeking refuge from the pouring rain. Clutching their coats tightly around their necks, they gaze dejectedly at the miserable weather. The trio then treks along a elevated red dirt road, winding through a bayou, and later finds themselves gathered around a campfire. Everett perches on a stump, dramatically spinning a ghost story while Pete and Delmar watch him, enthralled and wide-eyed.\n\nTheir journey continues as they pass a cotton field, its burst pods dotting the landscape. Meanwhile, elsewhere, a sad-faced woman in a calico dress speaks to a clerk, her expression crestfallen with disappointment.\n\nSuddenly, a car pulls up, and before it even stops, Pete flings open the door and tumbles down the bank towards the river. Everett and Delmar follow at a more leisurely pace, with Everett chuckling at Pete's eagerness. An ethereal singing fills the air, coming from three beautiful women washing clothes in the stream. Their voices carry an otherworldly languor, and Pete is immediately smitten, awkwardly smiling and staring intensely at them. The women smile back but do not respond to his attempts at conversation, continuing their singing and laundry. One of them offers Everett a jug marked with three Xes.\n\nDelmar's attention, however, is drawn to a peculiar sight: a spot on a shirt in the laundry pile rhythmically rising and falling. Everett joins him to inspect the mystery, and to their astonishment, a large yellow toad emerges from under the collar. Delmar lets out a keening sound, bewildering Everett. The toad hops away, but Delmar scoops it up and cradles it in his lap, whimpering and petting it as the creature croaks. Everett watches, squinting and shaking his head in disbelief.\n\nLater, the scene shifts to a formally set table with linen, where Delmar and Everett sit engrossed in a serious conversation, a shoebox resting between them. Everett points a knife at the shoebox to emphasize his words. Unnoticed by them, a broad-shouldered man in a cream-colored suit and powder-blue collar shirt sits nearby, his cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue trim revealed as he turns to look intently at the pair. He senses something amiss and looks up from his large plate of steak and eggs, cocking his head before turning back to observe Everett and Delmar arguing in the distance. A waitress approaches to take his order, but his focus remains on the two men.",
    "225": "In the opening scene, a man climbs into a car that splutters and chugs before rumbling down the road. Meanwhile, Delmar, grief-stricken, stumbles toward the lifeless body of a frog, tears streaming down his face. The narrative then shifts to a grim scenario where a man, Pete, is brutally interrogated. His arms are stretched and bound to a tree branch, and his captor brandishes a menacing bullwhip. Each crack of the whip elicits a scream of agony. Suddenly, a third figure, Cooley, the sheriff known for his mirrored sunglasses, steps into the torchlight, accompanied by a drooling hound. The two torturers step back, acknowledging Cooley's presence. As rain begins to fall, Cooley looks up, then down at Pete, and finally shrugs, his gaze drifting off.\n\nA rope is tossed up into the darkness, disappearing briefly before dropping back down, a noose dangling at its end. The henchmen secure the noose around Pete's neck. Delmar, watching in disbelief, shakes his head in denial. In the distance, the sound of picks clanging and male voices chanting can be heard. Everett, his eyes hollow, tries to convince both Delmar and himself of something, his voice fading as he looks out at the road. Their journey reveals a line of chained prisoners in striped uniforms and duck-billed caps, laboring with pickaxes and shovels. Everett's gaze is drawn to the last man in line, who stares back until the heat and dust obscure him from view. Everett blinks, shakes his head as if to clear it, and the truck rumbles on.\n\nThe scene transitions to a stage adorned with bunting, where a thin man with round, rimless glasses addresses a crowd of country folk. Identified as 'Homer Stokes, Friend of the Little Man,' he waves a broom overhead. Beside him, a midget in overalls mimics his actions with a smaller broom, beaming amid the cheers. Three girls in gingham dresses join them, the oldest around ten years old. Everett pushes through the crowd toward the stage, with a puzzled Delmar in tow. A man in a straw boater approaches them, and Everett, catching a scent, takes a wild swing at him. The man, Waldrip, dodges and adopts a boxing stance, landing precise punches on Everett's nose. The altercation ends with Everett being thrown out, belly flopping into the dusty street.",
    "226": "In the dim, quiet theater, romantic music tinny played as Delmar and Everett watched the screen, Everett slouched and seething. The meager audience shifted restlessly in their seats. Suddenly, a man wielding a shotgun entered, striding halfway down the aisle to stand sentinel behind Delmar and Everett. He surveyed the theater, then blew a sharp whistle. On cue, the rear doors swung open, and a line of chained men double-timed inside, filling the rows with a cacophony of clanking metal. They stood silent, awaiting the next command.\n\nThe initial guard and his two companions scrutinized the theater once more before another whistle pierced the air, prompting the chained men to sit. A final whistle signaled the movie to resume. A hushed whisper from behind caught Everett and Delmar's attention. Everett's jaw dropped, his face a mask of disbelief as he gaped at the figure behind them. Delmar stared too, finally acknowledging Pete's presence. Pete squinted, trying to decipher Delmar's exaggerated whispers, but only mirrored the confusion.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Governor's Mansion, Pappy O'Daniel enjoyed an evening smoke and sip of bourbon. Back in the theater, Everett emerged from his hiding spot, face blackened, swaying as if on a boat. He wielded a large, short-nosed pincering tool, locking it onto Pete's chain. With a lever of the arms, Pete's hand was freed, though Pete remained motionless, eyes burning into Everett's. Tears began to stream down Pete's face as he grappled with his newfound freedom, embracing a stunned Delmar and a noticeably uncomfortable Everett.\n\nPete's joy quickly turned to shock as he and Delmar stared at Everett. Delmar brightened, but Pete lunged, tackling Everett. They tumbled through the brush, stopping abruptly at the edge of a clearing. Before them, a vast field where men in bedsheets marched in formation, a huge fiery cross illuminating the night. Pete and Everett hastily retreated, pushing through the bushes with Delmar in tow.",
    "229": "In the grim reality of a labor camp, Władysław Szpilman meticulously records each tool taken by the workers, managing the ledger with careful precision. Suddenly, a worker peers into the storage area. Meanwhile, Jewish laborers gather on the site in disorderly lines as an SS Captain enters, his jovial demeanor starkly contrasting the bleak environment. The captain climbs onto scaffolding, grinning broadly while surveying the workers who remain stone-faced. Szpilman exchanges a meaningful glance with Majorek, a fellow worker. The captain, trying to elicit a reaction, rubs his thumb and forefinger suggestively, but the workers remain impassive, causing his smile to fade.\n\nWinter's harsh cold sets in as Majorek pulls a barrow loaded with five sacks across the site, approaching Szpilman. Majorek, initially alert, takes a piece of paper from Szpilman without a word and then retreats back to his makeshift bed. Szpilman returns to his bunk, having stashed the sacks of potatoes in a corner. As he kneels to untie the smallest sack, a sound startles him. An SS Lieutenant enters, nursing a bleeding finger. Szpilman hurriedly fetches a first aid kit, offering a plaster to the Lieutenant.\n\nThe lieutenant's eyes fall on the sacks. Terrified, Szpilman fumbles with the string, unable to untie it. Impatient, the lieutenant pushes Szpilman aside, draws a dagger, and slices the string open. He withdraws a handful of yellow beans, then oatmeal, which he hurls in Szpilman's face before kicking him brutally and storming off. Left alone, Szpilman recovers his breath and quickly rummages through the sack, discovering a pistol and ammunition hidden within. He conceals them under his clothes, the cold biting deeper into his bones.\n\nThe Jewish workers, carrying their meager rations of potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates under the watchful eyes of Polish policemen. One policeman takes a swig of vodka and confronts Szpilman, his glassy eyes piercing through him. Szpilman, terrified, tries to conceal his hidden package. In a moment of peril, the policeman, Zick-Zack, grabs Szpilman by the collar, finding amusement in the situation. The column of workers begins to move again, and from the rear, a solitary voice rings out, singing, \"Children of Warsaw will go to fight!\" It's Majorek, his voice strong and defiant. Szpilman smiles, and Majorek nods in acknowledgment. One by one, the other workers join in, their voices rising in unison as they march on, singing with renewed spirit.\n\nLater, Szpilman finds solace in a steaming bath, his eyes closed as if in a trance, a brief respite from the harsh realities of his world.",
    "231": "In the gripping sequence, Gebczynski approaches Szpilman from behind, swiftly shutting the cupboard before making a beeline for the front door. Pausing momentarily, Gebczynski hands Szpilman a small piece of paper, shakes his hand firmly, and then departs hastily. Left alone, Szpilman stands momentarily disoriented. Recovering, he removes his shoe and tucks the scrap of paper inside it. His gaze falls upon the divan bed. Moving towards it, he slips off his other shoe and reclines, testing the divan's comfort with his entire body. A beatific smile spreads across his face as he closes his eyes, drifting instantly into a deep sleep.\n\nSzpilman remains fast asleep until voices stir him awake. Opening his eyes, he is briefly confused about his whereabouts. The voices, emanating from the neighboring flat, pique his curiosity. Rising, he inches closer to the wall, pressing his ear against it to listen intently. Intrigued and enjoying the moment, Szpilman hears the sound of a piano being played with great emotion but numerous wrong notes. The music halts abruptly, followed by the slamming of a door.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, Szpilman receives a parcel from Janina. Retreating to the small kitchen, he unpacks its contents while Janina looks out the window, her attention drawn to the horrifying sight outside. The building is ablaze, corpses are scattered on the pavement, and German soldiers stand around, chatting and laughing. A group of Jewish fighters are lined up and executed mercilessly. The blazing sun casts a harsh light on the burned-out ghetto buildings, now empty and desolate. Autumn leaves swirl in the wind, and as Szpilman gazes out, the scene transitions to a snowy landscape, with ice forming on the windows.\n\nThe sound of a key turning in the door alerts Szpilman. Gebczynski enters, visibly distraught, and whispers hurriedly. Lighting a cigarette, Gebczynski smokes quickly before exiting. Szpilman listens to his footsteps echoing down the stairs. Spotting the cigarette stub, Szpilman picks it up, lights it, and takes a few awkward puffs, coughing as he smokes. The sound of a car engine and screeching brakes abruptly tenses him. German voices shout commands, their heavy footsteps thundering up the stairs.\n\nSzpilman rushes to the window, opening it and positioning a chair sideways to create a makeshift step. Contemplating his escape, he leans against the wall near the door, waiting anxiously. The slamming of doors, German shouts, and a scream pierce the air. Bracing himself, Szpilman prepares to jump. Footsteps descend the stairs, and a door slams shut. Cautiously, Szpilman returns to the window, looking out to see SS men forcefully escorting two prisoners into a car, which then speeds away, leaving the street empty.\n\nThe snow falls silently, accompanied by a howling wind. Szpilman lies on the divan, his appearance disheveled—unshaven, with filthy and long hair. With considerable effort, he manages to rise, his determination palpable in the face of adversity.",
    "227": "In the throes of a chaotic crowd, a man turns to find a remarkably beautiful young woman gazing at him with adoring eyes as they are jostled about. His face lights up with instant infatuation. Suddenly, Jurek intervenes, pushing himself between them to take the young woman, Dorota, by the arm. With a firm grip, Jurek drags Dorota down the stairs, forcing her through the dense crowd. Caught in the flow, the man is swept along into the lobby, where chaos and debris surround them.\n\nAmidst the tumult, Władysław Szpilman struggles to reach the main door, but another bomb detonates nearby, casting a thick veil of dust and debris over everyone, obscuring his vision.\n\nEarlier, in the comfort of their elegant bourgeois apartment filled with books, paintings, and a grand piano, the Szpilman family is in a state of panic. They rush in and out of rooms, hastily packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk. The living room, adorned with silver platters and candlesticks, serves as the backdrop for their frantic activity. Szpilman sits by the radio, desperately trying to tune into a station, while his father clutches a silver-framed photograph, crossing the room to his wife. The mother, barely containing her tears, rushes into the kitchen just as Szpilman enters the apartment, bewildered by the chaos.\n\nThe mother dashes back out, searching for something amidst the bustle. The rest of the family continues to pack frenetically. Gathering around, Henryk hits the radio set in frustration. The father pours liqueur into glasses as the family gathers around the dining table, having just finished a meal. The table is laden with the remnants of dinner. They clink glasses and drink, trying to find solace in the shared moment.\n\nOutside, a column of German soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, marches into view. Szpilman, Henryk, and their father stand among the onlookers on the ruined street, watching expressionlessly as the Germans parade past. The buildings around them lie in ruins, with smoke still rising from the destruction.\n\nBack in the apartment, Regina examines the window, opening and closing it, feeling the frame with her fingers. At the other end of the room, the father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is lost in thought, while Szpilman fiddles with his father's violin. The apartment is now sparsely furnished, the silverware gone. The family stares at the worn table, its veneer peeling to reveal bare wood beneath. They begin to hide their valuables, preparing for the worst.\n\nLater, Szpilman waits anxiously by a public telephone, hoping for someone to answer his call. He and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street marred by bombed-out buildings and rubble. She glances at him admiringly, almost lovingly, as they walk and talk. Smiling, touched by her attention, Szpilman feels a connection growing between them. She blushes, embarrassed by her own feelings, and begins to laugh. Their laughter becomes contagious, and they find themselves holding onto each other, almost helpless with joy. Amidst their shared laughter, Szpilman takes Dorota's hand and kisses it tenderly.\n\nBack at the apartment, the family gathers around the table once again, this time listening intently as the father reads from the newspaper, the gravity of their situation weighing heavily on their minds.",
    "237": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film opens with a man smiling and hastening to reunite with his family, but not before he takes a final glance back, realizing Dorota has vanished from sight as the procession marches on. The Szpilmans are silently unpacking their belongings in their new third-floor apartment, consisting of a living room and a kitchen. The father pauses briefly to reflect on their situation before the family gathers at the window. Gazing out, they notice men constructing a wall further along the street, with slush blanketing the ground below.\n\nThe scene outside bustles with activity. Vendors peddle shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, and food. A woman offers cakes beneath a makeshift barbed-wire cover. Amidst the noise and commotion, Henryk, now slightly disheveled, attempts to sell books from a basket at his feet. Szpilman, also worn down, navigates the crowd and joins Henryk. Together, they lift the book basket and begin to walk, encountering beggars and hungry children along the way.\n\nAbruptly, an eccentrically dressed woman adorned with bright rouge and a feathered hat blocks their path. She soon wanders off, and Szpilman and Henryk press on. A street band stirs to life, playing a waltz. German soldiers and Jewish policemen forcefully clear an area, pushing Jews aside, including Szpilman and Henryk. More soldiers corral unwilling couples to dance to the band's music—a grotesque spectacle that amuses some soldiers, with one almost hysterical with laughter. The dancing is frenzied; a soldier kicks a cripple who falters. A whistle blows, traffic halts, and people flood across the opened barrier in both directions.\n\nSzpilman and Henryk enter their apartment and find a peculiar sight: their family seated with Yitzchak Heller, a red-haired man in uniform with a Hitler mustache. Heller acknowledges the brothers with a nod, leading to an awkward silence. Unexpectedly, Benek gestures towards a customer, who desperately signals Szpilman to stop playing his music.",
    "238": "In a bustling scene, a friend observes a customer meticulously dropping coins onto a marble surface, one by one. The customer leans in, listening intently to the sound each coin makes. He discards a few but smiles and keeps those that produce a pure tone. Meanwhile, Szpilman, a pianist, exchanges flirtatious glances with an attractive woman across the room. Satisfied with his selections, the customer nods appreciatively to Szpilman, who resumes playing the piano.\n\nSzpilman then ventures out, passing by emaciated children and beggars strewn along the sidewalk. He steps over lifeless bodies, navigating a narrow street divided by a towering wall. Buildings line one side, while the imposing wall dominates the other. As he walks, a piercing whistle echoes from the Aryan side of the wall. Szpilman pauses as two women emerge from a doorway, looking up expectantly. Packages are tossed over the wall, which the women quickly grab before disappearing.\n\nContinuing his journey, Szpilman witnesses a child wriggling through a small hole at ground level. The child pulls a package through and dashes off. Moments later, Szpilman hears a noise and turns back to see another child stuck in the same hole. Angry German voices bark from the other side, and Szpilman rushes to help, pulling with all his might, but the boy is firmly lodged. From the other side, the sound of a boot violently stamping on the boy echoes, and his screams of agony fill the air. Despite Szpilman's desperate efforts, the boy's cries weaken until he finally manages to pull him through, but it's too late—the boy lies lifeless. Szpilman hurriedly stands and rushes away.\n\nApproaching a shabby yard, Szpilman hears the steady hum of a mimeograph machine. Inside, a large, cheerful man with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth laughs and coughs while sorting through papers. The room is cluttered with old documents and junk, casting a dark and rundown atmosphere. The man's sons, Symche and Dolek, are busy operating the mimeograph machine and sorting the printed sheets. Mrs. Zyskind, holding a toddler, cooks at a small stove.\n\nA distinctive knock at the door startles Szpilman, but the cheerful man, Jehuda, beams with recognition. Symche opens the door, revealing a short, neat man named Majorek.",
    "239": "In the midst of a tense evening, a man abruptly stops, his eyes locking onto Szpilman. Szpilman responds with a nonchalant shrug. Their companion, Jehuda, finds something humorous, but his laughter quickly degenerates into a brutal coughing fit. The family is gathered around a small table, their mother serving soup from a saucepan, when the man laughs again, drawing the puzzled gazes of the others. Suddenly, their attention shifts as they rush to the windows, drawn by the abrupt arrival of a Gestapo vehicle screeching to a halt outside.\n\nHelmeted SS men, led by an NCO, spill out of the vehicle, prompting the Szpilmans to huddle at their open window, eyes wide with terror. Regina swiftly turns off the lights before joining them. From their vantage point, they watch as the SS men storm the building opposite, the harsh sound of jackboots echoing through the stairs. Lights flicker on floor by floor, revealing glimpses of the impending horror.\n\nDirectly across from them, a family—a businessman, his wife, three youths, and an elderly man in a wheelchair—sit frozen at their dining table as the SS men burst in, machine pistols ready. The NCO's gaze sweeps over their faces, and the family rises in panic, except for the old man who desperately tries but fails to stand from his wheelchair. Without a moment's hesitation, the SS men seize the chair, carrying the old man onto the balcony.\n\nThe Szpilmans watch in horror as the old man is thrown over the balcony, his body seeming to hang in the air for a second before plummeting out of sight with a sickening thud. The wheelchair clatters down after him, the sound echoing through the street. Mother screams, her sobs echoing as Father recoils, Halina and Regina desperately trying to comfort their parents.\n\nChaos erupts as shots ring out, doors slam, and screams fill the air. From another window, the Szpilmans witness the SS men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building. People watch from their windows, trying not to be seen. The headlights of the SS vehicle illuminate the prisoners, who start to run. Machine gun fire from the vehicle mows them down, their bodies lifting into the air before falling dead. One man makes a desperate escape, running back into the shadows, his silhouette disappearing from sight for a moment as he puts distance between himself and the SS men.",

Maynard, wielding a fire extinguisher, shotgun, and Marsellus's .45, revives them, then leaves his captives to absorb their dire situation.\n\n**Panic grips Butch and Marsellus** as they survey the room, their mutual animosity replaced by shared terror. Maynard returns with his brother, Zed, who studies the captives intently. **Maynard then reveals a hidden chamber**, from which he retrieves a leashed figure in full bondage gear—**the Gimp**. Zed takes a seat in front of the prisoners, assuming control of the Gimp's leash as Maynard steps back. **Paralyzed with fear**, Butch and Marsellus watch as the Gimp kneels before them, its masked gaze shifting between the two captives.",
    "257": "In the opening moments, a man pulls into the parking lot of a convenience store, leaving his car engine running as he hastily exits the vehicle. Inside the store, a hand swiftly grabs a package of pantyhose from a rack, followed by a large carton of disposable diapers from a shelf. Meanwhile, a young cashier with acne and a 7-Eleven cap is engrossed in a dirty magazine but looks up in horror as he sees someone approaching. The man, now identified as Hi, advances towards the check-out counter, armed with a gun and carrying the carton of Huggies, his face distorted by a stocking pulled over his head. The cashier discreetly presses a silent alarm beneath the counter.\n\nElsewhere, Ed is calmly reading a large picture book to Nathan Jr. She pauses, straining to hear a faint siren in the distance. Though she tries to continue reading, her voice trails off as the siren grows louder and more insistent, clearly approaching their location. Ed looks around anxiously, and through the semi-reflective glass of the store, two figures can be seen at the check-out counter, one threateningly pointing something at the other.\n\nAs the siren's wail intensifies, Ed mutters under her breath and quickly exits the car. Inside the store, Hi is now forcing the cashier to stuff bills into a grocery bag. Ed circles the front of the car, her shout muffled through the glass, catching Hi's attention. He turns briefly to the cashier, but Ed is already slipping into the driver's seat. The siren blares loudly as she slams the car door shut and speeds out of the parking lot.\n\nA police car crests a hill, its siren blaring as it comes into view. Hi bursts out of the store, still wearing the stocking and clutching the carton of Huggies, desperately calling after his departing car. Bewildered, he looks around the parking lot as the siren becomes deafening. Behind him, a bullet hole is visible in the store's plate-glass front. Inside, the young cashier takes aim with a massive .44 Magnum, using both hands to steady the weapon. A second bullet smacks through the glass, sending Hi running for his life.\n\nThe squad car screeches into the lot, and an officer tumbles out of the passenger side, hitting the pavement before quickly righting himself and adopting a half-kneeling shooting stance. The scene fades with the officer taking aim, leaving Hi's fate uncertain as the tense confrontation unfolds.",
    "262": "In the midst of a tense confrontation, Hi advances toward Evelle, his jaw set with determination. Suddenly, Gale intervenes, stepping between them. Hi, undeterred, snaps shut the chamber of his .38 revolver and exits the frame, his voice still audible as he continues speaking. Moments later, he re-enters the frame armed not just with the .38, but also with an automatic handgun. With practiced efficiency, he loads a clip into the automatic. Hi briefly leaves the frame again, the sound of his rummaging echoing offscreen, all the while maintaining his monologue.\n\nHe reappears, now with both handguns tucked into his belt and brandishing a menacing pump-action shotgun. The distinctive sound of the shotgun being primed—WHOOSH-CLACK—cuts through the air. The scene shifts dramatically to a serene desert landscape stretching out to the horizon, viewed from the front bumper of a moving car. The road races beneath the camera’s lens, and Gale is shown behind the wheel, his eyes fixed on the open expanse ahead. In the backseat, Evelle gently bounces Nathan Jr., a contemplative expression on his face as he occasionally glances down at the baby, shifting him in his lap. Gale notices Evelle’s beaming smile directed at him.\n\nThe focus shifts to a small mom-and-pop store where Evelle sets down a carton of diapers on the check-out counter. Facing him is the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man, perhaps the store’s proprietor. Evelle’s various baby purchases—diapers, baby food, and more—are piled high on the counter. The Cashier methodically rings up each item, while through the open door, a strip of the parking lot is visible.\n\nEvelle, browsing the impulse purchases near the register, takes a plastic-covered squirt gun and drops it on the counter. He then unhooks a bag of balloons, adding to his collection. Abruptly, Evelle pulls a gun from his belt. The Cashier, sensing danger, ducks down out of frame. Gale, hands now free, reaches for the back door as Evelle sorts through his purchases. Gale drives, looking around with a puzzled expression. The two men exchange a glance, their heads whipping around to check the back seat. A shared realization dawns on them, eyes widening in horror as they both look up at the car's roof.\n\nGale slows down, his foot coming off the accelerator, screaming as he watches something unfold. Choked up, he speaks in a low, unsteady voice. A somber mood settles over the car as both men stare wordlessly ahead at the road. Hi looks over at Ed, glum but attempting kindness, nodding to himself. This gesture quiets Hi. After a moment, Hi clears his throat.\n\nCutting to an entirely different scene, a huge, rumbling, rippling red ball fills the frame. The sound of footfalls on concrete steps announces Smalls’ arrival as he climbs a stoop, his silhouette stark against the blazing sun behind him. The telephoto lens flattens his figure against the sun, and heat waves ripple in the air, causing his form to waver slightly. The camera holds on this dramatic entry, setting the stage for the next sequence of events.",
    "264": "In a chaotic burst of emotion, Gale and Evelle, drenched in blue, scream in a mix of rage, fear, and confusion as blue dollar bills whirl around their car. Gale, driving blindly with the windshield coated in blue paint, swerves erratically. He desperately reaches forward to clear a spot on the windshield, revealing Hi and Ed's car parked sideways in the middle of the road. Hi stands defiantly with his scatter gun, while Ed holds a revolver. Ed rushes to Gale and Evelle's car, flinging open the back door in search of the baby, but finds only Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care book. Meanwhile, Evelle stumbles around, shocked and disbelieving at his blue-painted body.\n\nHi and Ed quickly climb into their car and speed away. Left behind, Nathan Jr. sits calmly in his car seat in the middle of the road in front of the bank. The camera zooms out to reveal the empty street beyond the baby, as the sound of return fire and screeching brakes pierces the air. A loud explosion follows, silencing the siren's wail and leaving the police car a flaming wreck. As the echo of the explosion fades, the deep rumble of an approaching engine grows louder. Lenny Smalls' motorcycle crests the hill, framed against the fire and smoke, heading directly toward the baby.\n\nFrom the opposite direction, the baby is seen sitting in the street as Lenny approaches rapidly from the background. In an extremely low and wide shot, the camera rushes toward the rear of Nathan Jr.'s car seat as Lenny's hand drops into the frame, ready to scoop it up. With a clank of chains, Lenny grabs the car seat and hooks it over his handlebars, roaring away with the baby secured.\n\nLenny then draws a shotgun from his back holster, levels it at the oncoming car, and fires, shattering the windshield. The bike banks into a hard turn, the baby on the handlebars in the foreground as the road rushes by. Shooting through the missing windshield, the camera captures the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt.",
    "266": "In a tender moment, Ed's hand rests on top of Hi's, which is then covered by Hi's other hand. Hi removes a ring from his own finger and places it on Ed's, symbolizing a deep connection between them. Meanwhile, a gruff janitor, referred to as the Mopping Con, has made his way to the foreground, observing Hi as he is escorted to his cell. Midway down the corridor, Hi nonchalantly gestures towards the floor, drawing the Mopping Con's attention as Hi continues on. The scene focuses tightly on Hi, his expression distant and thoughtful, as Moses' voice fades from the background.\n\nThe camera then reveals the underside of the top bunk, which suddenly flashes white, fading to show an image of Ed smiling behind her camera, softly superimposed on the bunk. Hi, clearly exhausted, turns his head to rest on the pillow, closing his eyes. Another flash illuminates him, even with his eyes shut.\n\nThe scene shifts to Hi being processed in a familiar booking room, accompanied by the same three officers. Ed is seen snapping a picture of another suspect against a hatched wall. Hi playfully gestures at the suspect as Ed, clad in a white bridal gown, nervously adjusts her dress in front of a mirror. She gazes earnestly into the camera, capturing the moment.\n\nBehind her, a congregation is seated, with the bride's side dressed in police uniforms and the groom's side in Hawaiian shirts. All eyes are on the camera, including the minister's. The focus shifts to the newlyweds, smiling first at the camera and then at each other, their profiles captured beautifully.\n\nIn a vast desert expanse, Hi is seen working a drill press, wearing goggles and sweat-stained overalls. Beside him stands Bud, a seasoned worker with a grimy face and goggles pushed up on his forehead. Hi's frustration is evident as he scowls at his paycheck, while a fat cashier grins behind a barred window.\n\nLater, Hi and Ed sit in lawn chairs in front of their trailer, both wearing sunglasses as they watch the setting sun. The scene is bathed in a warm yellow light that gradually turns amber as the sun dips lower. They follow the sun's slow descent until it disappears, leaving a neutral dusky light that eventually fades into darkness. Crickets chirp in the night as Ed marks off the last day on a calendar before a day circled in red. Hi returns home wearily after a long day at work, clutching his lunch pail. Ed excitedly rushes into the frame, leaping into his arms and covering him with kisses, their love evident in every gesture.",
    "273": "As the two men approach the couch, Ed tentatively speaks up, his gaze fixed on the baby. She wrinkles her nose apologetically, causing Gale, Evelle, and Hi to look up in dumbstruck silence. After a moment, she turns to Hi, then storms off, slamming the bedroom door and leaving an awkward silence. Gale leans in to Hi, his face etched with concern, and murmurs under his breath while Evelle stares at the ceiling. Later, Hi tiptoes into the bedroom where Ed lies facing the wall. He sits gently on the bed and smiles as he plays with the baby through the crib bars, the faint sound of the TV drifting in from the living room. Ed finally turns to face him, and they lock eyes.\n\nThe scene shifts suddenly. We look down at Hi sleeping in bed, and for a brief, startling moment, a wall of flames fills the screen, accompanied by a deafening roar. The faint National Anthem ends, replaced by the high-pitched whine of a test pattern. Suddenly, a massive low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring louder than the fire. The driver, a formidable leather-clad biker, charges through the scene, chains clanking ominously. The biker speeds along a desert highway, leaving a trail of fire, and reaches for two sawed-off shotguns strapped to his back.\n\nThe camera pulls back to reveal a jack-rabbit running in the foreground. The biker takes aim and fires, felling the rabbit with a crack of the shotgun. He then targets a lizard sunning itself on a rock, blowing it away with another shot. As the biker roars down the empty desert road, a lone flower blooms in the foreground, only to be consumed by flames as the biker speeds past. The camera tracks the biker from behind as he approaches the crest of a rise, the engine booming.",
    "276": "In the opening scene, a BIKER is framed from his shins up, with a gas station visible in the background. He pauses, lost in thought or feeling. Suddenly, the bathroom door crashes open as the biker bursts in on his motorcycle, the bright daylight casting him in a striking silhouette. The sunlight streams in, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The camera quickly zooms in on a jar of hair jelly sitting on a shelf beneath a mirror. An extreme close-up reveals the biker's nostrils flaring as he sniffs sharply.\n\nThe scene shifts to a living room where Ed is bottle-feeding Nathan Jr., surrounded by rumpled sheets and blankets left by house guests. Gale and Evelle are intently eating cornflakes, their eyes fixed on something offscreen. Gale pauses to take a drag from a cigarette resting in an ashtray, a bead of milk trickling down his chin. He studies Ed thoughtfully before blowing out smoke and resuming his meal.\n\nHi enters the room, yawning, and holds the cornflakes box mid-air, noticing Ed's subtle gestures toward Gale and Evelle. The two men look confusedly from Ed to Hi. Ed, now more relaxed, appeals to Hi with a pleading look. Feeling her gaze, Hi returns to his cornflakes. Gale leans back, exhaling smoke toward the ceiling.\n\nHi, with Ed by his side, opens the door to welcome a young couple. Glen, a short, stocky blond man in his early thirties, is dressed in Bermuda shorts. Dot is elegantly attired in slacks, heels, and a scarf covering her hair. From behind, Glen playfully slaps Dot on the behind. She spins around and smacks him across the face with her purse, her teeth clenched in anger. Glen reels from the blow, seemingly more angry at himself than at Dot. She tiptoes into the trailer, hand to her mouth, trying to muffle her shrieks.\n\nGlen, rubbing his cheek, turns to the yard where a group of children, aged two to seven, are climbing all over Hi's car. One child beats on it with a stick, while another sits on the hood, tugging at a windshield wiper. As Ed and Dot approach the crib, Ed beams with pride. Dot dramatically reacts to the baby, feigning a faint and shielding her eyes as if blinded, before sneaking a peek around her hands.",
    "285": "In the opening scene, a woman, Miss Lonely Hearts, sits at her dressing table, clad in a Kelly Green suit. Jeff, watching from afar, smiles to himself as he raises a long-focus camera to his eye. The powerful lens zooms in, revealing unnoticed details about her. She wears ill-fitting, horn-rimmed reading glasses pushed halfway down her nose, tilting her head back to apply lipstick. After examining her reflection, she removes the glasses, revealing a face that, despite its faded beauty and decent clothing, is marred by an unflattering hairstyle that ages her.\n\nReaching for a tall glass of liquor, she takes a substantial sip before checking her lipstick again, squinting to see clearly. Dissatisfied, she puts her glasses back on to touch up her makeup, then tucks them away in her handbag. Standing up, she turns off the lights and moves to the living room, polishing off her drink. The long-focus lens follows her as she pours another generous helping of liquor, downs it, and then exits the apartment with resolve, switching off the lights as she leaves.\n\nJeff lowers his camera as the first notes of a familiar, unfinished melody catch his attention. Dressed in black tie, he appears to be expecting company. An attractive girl is busy preparing, arranging trays of canapés, glasses, ice, and liquor. She pauses, captivated by the songwriter's tune, and shares her admiration with him. He restarts the melody, playing it more fully this time, evoking a romantic response from her. Jeff's attention shifts again, this time to a dancing couple, Miss Torso and an unknown male partner, rehearsing a pas de deux to modern orchestral ballet music. A professional choreographer watches, interjecting occasionally, as the camera pans out to the street below. There stands Miss Lonely Hearts, the Kelly Green figure, scanning the street with an anxious demeanor.",
    "286": "A woman stands, undecided about her next move, anxiously eyeing a couple of men who pass by. Suddenly, a man swiftly raises his long-focus camera, and the scene shifts to a waist-high shot as he, Jeff, adjusts the focus. The subject of his attention is revealed to be Miss Lonely Hearts. Disappointed by the lack of reaction, she crosses the street and seats herself at an empty table in front of a café, ordering a drink. Her figure is abruptly obscured by a man entering the frame from the left—Thorwald, carrying a lightweight cardboard box.\n\nThe camera follows Thorwald as he moves to the right, disappearing behind a building. He is closer to the lens, slightly out of focus. Jeff lowers his camera, his eyes tracing Thorwald's presumed path. Sharpening his gaze, Jeff picks up the long-focus lens again, cautiously resuming his surveillance of Thorwald.\n\nThorwald approaches his apartment door, hesitating briefly to reveal the laundry name on the cardboard box he carries. Entering, he turns on the living room lights, then the bedroom lights, illuminating a pile of suits and topcoats neatly arranged on the bed. He removes the laundry from the box, placing it on the bed. Instead of putting the laundry away, he empties the dresser drawers, piling shirts, pajamas, and socks onto the bed.\n\nJeff quickly lowers his camera, dialing a number on his phone while keeping a watchful eye on Thorwald. The call is answered by a woman, and Jeff appears desperate for a moment. As he speaks, he thoughtfully examines some jewelry from a handbag—rings, a diamond wristwatch, a brooch, and pearls—seemingly trying to make a decision. He lowers his camera lens, inching his chair forward to better hear Thorwald.\n\nMeanwhile, the first four guests of a songwriter are welcomed by his girlfriend, accompanied by a loud, enthusiastic piano greeting. The songwriter offers drinks, and Jeff, giving up on eavesdropping, lifts the long-focus lens to his eyes once more, refocusing on Thorwald.",
    "290": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film opens with a tense exchange between three characters: Doyle, Jeff, and Lisa. **Doyle casts a scathing glance towards Lisa**, which prompts **Jeff to confront Doyle**. Lisa responds to Doyle's gaze, **her voice laced with ice**, and Doyle pauses, his eyes drifting to **Lisa's overnight case containing her lingerie**, before **turning his attention back to Jeff**. Jeff's reply is sharp and pointed, but **Lisa seems bewildered, unable to comprehend the situation**. Meanwhile, **Doyle nonchalantly brushes his coat lapels with a handkerchief**, seemingly unfazed by the tension. Both Jeff and Lisa wear **frosty, stern expressions**, offering no hint of warmth towards Doyle.\n\n**Doyle, maintaining his pleasant demeanor**, begins to **leave, grabbing his hat off a table as he casually strides towards the door**. He **pauses on the step, snapping his fingers**, before **ascending the stairs, placing his hat on his head, flashing a smile, and bidding them farewell**. **He quietly pulls the door shut behind him**, leaving Jeff and Lisa alone.\n\n**Jeff turns his wheelchair to face the window**, looking out at the neighborhood. **Lisa stands behind him, her mood somber**, neither of them sharing in **the lively party happening at the songwriter's crowded apartment nearby**. **Their attention is drawn to Miss Torso's apartment**, where **her legs are seen swinging in rhythm to record music**, even as **her gaze is fixed on Thorwald's apartment**.\n\n**Lisa, disinterested in Jeff's line of sight**, **murmurs something to him**, **her focus drawn to the apartment below**.

    "291": "Jeff, seated in his wheelchair near the bar with a drink in hand, is about to take a sip when Lisa emerges from the kitchen. She is a vision of beauty, draped in a sheer peach nightgown and a matching gossamer kimono, turning gracefully to face him, causing him to lower his drink.\n\nMeanwhile, the woman who owned the dog, upon hearing some news, pauses her sobbing and grips the railing of the fire escape fiercely. Guests at a songwriter's party silently retreat into a studio apartment, vacating their balcony. The woman, looking up at the apartment, is on the verge of screaming. Her husband leans over the fire escape, signaling to Miss Lonely Hearts to place the dog in a basket that has been lowered. Miss Lonely Hearts complies, watching as the husband carefully pulls the basket up, hand over hand, until he can tenderly lift the dog out. The woman, overcome with emotion, begins sobbing again and retreats into her apartment, her cries fading away. The husband turns to carry the dog into the apartment, and various neighbors return to their own homes: the newlyweds draw their shades, the landlord steps away from the window, Miss Torso retreats to her apartment, and Miss Hearing Aid turns down her hearing aid and goes back to her place.\n\nBack in the apartment, Jeff and Lisa are at the window, with Jeff holding one of her hands. Jeff speaks without looking up, and Lisa gazes down at him. He nods solemnly, and they both turn their attention back to Thorwald's apartment. The only visible light is the glowing end of a cigar, as if Thorwald is sitting quietly on his sofa, smoking. Later, Jeff, Stella, and Lisa are grouped at the window, with Jeff holding a long-focus lens to his eye. Through the lens, they observe Thorwald in his bathroom, meticulously wiping the enameled wall with a damp cloth, focusing on particular spots. They can see the upper part of Thorwald's bedroom window, but the lower part is obscured by a wall. Jeff lowers the camera, and neither he nor Lisa makes any comment, their faces now visible.",
    "292": "In the throes of a crucial moment, Stella abruptly speaks out. Lisa, drawn away from the window, is interrupted mid-action by Stella. Meanwhile, Jeff, still fixated on the scene outside, wears an expression of sudden revelation. He urgently calls out, swiveling halfway around to point at something. Behind him, Lisa moves towards a shelf, prompting him to add more information. With his right hand outstretched, Jeff awaits the box and viewer, his gaze never leaving the window.\n\nThe camera pulls back slightly as Lisa approaches, placing the box and viewer into Jeff's waiting hand. He swiftly opens the box, revealing color slides, and examines a couple by holding them up to the light. Lisa watches curiously, and Stella steps forward from the background. Jeff squints through the viewer, momentarily looking away before peering through it again. Removing the viewer from his eye, he passes it to Lisa, who raises it to her own eye. Through the viewer, the scene outside the window is magnified, and as it is lowered, the real-world view is revealed, gently rustled by a breeze.\n\nJeff glances up at a bewildered Lisa, and all three step back in awe. Lisa, still fixated on the window, speaks up. Suddenly, Stella begins to chuckle, her amusement fading as she addresses their silent inquiry. Jeff turns his attention to Stella, and midway through Lisa's speech, he begins to talk.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to Lisa appearing at the ground floor door below Thorwald's apartment. She presses against the wall, hiding tensely. Above, Thorwald returns, his frustration evident. He steps out onto the fire escape directly above Lisa, who retreats into the doorway, acutely aware of his presence. She vanishes down the lower corridor as Thorwald searches his fire escape, both sighing in relief.\n\nBack in the apartment, Jeff hands something to Lisa. Stella's brow furrows as she notices something, reaching for the long focus lens and lifting it to her eye. Meanwhile, in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, a candle and other lamps softly illuminate the room. Dressed in simple street clothes, she sits at a table, opening a black-covered book with fine print. She reads by candlelight, occasionally glancing at four red capsules laid out on the table.\n\nStella and Jeff's voices are heard in the background as Lisa descends the stairs, rejoining them. The tension and mystery build palpably amidst their interactions and observations.",
    "295": "In the gripping sequence, Thorwald unlocks his apartment door and enters, narrowly missing Lisa who dashes back into the bedroom to avoid detection. Stella watches intensely, her face a picture of tension and fear. Meanwhile, a policeman on the phone repeats his message with deliberate irritation. Suddenly, Stella's expression shifts sharply as she glances slightly to the left.\n\nThe first policeman gestures for Lisa to accompany him, pausing briefly to instruct the second policeman to take a statement from Thorwald regarding the attempted burglary. The second policeman confiscates the jewelry from Thorwald's hand for examination. During this brief interlude, Lisa discreetly waves her left hand behind her back, then stops and spreads her fingers wide. A closer view reveals her waving hand, and with her other hand, she points to the wedding ring on her left hand.\n\nThrough his camera, Jeff observes the scene unfold. The lens pans upward and across, framing Thorwald's profile as he looks down directly at Lisa's hands. Slowly, Thorwald turns his head and stares right into the lens, suddenly realizing that Lisa is signaling to someone watching him. Jeff and Stella exchange a glance before Jeff drops the camera into his lap. Stella hurriedly moves away from the window, turning off the lights as Jeff backs his chair into the room.\n\nAs Thorwald's attention is diverted back to the second policeman for further questioning, the first policeman escorts Lisa out of the apartment by the arm. Jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets, and Stella retrieves a billfold, handing it to Jeff. He extracts some bills and begins counting them, looking up sharply at Stella before resuming his count without comment. Stella watches, then fetches her purse as Jeff finishes counting the money.\n\nThorwald leaves his apartment and proceeds down the corridor. Stella approaches the door, pausing as Jeff grabs and picks up the phone, hanging up just as he looks toward Thorwald's now completely dark apartment. Puzzled, Jeff moves forward a couple of steps, gripping the flash holder more tightly and lifting it slightly, prepared for whatever might come next. Thorwald advances to the middle of the room, his eyes fixed on Jeff, hands clenched in a struggle to control his rising anger.",
    "296": "In a tense sequence, the man takes a step forward. Thorwald descends two steps, halting at the bottom. Meanwhile, Miss Lonely Hearts stands in her apartment's yard, gazing up at Miss Torso's porch. Thorwald struggles fiercely to break free from Jeff's hold, the intensity of the fight etched on Jeff's pained face. Doyle, pulling himself up to the top of the wall, sees Jeff precariously hanging out the window, enduring Thorwald's relentless blows with bare fists. The struggle between Thorwald and Jeff is brutal and unyielding.\n\nDoyle reaches the wall's summit and looks up at Jeff, who is barely maintaining his grip under Thorwald's frenzied assault. Jeff's hold begins to falter, and Lisa watches in terrified anticipation, her face pale with fear. Jeff opens his eyes, grimacing in pain. Doyle glances up at the detective, and Stella urgently whispers something into Doyle's ear, standing on tiptoe to reach him. Doyle turns to her, puzzled.\n\nThe camera pans from Jeff's window thermometer, sweeping from right to left across the neighborhood. In the songwriter's apartment, he plays his newly recorded song for Miss Lonely Hearts, who appears content and well-adjusted. The song fills the air with a rich symphonic arrangement. Thorwald's apartment stands empty, its walls being repainted. The whistler and her husband train a new white dog on their fire escape. Miss Torso, dressed in a white leotard, resumes her ballet practice but is interrupted by a knock at the door. Cautiously, she opens it, and upon recognizing the visitor, welcomes a modest and slightly shy army private who enters with a barracks bag. She kisses him affectionately, and he settles in, checking the icebox for food with the ease of someone at home.\n\nThe newlyweds are engaged in a heated argument. The camera pans past Jeff, asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window, his legs both in casts. Lisa, dressed in Levis and a plaid cotton shirt, sits nearby on the sofa, engrossed in a travel book. She glances briefly at Jeff and, realizing he's asleep, exchanges her travel book for the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar.",
    "300": "In the opening moments, two glasses are produced and held aloft before being placed on the table. A bottle of wine is uncorked, the corkscrew twisting its way in. Carl emerges from the kitchen, carrying an empty warming oven, and sets it down as he notices Lisa grappling with the corkscrew. Disregarding a nearby pile of money, he pockets it swiftly. He then retrieves the warming oven once again. Meanwhile, Lisa pauses her struggle with the corkscrew, lets out a small laugh, and casts a mildly reproachful glance at Jeff. Taking a sip of her drink, she slides closer to him, the camera capturing her intense, earnest expression as she gazes up at him. Jeff responds with a short, amused chuckle, followed by a sigh of relief. He looks down thoughtfully before shaking off his distraction and turning his gaze toward the neighborhood outside his window.\n\nLisa withdraws into the kitchen, leaving Jeff to observe his surroundings. His focus lands on an unfamiliar apartment below his, where a middle-aged woman, living alone, applies makeup in her bedroom mirror. Her plain dress hangs loosely on her frame, hinting at a special occasion. Jeff's curiosity piques, and he leans in for a better look. Behind him, Lisa is faintly visible setting a table. The camera pans slightly, revealing more of the woman's living room. She enters, smiling, having prepared a candlelit dinner for two. Her slim figure moves around the room as she mimics welcoming a guest, taking his hat, and sharing a light kiss. She leads him to the table, vanishes briefly, and returns with wine and glasses. Pouring two drinks, she raises hers in a silent toast to her imaginary companion. Jeff, captivated, mirrors her gesture and takes a sip from his own glass, his eyes fixed on the poignant scene. As the woman begins to take a sip, her smile dissolves, and she places her glass back on the table, her head dropping in quiet despair.",
    "302": "In the quiet of a still morning, the newlyweds' apartment remains shrouded with drawn shades, despite a solitary light burning within. Jeff gazes at the concealed window, a soft, warm smile playing on his lips. His eyes drift away, slowly scanning the neighborhood to his right, his expression turning serious as he notices something peculiar. He pauses, his stare fixed on the point of interest.\n\nMeanwhile, in the salesman's apartment, a dinner tray is carefully prepared and carried from the kitchen, through the living room, and into the bedroom. The salesman places it gently on his wife's lap as she sits upright in bed, propping a couple of pillows behind her for comfort. Her face, however, bears a look of dissatisfaction. She begins to voice her criticisms, but he thinks better of responding. Instead, he leaves the room, while she grudgingly starts to eat.\n\nQuietly, the husband lifts the phone and dials a number, unaware that his wife has moved the tray and is now listening at the bedroom door. He pours himself a drink in the kitchen, his demeanor shifting noticeably as his call connects. A warmth spreads across his face as he relaxes, speaking softly and guardedly, occasionally glancing towards the bedroom door.\n\nJeff, from his vantage point, becomes completely engrossed in the scene unfolding. He leans forward, his attention rapt. Although the wall obscures the wife from view, her arm suddenly appears in the living room, pointing accusingly at her husband and the telephone. The man hurriedly ends the call, his face flushing with anger as he storms towards the bedroom.\n\nInside, his wife is laughing, her amusement only fueling his anger. The more she laughs, the more his fury grows, and the harder she laughs. She climbs back into bed, still laughing, prompting him to leave the room in a huff. He retreats to the kitchen, pouring himself another drink before turning his gaze towards the composer's apartment.\n\nThrough the studio window, the song-writer is seen working diligently on his melody, having made notable progress. Back in Jeff's view, Lisa emerges from the kitchen, carrying a serving dish of their lobster thermidor, ready to share a meal with her observant neighbor.",

Kayleigh carries prosthetic arms, a stark symbol of Evan's challenges. In a desperate attempt to escape his wheelchair, Evan lunges forward, tumbling out clumsily.\n\nEvan struggles to focus on Lenny amidst the snickering crowd. Kayleigh, ever his protector, turns to face the jeering onlookers, who eventually disperse. Together, Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad, Evan now equipped with prosthetic arms. A glimmer of hope shines in Evan's eyes as he sees someone familiar, but the moment is fleeting.\n\nKayleigh guides Evan away from the others, stopping at a bench. She casually turns his chair to face her and offers him a granola bar. Evan's prosthetic hand crushes it to dust, a poignant reminder of his limitations. Kayleigh's sadness is palpable, but she is quickly distracted by Lenny waving her over. Evan watches, heartbroken, as Kayleigh joins Lenny, and the two share a kiss.\n\nIn a chilling turn, Evan, fully clothed, lies in a bathtub filling with water, his wheelchair tipped over beside him. The water rises past his mouth, to his nostrils, but Evan remains calm, taking a final breath. Tommy enters, pushing a lever that sends the mechanical wheelchair rolling out of the room. Evan watches as Lenny dumps his belongings—old report cards, books, toys, and photo albums—onto the floor. A sense of nostalgia fills the air as Evan beams at the sight of his old journal in Lenny's hands.\n\nThe story takes an abrupt turn as Evan finds himself in his childhood kitchen, springing to his feet with triumphant flexes of his real hands. He rummages through the utensil drawer, pulling out a large butcher knife. Despite his efforts, he struggles to tuck it into his sock, a final image of determination and resilience.",
    "314": "Evan is frozen in awe as he gazes at the peculiar machine before him. Meanwhile, in the basement, Mr. Miller secures a camera onto a tripod, positioning it meticulously. Kayleigh and Evan take their seats on folding chairs arranged in front of the camera, while Tommy observes from the top of the basement stairs, his gaze fixed downwards. Mr. Miller speaks to Evan and Kayleigh in a lowered, conspiratorial tone before taking his position behind the camera. Suddenly, the door at the top of the stairs creaks open, and an unseen figure peers in, eyes wide with horror at the scene unfolding below.\n\nWith deliberate steps, Mr. Miller moves behind Kayleigh, firmly cupping his hands over her ears, isolating her from all sound. Evan, noticing Kayleigh's confinement, leans in to whisper something, causing her to shift her gaze from the floor to her father, a shiver running down her spine. Evan, startled by her abrupt movement, jolts back and tumbles to the floor, his eyes locked onto Kayleigh. She witnesses a trickle of blood escape Evan's nose, her eyes widening in alarm, while he remains frozen on the ground, shock coursing through him.\n\n Later, Evan finds himself standing in Kayleigh's bedroom, an array of sorority plaques and pink, preppy decor surrounding him. He can barely tear his gaze away from her as she offers him a tissue. Collecting his clothes from the foot of the bed, he grasps a fraternity sweatshirt adorned with Greek letters and a brown suede jacket. A frown of distaste crosses his face, prompting him to snatch a towel and make his exit. At the sink, Evan scrubs the dried blood from his face, his reflection staring back at him from the mirror. A sudden movement catches his eye—Gwen, a familiar sorority sister from the bar, emerging from the shower, unclothed. She playfully pats his behind before sauntering out of the bathroom.\n\nSoon after, Kayleigh, dressed in a long skirt and form-fitting red sweater, commands the attention of every male on campus as she and Evan traverse the quadrangle arm in arm. Students wave and call out Evan's name en masse. Unexpectedly, Kayleigh plants a significant kiss on Evan before departing, leaving him momentarily astonished. Shaking off his surprise, he hurriedly continues to class. Evan feeds his last quarter into the lobby payphone, hurriedly dialing a number before hanging up and checking his watch. Just then, Thumper crosses paths with Evan, leaving him bewildered as he walks away.\n\nWith a burst of speed, Evan dashes into the lecture hall, joining the queue of students helping themselves to No. 2 pencils from Professor Carter's desk. Making his way up the aisle, he takes a seat, only to feel an arm snake menacingly around his throat from behind. Turning around, Evan finds himself face to face with Hunter, the fraternity brother that Thumper had assaulted at Dirty Hank's bar. Discreetly, Hunter slips Evan a cheat-sheet for the exam. A knowing nod and smile pass between them as the examination papers make their way down the row.\n\nMuch later, Evan and Kayleigh find themselves in an intimate embrace, having just consummated their passion.",
    "316": "In a cacophony of jeers and insults, hardened prisoners taunt the newest arrivals. Amidst the din, Evan maintains his composure, stepping towards his designated cell. His gaze lifts to the second tier where Karl, a brawny inmate adorned with Nazi tattoos, blows a taunting kiss. Evan enters his dim, saint-plastered cell to find Carlos, a formidable Hispanic convict with faded religious tattoos, sitting on the lower bunk. Carlos watches Evan prepare his bed with detached indifference before departing without a word.\n\nLater, Evan joins a table of inmates, including Carlos, who offhandedly offers him a roll. In the visiting room, Evan faces Andrea through the Plexiglas divide, their conversation monitored as she holds up two composition books. An intense gaze passes between them before Evan slowly returns the phone to its cradle, leaving Andrea with the receiver still pressed to her ear.\n\nTrailing Carlos through a corridor, Evan clutches his journals closely. Karl, seizing an opportunity, grabs at Evan, who freezes in shock. Another Neo-Nazi, Rick, sends Evan's journals scattering. Evan and Rick grapple for the notebooks, but Rick successfully tears them from Evan's grasp, leaving him with only a few ripped pages. Seeing the destruction, Evan unravels.\n\nCradling a torn journal entry, Evan finishes a conversation, his focus now solely on the damaged page. His mind drifts back to Mrs. Boswell's first grade class, where children are engrossed in drawing vibrant pictures. Mrs. Boswell redirects Evan to his seat, and with a mischievous grin, he begins to sketch a morbid scene: himself, knife in hand, standing over the lifeless bodies of Karl and Rick.\n\nAfter completing his drawing, Evan sneaks to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where two paper spindles stand. With all his seven-year-old might, he slams his hands down towards the spindles. In that fleeting moment, sounds clash and the world behind him trembles.",
    "319": "In the thrall of the Ring, Frodo's hand trembles outward, and he collapses, unable to resist its power. The Witch King attacks, driving a dagger into Frodo's shoulder. Just as the Ringwraiths close in, Strider bursts onto the scene, sword and torch in hand, moving with deliberate slowness through the mist. Frodo, with his last ounce of strength, removes the Ring. Sam rushed to his side, while a distant Ringwraith cry echoes. Frodo gasps in pain, prompting Sam and Strider to frantically search for Athelas, a small white flowered plant. Strider finds it, looking up to see Frodo gravely ill.\n\nThrough Frodo's half-conscious gaze, a shimmering figure in white appears, revealing itself as Arwen. She takes Frodo and mounts her horse, Asfaloth. Strider watches, struggling to let her go. Arwen and Frodo vanish into the night, the forest passing by as the white horse charges through the trees. At dawn, they emerge from the forest, but danger lurks—Ringwraiths give chase, growing in number until nine pursue them. Arwen, determined, pushes her horse faster. The Witch King, screeching, leads the chase across the Ford.\n\nA bright light suddenly bursts forth, and Frodo awakens in a bed bathed in dappled sunlight, the sound of a waterfall nearby. Gandalf quietly puffs on his pipe, a silent sentinel.",
    "320": "In the depths of Isengard, a smile lights up Gandalf's face as he looks at Frodo. Frodo, puzzled, sits up and gazes at Gandalf with questioning eyes, a troubled expression etched on his face. His gaze soon drifts away, unfocused. Towering over Gandalf, Saruman stands, gloating in his triumph. With a cruel twist of his staff, Saruman first lifts Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing back down. Yet, with a sudden burst of energy, Gandalf lurches to his feet and hurls himself off the tower, leaving Saruman to watch in disbelief as Gandalf is borne away on the back of Gwaihir, a majestic eagle soaring over the mountains toward the breaking dawn.\n\nBack in the quiet room, Frodo stirs and looks at Gandalf, drawing Sam quickly to his side. Joy radiates from Sam as he finds Frodo awake, his face bearing the marks of many glad and sorrowful memories. Following Sam's gaze, Frodo turns to see an aged Bilbo Baggins sitting alone on a bench, basking in the sun. A broad grin spreads across Bilbo's face as Frodo rushes to embrace him, the years having taken their toll on Bilbo since their last meeting. Together, they sit on a terrace overlooking a waterfall, Frodo carefully turning the pages of Bilbo's red leather-bound journal, marveling at the beautiful handwriting, intricate maps, and detailed drawings—a testament to Bilbo's adventures. A map of the Shire catches Frodo's eye, and Bilbo beams with pride.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam hurriedly packs for their journey, stuffing an already full pack with pots, pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, and clothes. He looks up, startled, as Gandalf and Elrond observe Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony. Elrond turns and retreats indoors, while Gandalf lingers, looking out the window. A vision unfolds: Isildur, wielding the broken sword, slices off Sauron's finger, causing Elrond to react with a mix of emotions. Isildur then turns and departs, leaving the scene behind.\n\nIn the shadowy halls of Rivendell, Strider watches Boromir, who strolls through a darkened gallery, his eyes drawn to an old fresco depicting Isildur's victory over Sauron. Boromir's gaze shifts to Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, lying on a cloth-covered plinth. He senses Strider's presence, looking from the blade to Strider as if recognizing a hidden connection. Night descends upon the tranquil valley of Rivendell, and Strider stands with Arwen on a stone bridge, the Evenstar gleaming at her breast under the moonlight. Arwen looks deeply into Strider's eyes, placing the jewel in his hand, and leaning in to kiss him softly.\n\nElrond addresses a diverse council comprising free peoples of Middle-earth: Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and twenty other elves, dwarves, and men. Among them, Frodo takes his place. He steps forward, placing the One Ring on a stone plinth before returning to his seat. Strider remains silent, while Boromir turns away dismissively, only to sharply turn back as Legolas stands up, ready to speak. Frodo looks at Strider, a questioning gaze etched on his face, awaiting the decisions that will shape their journey ahead.",
    "326": "**Movie Description:**\n\nLurtz, leading 200 Uruk-hai, dashes out of Isengard, their powerful legs propelling them swiftly through the landscape. Meanwhile, the Fellowship departs Lothlórien in small elven boats, watched quietly by the elves from the shore. As they row into the Silverlode river, Frodo is haunted by the echo of Galadriel's voice in his mind. Just before their departure, Galadriel gifts Frodo a small crystal phial, standing alone on the riverbank as the boats drift away, merging into the great river Anduin and sweeping steadily southward.\n\nThe lush green trees gradually yield to a barren, withered landscape. Meanwhile, the Uruk-hai forces rush through the forest, their deadly intent palpable. Aragorn, watching them, grows concerned. As dawn breaks, the three elven boats drift through a steep, rocky gorge, Aragorn paddling slowly in the stern. Frodo gazes up in awe at two colossal statues—300-foot tall carvings of ancient Gondorian kings, their majestic forms looming over the boats as the current pulls them through the narrow passage. The Fellowship stared, silent and stunned, as the statues' vast, crumbling heads reveal a large lake just a mile downriver.\n\nClambering onto the wooded shore, Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency, a look Aragorn understands instantly. Legolas scans the Parth Galen forest warily. Sam, who had slumped asleep, jolts awake as Aragorn realizes Boromir is gone, his shield abandoned by his camp bed.\n\nBeneath the trees, Frodo wanders deep in thought. He turns slowly, tensing as he sees Boromir. Boromir lurches forward but hesitates. Frodo steps back cautiously, turning to leave, but Boromir leaps, grasping for the Ring. With mere moments to react, Frodo yanks the Ring from his neck and slips it onto his finger.\n\nPlunged into a misty twilight world, Frodo dashes past twisted, foggy trees. Behind him, Boromir's anguished cries echo as if from another realm. Suddenly, Frodo finds himself on ancient stone steps leading to a high seat supported by four stone pillars—a throne of mountain kings. Cowering, he seems a lost child amidst the swirling mist. The ominous form of Barad-dûr, Sauron's fortress, looms in his vision—a towering mountain of iron, immeasurably strong.",
    "328": "In the heart of a verdant, overgrown field teeming with white flowers and lush grass, a small rock serves as a humble seat. This idyllic scene, set at the end of a long, hot summer, reveals a figure lost in the pages of a book. As the figure stirs, we meet Frodo Baggins, a handsome young hobbit with dark curly hair and piercing blue eyes sparkling with excitement. Tossing aside a blade of grass, Frodo dashes off, leaving the tranquil setting behind.\n\nSixty years later, a cart rattles along a leafy lane, guided by a stooped figure cloaked in gray. An old pony snorts and rears, startled by something unseen. Beneath the dappled sunlight of an ancient tree, a figure lies peacefully. Suddenly, Frodo appears on a bank above the cart. Their eyes meet, and laughter fills the air as Frodo leaps onto the cart's front seat. The unlikely pair journey past a field of lupins, where the cart's rumble catches the attention of the field's tender.\n\nGandalf, the gray-cloaked figure, gazes down at Frodo with a playful twinkle in his eye. Their journey continues over a stone bridge, leading them to a bustling Hobbit Marketplace. Hobbits pause, exclaiming in wonder as Gandalf and Frodo pass the Green Dragon Inn, heading towards the party field. Scores of hobbits are busy preparing for a grand event, but Odo Proudfoot eyes the cart with suspicion.\n\nHobbiton, a quaint rural settlement cradled among rolling green hills and towering trees, welcomes the duo. Excited children chase after the cart, their gleeful cries ignored by Gandalf. As the cart rolls away, the children stand deflated, their joy seemingly short-lived. But then, a burst of bright, fizzing orbs erupts from the cart, delighting the children—a clever trick courtesy of a smiling Gandalf. Even Odo can't help but chuckle at the whimsical display.\n\nFrodo stands in the cart as Gandalf reins in the horse, revealing the charming Hobbit homes: neat burrows carved into the grassy hillside, distinguished by round doors and well-kept front gardens. Bag End, the finest example of these dwellings, awaits with its large, round front door nestled into the hill.\n\nAs Gandalf raises his staff to rap on the door, a voice responds from within. The door swings open to reveal Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit of indeterminate age with a mischievous gleam in his eye. Dapperly dressed in a brocade waistcoat, Bilbo embodies the eccentric gentleman. Gandalf, overcome with warmth, drops to his knee to embrace his longtime friend.",

Seated nearby, he is joined by his orc overseer who approaches with a grim purpose. Meanwhile, Gandalf lies unconscious on the cold, hard obsidian floor, far from Saruman's presence. Awakening, Gandalf stands, revealing his precarious predicament as the camera retreats to show him stranded on Orthanc's peak. A haunting wail pierces the air, emphasizing his isolation on the tiny summit, surrounded by a sheer 500-foot drop.\n\nRushing to the edge, Gandalf looks down in horror as orcs viciously hack at an ancient tree of Isengard with their axes, uprooting it from the ground. Saruman, standing in the pouring rain, gazes into the dark night, his orc overseer sweating and exerted by his side. More trees are brutally felled as Gandalf watches, helpless and despairing.\n\nElsewhere, the hobbits journey through the rugged countryside, led by the steadfast Strider. Pausing before a distant hill crowned with an ancient ruin, the group eventually finds themselves halfway up Weathertop, collapsed in a small hollow, muddy and exhausted. Strider provides them with small swords, a gesture of protection and preparation for the trials ahead.\n\nFrodo awakens abruptly, his eyes flickering open as he sniffs the air. His companions—Sam, Merry, and Pippin—huddle over a small fire, savoring the sizzle of sausages and bacon. Suddenly, five Ringwraiths on foot ascend the steep slope with unnatural speed, prompting the hobbits to clutch their swords and scramble desperately towards the summit.\n\nReaching the peak, they race into a ring of broken stones, the remnants of an ancient tower.

With a terrifying shriek, the spectre sweeps his sword downwards, but Aragorn, in a swift motion, raises his own blade, Andúril. The swords clash with a resonant ring of metal, echoing through the caverns. The King of the Dead stares in disbelief as Aragorn seizes the ghost by the neck, holding his sharp blade against the spectre's throat before releasing him. Ghostly faces watch in hollow-eyed astonishment.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of orcs march relentlessly towards the walls of Minas Tirith.

    "343": "The fate of the journey hinges on Frodo entering the tunnel. He peers into the inky blackness, his heart pounding. Gollum, with his scant, greasy hair obscuring his eyes, leads the way. Taking a deep breath, Frodo follows Gollum into the darkness, with the sound of Gollum's scampering and his voice echoing through the murky passage as their only guide. Frodo, exhausted, struggles to keep up, eventually losing sight of Gollum. He slips, his hand brushing the wall for support, only to recoil as it touches sticky, web-like threads. Panic surges as eerie creaking echoes through the darkness, hinting at some massive, jointed creature lurking ahead. Frodo begins to run, blind with fear.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam desperately descends an ancient staircase, his face a mask of devastation. He slips, tumbling out of control until he collides with a large rock, saving him from a deadly fall. A package of lembas bread catches his eye, and he stares at it, barely breathing. Looking back up the staircase, he sees Frodo running blindly, only to fall and become ensnared in a sticky web. A voice from a distant memory reaches Frodo, sparking a flicker of hope. He fumbles in his jacket, withdrawing the glass phial gifted by Galadriel. Its light reveals Gollum on the other side of the web.\n\nWith a surge of determination, Frodo slashes wildly with Sting, the blade gleaming as it cuts through the fibrous strands. The webs snap back, lashing his face, but he hacks away, desperate to free himself. The tunnel lights up with the glow of Galadriel's phial, illuminating the approaching shadow of Shelob. Gollum, gripped by fear, bolts, leaving Frodo to struggle alone. With a final, desperate lunge, Frodo breaks free, but Sting remains caught in the web. He abandons the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice, tumbling out of Shelob's lair onto cold rock, drenched in sweat and covered in cobwebs.\n\nAs Frodo looks up, Gollum lunges at him, igniting a fierce struggle. They grapple, rolling towards the edge of a precipice. Frodo pins Gollum, his hands clutching the creature's throat. But a sudden moment of self-realization horrifies Frodo, and he releases Gollum, recoiling from his own violence.",

Frodo falls perilously close to the edge of a precipice, and Gollum tumbles over Frodo's body, plunging to the bottom of the ravine. Overcome with exhaustion and remorse for his treatment of Sam, Frodo stumbles down the steep stairs of Cirith Ungol, eventually falling to his knees onto soft green grass.\n\nSun-drenched images of trees fill his vision, and a hazy figure of Galadriel, barefoot, walks towards him. She leans down, offering her hand. Frodo gazes at her, torn between his desire to rest and his knowledge of what he must do. With renewed determination, he is lifted to his feet, once again finding himself in the dark tunnels of the Pass of Cirith Ungol, pressing onward.\n\nMeanwhile, flaming missiles rain down on Minas Tirith. The mighty siege weapon, Grond, thuds against the city's gate, sending vibrations rippling through the streets. Gandalf, astride Shadowfax, leads several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers down through the city. Pippin watches as Faramir's unconscious body is carried on a stretcher by Denethor’s servants, led by Denethor himself, in a somber procession akin to a funeral. An iron door creaks open, revealing a wide vaulted chamber filled with rows of marble tombs, each bearing a stone-carved sleeping form. Denethor turns to his servants as the lantern light casts great shadows on the shrouded walls.\n\nSuddenly, with a resounding boom, the gate splinters under Grond's might. Behind the gates, the Gondorian foot soldiers are filled with fear. Gandalf rallies a line of bowmen as their courage wavers with each crashing blow. The fearsome head of Grond protrudes into Minas Tirith, and within moments, the gate is smashed. Giant cave trolls pour into the first circle of the city, a place no enemy has ever breached. Rows of archers fire volleys of arrows, but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their massive clubs. Orcs swarm through the opening, and the battle spills into the flames and blackened, smoldering buildings.\n\nWith a roar, Gandalf leads a counterattack on Shadowfax, followed by several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers. Thousands of orcs flood through the city gates, breaching the first level. Frodo, staggering through the Pass of Cirith Ungol, feels the weight of the Ring dragging at his neck. Fueled by a grim resolve, he moves forward, climbing a stone staircase that winds through a narrow pass.",
    "345": "Nestled between towering peaks that stretch towards a weary sky, the summit of Cirith Ungol looms ahead, marked by an ominous Orc watch tower. A faint light flickers within the stone structure, casting long shadows that dance macabrely on the cold rocks. The path over the summit is starkly visible to the Orcs, forcing Frodo to press close to the rock wall, hidden by the dark silhouettes. Unbeknownst to him, Shelob, a monstrous spider, emerges from the shadows, her hideous form stealthily trailing Frodo as he climbs the stone stairs, his eyes fixed warily on the Orc tower.\n\nSuddenly, Frodo's senses tingle with an eerie malice. He whirls around, but before he can act, Shelob viciously plunges her stinger into his neck. Frodo's body goes instantly limp, caught by Shelob's legs as she begins to spin webs around him with frightening speed. With a practiced dexterity, she wraps him from head to toe in a sticky cocoon.\n\nJust as Shelob finishes her grim task, the sharp edge of a sword cuts through the air. Samwise Gamgee stands resolute before the giant spider, clutching Sting in one hand and the Phial of Galadriel in the other. Shelob hisses menacingly, dropping Frodo, who rolls down the stairs, encased in the web. Sam steps forward, his usually friendly eyes ablaze with determination. He swings the small sword upward, slashing at Shelob. She rears back, her stinger dripping with venom, but Sam ducks under her legs and stabs Sting into one of her eye clusters. Shelob screams in agony, her mandibles thrashing as green ooze trickles from her wounded eye.\n\nWith her hind legs, Shelob lifts Sam off the ground and tosses him backward. He lands heavily, but as Shelob pounces, heaving her belly above him, Sam raises the Elven blade with both hands. Sting slices into Shelob's soft underbelly, causing a shudder to ripple through her. She heaves up again, wrenching herself away from the pain, her limbs writhing. Mortally wounded, Shelob jerks and quivers, crawling towards her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime. She squeezes down the hole, her bubbling misery fading into the distance.\n\nSam rushes to Frodo, ripping away the cobwebs from his head. Frodo's face is deathly pale, his head lolling lifelessly in Sam's arms. Despair gripping him, Sam lays his face on Frodo's chest, weeping softly. As he looks up, he sees the Orc tower and Sting glowing blue—a sign of approaching Orcs. A small party of Orcs and Uruk-hai, led by Shagrat and Gorbag, descends the stairs from the watch tower. Sam knows he must act quickly.",
    "348": "The movie opens with a hail of arrows raining down on the Rohan soldiers, swiftly followed by a continued charge. Amidst the chaos, Gandalf swiftly turns Shadowfax around and pulls Pippin onto the horse. Meanwhile, the Rohan charge wreaks havoc on the enemy lines.\n\nIn a dramatic shift, Denethor is seen standing on a table, straddling Faramir, as he pours oil over his own head. The oil cascades through his hair, down his face, and quickly soaks his robes. Faramir, awakening from his delirium, struggles to focus as oil splashes onto his chest. Surrounding them are bundles of oil-soaked wood, and servants holding flaming torches, awaiting orders. Denethor gives a nod, and the servants move toward the pyre, torches held firmly.\n\nAt that very moment, Gandalf and Pippin burst into the hallows on Shadowfax. The frightened servants back away from the pyre. Denethor, in a fit of rage, snatches a flaming torch and hurls it at the pyre, setting it ablaze. Gandalf charges toward the pyre, knocking Denethor to his feet. Pippin leaps from Shadowfax onto the burning pyre and, with desperate strength, pushes Faramir off it. They tumble down the bundles of wood, hitting the floor, where Pippin quickly douses the flames on Faramir's clothing. Denethor screams with fury and leaps across the pyre, tearing at Pippin. As flames spread up his oil-soaked back, Shadowfax rears up and strikes Denethor, who falls back onto the pyre. For a brief moment, Denethor looks into his son's eyes, and sanity seems to return.\n\nFlames begin to engulf Denethor, and suddenly, he lurches off the pyre, becoming a screaming, unguided ball of flame. He runs across the chamber and out of the door, eventually plummeting from a 700-foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. His death plunge coincides with the Rohirrim gaining the upper hand, slaying vast numbers of orcs or putting them to flight.\n\nKing Théoden stands proud in his saddle, rallying his Rohirrim. His joy turns to horror as massive elephant-like creatures, each carrying a war-tower packed with Haradrim archers, emerge across the battlefield. Gandalf, circling among the soldiers on his horse, looks at Pippin with a sense of foreboding. Pippin, in turn, gazes up at Gandalf with fear in his eyes. Their exchange is interrupted as the wooden doors shudder under yet another blow.\n\nThe battlefield descends into chaos, with the Mumakil decimating the valiant Rohirrim. Théoden desperately tries to rally his men amid the chaos of crying soldiers and neighing horses. Suddenly, the Witch-King swoops down on his Nazgûl, scooping up Théoden and his horse.",
    "352": "In the shadowed expanse below, all eyes are riveted on the bleak plain. Thousands of orcs can be seen retreating from the ominous Mount Doom, their dark silhouettes marching away in grim procession. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam traverse a desolate landscape, a hellish terrain of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. The distant Mount Doom looms 40 miles away, its colossal cone rising from ashen ruins, cloaked in reeking clouds at its summit.\n\nAragorn's force of 500 soldiers advances toward the imposing Black Gates of Mordor, positioning themselves about half a mile away. Exhausted, Frodo slumps against a rock, attempting to drink from his water bottle only to find it empty. Sam offers his own bottle, and Frodo takes a grateful sip. A poignant moment of eye contact passes between them, acknowledging the daunting journey ahead. Sam extends his hand, helping Frodo to his feet.\n\nAt the Black Gates, Aragorn rallies his men. Frodo and Sam, now shed of their orc armor, struggle across the tortured landscape. Frodo's steps are faltering, his eyes seemingly blind to the path before him. His right hand clutches his chest, bearing an unseen burden, while his left hand occasionally rises as if to fend off an invisible threat. Sam's face is etched with concern as Frodo hears a malevolent voice echoing in his mind.\n\nSuddenly, a ray of crimson light slices through the gloom, sweeping over the barren terrain. Sam dives to the ground, but Frodo turns towards the light, unable to resist its pull. The red beam strikes him, and he collapses, motionless. An eerie silence descends.\n\nGandalf stands watchful, nodding at Aragorn. Together with Legolas, Gimli, Éomer, Merry, and Pippin, they gallop towards the Black Gates, halting less than 50 yards away. The air is filled with the terrifying chanting and clanging armor of the vast orc army hidden behind the colossal gates. With a deafening groan of tortured metal, the gates begin to creak open. Legolas, Merry, and Éomer watch in growing dread.\n\nAs the Eye of Sauron scans the plains, Sam rises to his feet. The Black Gates swing wide, revealing Sauron's formidable army of 300,000. Aragorn, Gandalf, and their companions swiftly gallop back to their small force as the orc masses slowly advance. The Eye of Sauron fixes its malevolent gaze upon them.\n\nFrodo's eyes open with a jolt. Sam crawls towards him, and together, they stagger to their feet, pressing onward. The immense orc army marches relentlessly towards Aragorn's soldiers, who begin to waver as they are encircled by the enemy's overwhelming numbers.",
    "354": "In a surge of relief and joy, Sam can hardly contain his emotions. Suddenly, Smeagol comes crashing into them, sending Sam and Frodo sprawling to the ground. Smeagol pounces on Frodo, wrapping his bony, white fingers around Frodo's throat in a deadly grip. Frodo struggles desperately to break free, but Smeagol's hold is unyielding, squeezing the life out of him. Just as hope seems lost, a rock smashes into the side of Smeagol's head, stunning him momentarily. Seizing the opportunity, Sam leaps onto the dazed Smeagol.\n\nAmidst the raging battle between men and orcs, the Nazgul swoop down from Mordor, high overhead, into the fray. The old hatred between Sam and Smeagol boils over as they engage in a fierce fight. Sam is thrown back, but he quickly regains his footing, pushing Smeagol away with his feet. With Smeagol charging at him again, Sam slashes out with Sting, cutting Smeagol across the stomach. Smeagol staggers backward, screaming in pain.\n\nDesperate to find Frodo, Sam searches frantically. Above, the Eagles clash with the Nazgul in aerial combat. Gasping for breath, Sam races up the slopes of Mount Doom. Reaching the stone doorway of Sammath Naur, he staggers inside, flinching against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. Pressing forward towards an orange glow deep within the mountain, Sam endures the almost unbearable heat. There, he sees Frodo standing tensely on the edge of the Crack of Doom, a deep, lava-filled chasm in the heart of ancient Sauron's forges.\n\nFrodo, now a black silhouette against the raging orange glare, holds the Ring in his hand. Raising it over the bubbling lava far below, a strange expression crosses his face. The hum of the Ring grows louder and louder, and Frodo pulls the Ring close to his body, turning to Sam. With a look that reveals the Ring has finally taken him, Frodo slips the Ring onto his finger and vanishes, eliciting a scream from Sam.\n\nIn a storm of wings, the Nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards Mount Doom. In the midst of the battle, Gandalf realizes Frodo has been seen. Footprints move across the ash-covered cavern, and suddenly, Gollum smashes a rock down on Sam's head, knocking him to the ground. Gollum leaps onto the invisible Frodo, clawing frantically at his back.\n\nElsewhere on the battlefield, Aragorn is confronted by an armored troll wielding an enormous mallet. Meanwhile, Gollum, riding on the back of the invisible Frodo, suddenly lifts his hands to his face and bites down fiercely.",
    "356": "In a thunderous spectacle, the shrieking Nazgûl plummet from the sky, engulfed in flames, as the ground trembles so intensely that Frodo and Sam struggle to remain upright. Frodo falters, but Sam swiftly assists him. Despite their dire circumstances, Frodo manages a smile, his face serene with the burden of the Ring lifted. Together, they crawl onto a rock as a torrent of lava surges towards them, rapidly transforming their refuge into an island amidst a sea of molten rock. Frodo briefly shuts his eyes, then glances at Sam, who is weeping. Wrapping an arm around Sam's shoulder, they brace themselves as tiny, vulnerable figures awaiting their end in a catastrophic landscape, with lava erupting around them and fireballs raining from above.\n\nSlowly, the scene fades to black, only to reveal Gwaihir, the great eagle, soaring towards the camera, bearing Gandalf and accompanied by two more eagles. Undeterred by the ash and molten rocks, they valiantly snatch Frodo and Sam from the rock. As the fiery volcano retreats beneath him, Frodo's face is caressed by the wind before he loses consciousness.\n\nAwakening, Frodo's eyes flutter open and he spots Gandalf, whose face lights up with a smile. Laughter fills the air as Merry and Pippin rush in, embracing Frodo. Gimli and Legolas enter, their joy evident, followed by Aragorn, reuniting the Fellowship. Finally, Frodo's gaze falls upon Sam, standing apart. Their eyes meet in a profound, unspoken bond.\n\nThe scene sweeps over the restored walls of Minas Tirith, gleaming white under a blizzard of flower petals. Ascending to the courtyard, crowded with thousands, Gandalf places the glinting Crown of Gondor upon Aragorn's head. Aragorn rises, turning to the cheering crowd, and sings for his people. In a slow, respectful procession, he walks down the white path, passing Eowyn, Faramir, and Eomer, who bow before him. Trumpets sound as a procession of elves, led by Legolas, approach. Among them, Arwen, now mortal but deeply in love, carries the standard of Gondor bearing the white tree in full bloom. Aragorn kisses her, and they embrace as Elrond looks on, smiling. Together, Aragorn and Arwen approach four small, nervous figures standing at the path's end.\n\nThis vivid sequence captures the dramatic conclusion of Frodo and Sam's journey, the victorious restoration of Minas Tirith, and the joyous coronation of Aragorn as king, culminating in a heartfelt reunion with beloved companions.",
    "361": "In the hushed silence of a balcony overlooking the great city, Gandalf stands alone, his gaze sweeping the vast night sky. Nearby, Pippin, a young hobbit, is mesmerized by the distant, jagged mountains of Mordor. Gandalf watches Pippin intently before joining him, their eyes fixed on the fiery horizon. Pippin looks up at the wizard, his face etched with unease. Gandalf offers a small, self-deprecating smile, and they share a quiet moment of contemplation.\n\nMeanwhile, giant Mumakil, bearing armies on their backs, lumber across the landscape, and Corsair ships sail up the river. Gandalf's voice drops to a near-whisper, as if resigned to an impending doom. The battle-scarred city of Osgiliath, the last bastion between Minas Tirith and Mordor, stands as a grim reminder of the encroaching darkness. Pippin, desperate for reassurance, looks up at Gandalf, but the wizard remains silent, his gaze distant and introspective.\n\nIn the shadows, a towering, hooded figure dressed in black is being outfitted with armor by attendant orcs. Gandalf's stare is intense, as if he is confronting his enemy face-to-face. Pippin, afraid to ask about the ominous sight, looks up at the wizard with trepidation.\n\nElsewhere, Frodo screams as a Morgul blade pierces his shoulder, a memory that makes Pippin blanch. Frodo and Sam scramble into a small gully beside a rough-hewn road, with Gollum carefully peering over the edge. The looming city of Minas Morgul, a massive dead city glowing with a sickly luminescent light, sprawls before them. Two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge leading to the city. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum hurry from their cover, scampering through the shadows toward the eerie glow.\n\nFrodo and Sam stare in disbelief at a narrow, near-vertical staircase cut into the rock face, leading directly to the gates of Minas Morgul. As they ascend higher and higher up the sheer western side of the Morgul Valley, Frodo suddenly staggers across the road, compelled by an unseen force. He lurches toward the bridge and the gates of Minas Morgul. Sam runs after him, catching Frodo in his arms as he stumbles. Sam and Gollum pull Frodo away from the dangerous bridge, but Frodo collapses to the ground.\n\nAt that moment, the ground quivers, and a great rumbling noise rolls across the terrain, echoing in the mountains. The dull Morgul Valley erupts in violence and fury as uprushing flame springs from Mount Doom. Minas Morgul responds with a flare of vivid lightning, forks of blue flame springing up from the tower into the sullen cloud. Violent fiery flashes light the cloud above Mordor, and sharp thunder rolls across forty miles to Minas Tirith, portending the ominous battles to come.",
    "362": "In frightened awe, Pippin watches as Sam and Gollum guide Frodo toward the stairs. Above Minas Morgul, the sky blazes with light as the city erupts in chaos. The faces of soldiers and civilians in Minas Tirith are etched with concern as they observe from the city's parapets. Frodo and Sam collapse to the ground, covering their ears against a horrifying screech that emanates from the city. The piercing cry intensifies, rising to a deafening pitch before descending into a haunting wail and finally silencing. Frodo clutches his shirt as if it were ablaze, his eyes squeezed shut in terror.\n\nSuddenly, the cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a vast army pours forth. Rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs march swiftly and silently, passing near Frodo and Sam in an endless, ragged stream. An overwhelming force of 75,000 orcs marches to war, just below where Frodo, Sam, and Gollum begin their ascent up the stony stairs, towering high above the marching army.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf is deep in thought, calculating their next move. With unyielding determination, he strides through the city's back streets, his pace so swift that Pippin struggles to keep up. Abruptly, Gandalf stops and turns to Pippin, kneeling down to look him earnestly in the eyes, his hand resting on Pippin's shoulder. As Pippin hurries away, Gandalf watches him go, his expression thoughtful.\n\nElsewhere, an ancient stone bridge spans the ruins of East and West Osgiliath, a once-mighty Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge, the western portion of which has fallen into disrepair. The desolation of East Osgiliath is even more pronounced, held firmly by the forces of Mordor. Beneath the bridge, dark waters catch stealthy movements as countless boats, carrying menacing orcs, silently track down the river. Hunched figures steer the vessels with long oars, their intentions sinister.\n\nFaramir, Captain of Gondor, issues orders to his soldiers as the Ithilien Rangers take their positions, their weathered faces and hardened demeanors reflecting their seasoned professionalism. Watchful and ready, they wait as the boats quietly advance on the river. As the orcs reach the shore, hundreds race ashore, led by Faramir with his sword drawn. A fierce battle ensues, but Faramir is unable to halt the orcs' relentless advance as they cross the wide bridge into West Osgiliath.\n\nHigh above, Pippin desperately scrambles up a rocky mountainside, the dizzying view of Minas Tirith sprawling 1,000 feet below. He clambers over a rocky ledge and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. On an ancient stone ledge, a great pile of firewood lies secured in stacked bundles. With stealth, Pippin manages to pour oil on the wood and set it ablaze. Within seconds, the great pyre is alight, the flames erupting into the twilight sky as the guards look on in total surprise. Tensely waiting below, Gandalf watches the scene unfold.",
    "368": "In the quiet of night, young Don Price points his flashlight at Edward, illuminating him in the stark beam. Previously, Edward has consistently outperformed Don in football, baseball, and basketball, a fact that has left Edward stunned and disbelieving. With a surge of resolve, Edward turns and descends the front steps, leaving behind a sorority sister who lingers in the doorway, feeling a pang of guilt. Eventually, she retreats inside. The camera follows Edward as he walks away, tears welling up in his eyes, until he disappears from view, leaving only the sorority house visible. Moments later, Edward re-enters the frame, gazing back at the house. As he shouts, the camera circles around him, capturing his anguish. Inside, Sandra and her sorority sisters watch through the curtains, unnoticed.\n\nIn the bland lecture hall, a tweedy economics professor drones on, oblivious that he has switched on the overhead projector displaying a embarrassing image. A classmate nudges Sandra, drawing her attention to the spectacle. The professor remains clueless, even as a titter runs through the students. Later, Sandra walks across campus, shaking her head in disbelief as she looks up to see a giant sky-written heart floating in the blue sky.\n\nThe next morning, prompted by her sisters, Sandra rubs her sleepy eyes and looks out the second-story window to find the lawn covered in a sea of flowers. Standing amidst the blooms is Edward. Sandra ventures out to meet him, her face a mix of smiles, confusion, joy, and fear. A single tear trails down her cheek.\n\nSuddenly, the adult Don Price arrives on the scene, 230 pounds of muscle, fueled by anger. Flanked by his fraternity brothers, Don viciously attacks Edward, knocking him down. Edward rises but doesn't fight back. Unfazed, Don strikes again and proceeds to beat Edward mercilessly. Meanwhile, in a grimy restroom, Don Price is seated, straining uncomfortably. Suddenly, he clutches his chest and collapses, face-first on the tile, an image reflected in an eerie eye.\n\nBack at the fight, Edward struggles to his feet, bracing for more punishment. But as Don is about to strike again, Sandra intervenes, pulling off her engagement ring. A chorus of \"ahh\" and \"ohh\" erupts from the onlooking sisters and brothers. Don freezes, stunned. Edward, barely able to see through his swollen eyes, awaits the next blow. Instead, Sandra places the ring in Don's hand. A beat passes, and Don storms off. Sandra rushes to Edward's side, his broken body lying on a bed of daffodils. As the music swells, the scene abruptly shifts. Later, as Edward reaches for his glass of water, Josephine is already extending it to him, her assistance a silent affirmation of their bond.",
    "373": "In the quiet town of Spectre, a young Jenny Hill watches as barefoot Edward departs from her home for the first time, finally recognizing who he is. Before Edward can utter another word, he pulls the door shut behind him, only for it to break off in his hands. Jenny, startled and irritated, watches from inside as Edward struggles to fix the door. His attempts to prop it back up fail miserably; the door frame warps, the shack groans, and eventually, the door crashes down onto a small table, smashing it. Karl steps in, pushing the house back into place.\n\nEdward takes on the task of renovating Jenny's home, installing new windows with nails held between his lips, and even adding a white picket fence that exudes an impossibly charming allure. Inside, he meticulously screws a hat rack into the foyer wall, while Jenny leans against the doorframe, listening intently to his stories, her eyes filled with deep affection. With his work complete, Edward takes his hat from a chair and hangs it on the rack—a perfect fit. Their eyes meet in a lingering gaze.\n\nWith no more tasks to keep him there, Edward knows it's time to leave. Jenny approaches, taking his hand, and lifts his hat to the peg. She stands just a breath away from a kiss, but Edward gently holds her back. Jenny pulls away, frozen in a mix of shock and humiliation. Hastily, she finds a pen and signs the deed to the house, handing it to Edward with a final look of gratitude before he departs.\n\nEdward takes one last glance at the idyllic little town before climbing into his car and starting the engine. As he drives away, the swamp begins to reclaim the house, enveloping it in vines and mossy branches. Shoots burst through the porch planks, and snakes slither through the marsh as day turns into night.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Jenny sit at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them. Will smiles at something Jenny says, but she becomes increasingly agitated by her silence. Will's thoughts swirl as he turns to see his wife at a payphone, realizing she was trying to call him. He half-smiles, acknowledging the futility of his question about his father's condition.\n\nAt the hospital, Dr. Bennett checks Edward's chart with a smile, the ambient sounds of the hospital filling the air. After a long silence, Dr. Bennett pats Will's shoulder and leaves. Will stays with his father for a while before taking out a pen and beginning to make a list.",
    "375": "In the heart of a seemingly idyllic landscape, a man named Edward stands out, not just for his handsome features or charming demeanor, but as if nature itself had conspired to create a masterpiece. Suddenly, Edward plunges his hands into the water, pulling up a catfish and gazing intently into its eyes. After a moment, the fish—nicknamed \"Beast\"—spits out Edward's gold ring.\n\nMeanwhile, in a mostly empty apartment with half-unpacked boxes and a cradle still in its carton, a phone rings insistently, its European tone cutting through the sound of rain. Keys jangle in the lock, and laughter echoes from the hallway as the door swings open. Will, a drenched 29-year-old, juggles four soggy grocery bags, while his wife Josephine, 28, rushes past him to answer the phone. She hands it to Will, her concern evident. Half-undressed, Will takes the call, knowing instinctively that the news won't be good. He covers the mouthpiece and looks at Josephine, a silent exchange passing between them.\n\nLater, Will and Josephine are on a plane, seated side by side in coach. Josephine applies hand lotion as the cabin lights dim, and passengers drift off to sleep. Josephine leans against Will, her hands tucked under her belly. Will notices a bored boy in the next row, entertaining himself by casting shadow puppets on the seat back. The boy's hands morph into a bird, a monkey, and finally a dog. As the silhouettes dance, the scene shifts to a younger Will, seated on the floor in his pajamas, watching Edward make similar shadow shapes. Edward ensures his wife is out of earshot before leaning in, eager to share a forbidden story with young Will.\n\nUnder the cover of night, alive with whirring sounds and low-hanging moonlight, five kids traverse a dark path, flashlights sweeping the ground. The fifth child stumbles, bumping into young Edward. They approach a spooky house, where Edward hands his flashlight to Zacky and scales the gate, despite his fear. Dropping down on the other side, Edward presses on, determined to face whatever lies ahead.",
    "377": "Will tentatively approaches the room, letting his fingers trail along the wallpaper as he walks. He pauses briefly at the door to gather his composure before entering. Inside, Edward Bloom, a 61-year-old man, lies asleep on the bed. Though his once vibrant aura has diminished, his condition is not as dire as anticipated. His rapid illness has mercifully left him largely unscathed, with no intrusive medical equipment around.\n\nWill steps up to the bed, and Edward stirs, opening an eye and struggling to focus. He attempts to speak, but his voice fails him. His gaze shifts to a pitcher on the nightstand, and Will pours him some water, gently helping him drink. A tense silence ensues, with Will nearly speaking to fill the void. Remembering a can of Ensure, he holds it up, but Edward recoils, rolling his eyes before reluctantly drinking through a straw. Edward pushes the can away after managing to drink some, swallowing with evident difficulty. Will remains noncommittal to Edward's assessment of his condition.\n\nA small laugh escapes Edward, turning into a cough that escalates into a hacking fit. Will quickly offers more water to help him regain control. As Will leaves the room, he takes the half-empty Ensure with him, drinking the rest himself and grimacing at the awful taste.\n\nMoving towards the stairs, Will passes an open door, revealing a scene from his past. Inside, a young Will, around eight years old, is propped up in bed, his face covered in chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He sings with a high, thin voice that suddenly cracks and drops mid-octave, causing him to blush. Edward, singing along, tugs at his collar as it becomes tighter. Buttons pop off rapidly, one hitting a nearby woman. Edward's pants cuffs rise visibly as he grows at an astonishing rate.\n\nIn another scene, young Edward lies in bed, connected to pulleys and levers to support his growing limbs. Surrounded by encyclopedias, he studies intently. Meanwhile, the crack of a bat signals a game-winning home run, with the crowd cheering wildly for the batter—a grown-up Edward Bloom, now a young man in his prime, whom we will follow through the coming years.",

Meanwhile, Walter drives, his eyes fixed on the road, listening to the Dude's speech, which is occasionally interrupted by yaps from the back seat. Walter's attention shifts as the car slows down, and the Dude follows his gaze.\n\nWalter pulls the car up the driveway, and he and the Dude step out, their eyes fixed on the front lawn. Suddenly, a loud bang echoes as the Dude and Walter push through double doors. A man in a wheelchair hums as he spins around, crossing to Lebowski. Walter, moving from behind, hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits and shoves him forward, causing him to crumple to the floor, weeping. The Dude and Walter stand watching, the dog yapping in the background.\n\nQuintana bellows from the edge of the lane, restrained by O'Brien. Walter looks on innocently, making hip-grinding motions as O'Brien leads Quintana away. Walter and the Dude, their heads cocked and peeking over shades, watch him go. Later, Donny, Walter, and the Dude emerge from an alley, each carrying a leatherette ball satchel. The men in black, stunned, confer in German. Walter ignores the Dude and addresses the Germans directly. Donny appears visibly frightened as Walter's eyes burn with hatred, locked on Dieter's.\n\nThe Dude digs into his pocket, speaking louder to the Germans as he searches his wallet. With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. In a rage, Dieter charges, but he is caught off-guard. The Dude hurls his leather satchel, and the bowling ball thuds into Dieter's chest, lifting him off his feet. Dieter drops the saber, and the Dude twists away, grabbing Dieter's head in both hands. He draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, closing his jaws on Dieter's ear.\n\nThe Dude rushes Franz but stops short as Franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping. Still clamping onto Dieter's ear, the Dude awkwardly circles, evading Franz's kicks. With a tearing sound, the Dude's head and Dieter's separate. Growling as Dieter screams, the Dude worries the ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped. Franz gives a loud cry with each kick, and the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up to evade the kicks.\n\nPanting, the Dude rises and trots over as Donny gasps for air. The Dude runs into the lanes, and Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder. The tense scene concludes with a mix of aggression and camaraderie, setting the stage for the next sequence of events.",

He unconsciously runs his tongue over his lips, faint bowling sounds echoing in the distance. Beside him lies a cassette case marked \"VENICE,\" resting in his open hand.\n\nSuddenly, the Dude's eyes flutter open as a blonde woman appears above him. Nearby, a young man in paint-splattered jeans swings something towards them. A burst of stars fills the Dude's vision, and he finds himself soaring over the city, arms outstretched, the wind rushing through his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. Ahead, the enigmatic blonde woman speeds away, standing on the Dude's rug as if it were a magic carpet. She pulls ahead, diminishing in size as the Dude looks up.\n\nMid-flight, the Dude performs a few lazy swimming strokes and notices a bowling ball has inexplicably appeared in his hand. His puzzlement shifts to alarm as he considers the aerodynamic consequences. The ball's weight drags his arm down, sending him into a sudden descent.

Fergus examines her, his concern growing. He shook her gently, but as her eyes slowly open, his alarm turns into relief.\n\nInside the flat, Fergus carries Dil in, propping her against the wall before checking the street from the window. Dil takes a hearty swig of whiskey and weakly gestures towards a cabinet in the bathroom. Fergus retrieves pills for her. She takes another drink, wanders around the room, and finally sits, holding the bottle tightly between her knees, gazing vacantly. When Fergus moves towards the door, Dil stands, her eyes locking onto him. There's an undeniable allure about her. He approaches cautiously and kisses her. A photograph of a smiling soldier watches over them.\n\nDil, enveloped in a sweet, drug-induced haze, reaches out to stroke Fergus's hand. He sits on the bed beside her as she continues to caress his hand, her voice a dreamy slur, eyes distant. She smiles softly, attempting a lazy swat at him, her hand unsteady. Fergus tenderly strokes her cheek. She murmurs slowly and sleepily, her eyes fluttering closed as she drifts into a deep slumber. Fergus gazes at her almost fondly before they both rest fully clothed on the bed.\n\nDil awakens and quietly searches Fergus's coat, retrieving his gun. Meanwhile, Jude's alarm sounds, and she begins her morning routine. Dil secures silk stockings to each corner of the brass bed, gently binding Fergus's feet. As she tightens the final stocking, he awakens, startled. She speaks in an eerily quiet voice as Jude, now fully dressed, slips a gun into her handbag and leaves, spotted by the judge's figure in the window.\n\nFergus stares at Dil, trying to loosen his bindings, but she stands, gun pointed at him.

The judge's security detail revs up their car, preparing for a swift departure. Suddenly, Maguire bursts from his vehicle, darting across the street, gun in hand. The judge's goon spots Maguire and reacts, but Maguire fires, hitting the judge who collapses to the ground. The goon, struck in the arm, retaliates with an Uzi, creating a chaotic scene as more armed men emerge from the car. Jude quickly accelerates away as the gunfight ensues, leaving Maguire mortally wounded.\n\nInside a dimly lit room, Dil, dressed in a soldier's cricket attire, approaches Fergus. She appears as a sweet, innocent boy, but her intentions are unclear. Pointing a gun at Fergus, she weeps uncontrollably. Suddenly, she sets the gun gently on his chest and begins to free him from his bindings. The wail of police sirens fills the air as Dil, emotionally overwhelmed, sits close to Fergus. He manages to free one arm and tenderly strokes her hair as she shudders with sobs. The melancholic melody of a song softly plays in the background.\n\nWithout warning, Jude storms into the room, gun raised, only to be met by Dil's swift reaction. Dil fires, striking Jude who crumples to the floor, writhing. Dil steps closer, her gun aimed at Jude as the injured woman desperately reaches for her own weapon. Dil shoots again, this time striking Jude's shoulder, sending her spinning. Fergus screams in horror as Dil relentlessly fires, finally delivering a fatal shot to Jude’s throat, leaving her lifeless in a pool of blood.\n\nDil then turns the gun on Fergus, her finger trembling on the trigger. She pauses, conflicted, before turning her attention to a nearby picture. Sitting in front of it, she raises the gun to her mouth. Fergus, acting swiftly, gently removes the gun and places it on the table. He lifts her by the shoulders, leading her out of the room. He returns momentarily to glance out the window, where he sees Dil staggering through the gathered crowds, revealing the tumultuous aftermath of the night's events.",
    "404": "In the throes of a heated argument, a woman storms back into the room, gathering various items scattered about. She furiously hurls them out the window: an assortment of men's clothes, leather trousers, a suitcase, and even a teddy bear come crashing down. Below, a man stands in the street, his arms filled with his discarded belongings, a pitiful image of rejection. The barrage continues as Dil seizes a large goldfish bowl and sends it plummeting down. It shatters on the pavement, leaving goldfish flopping helplessly in the street. With a final glance, Dil slams the window shut.\n\nInside, the tension between Dil and Fergus is palpable. She hands him a glass, and as he sits down, his eyes dart between her and a nearby photograph. An unspoken understanding passes between them, and they find solace in each other's arms. Their embrace escalates, becoming a passionate and intense interlude. The photograph of Jody, hanging above them, seems to bear witness, its eyes burning into Fergus. As abruptly as it began, Dil pulls away, only to return, unbuttoning his shirt and exploring his chest with her mouth. Fergus, torn between his desires and the haunting gaze of Jody, attempts to draw her back up, but Dil takes control, her hands expertly undoing his pants. She kisses his stomach, her mouth trailing down his body, as Fergus remains fixated on Jody's piercing stare, tears welling up in his eyes.\n\nIn the quiet aftermath, Dil sits before a mirror, her reflection gazing back at her. Fergus, standing behind her, tenderly brushes the hair from her face, and she leans into his embrace. As he leaves, she remains seated, reapplying her lipstick, her thoughts her own.\n\nLater, a singer in a blue dress performs as Dil and Fergus stand by the bar, drinks with tiny umbrellas in hand. Dave, conspicuous in his neck brace, approaches but steps back, watching as Fergus takes Dil's arm. The woman on stage sings soulfully, while Dil and Fergus draw closer, their cheeks pressed together. Dave, sulking at the bar, slams his drink down and stands to leave as the act concludes. Back at the bar, Dil and Fergus are served by Col, the jovial barman. Dil throws back her drink in one swift gulp, takes the bottle, and refills their glasses. She downs hers again, tilting Fergus's glass back so he follows suit.\n\nEventually, Dil enters another room, Fergus trailing slowly behind her. His gaze wanders from the cricket whites peeking out from behind a curtain to the photographs adorning the walls, each one a silent testament to the complex tapestry of their lives.",
    "406": "Fergus spots Dil through the window gap, seated in the lift. As she passes a wall opening, she blows him a playful kiss. He exits the room, navigating around the scaffolding, only to be greeted by Dil's wave. She takes a seat on some bricks, opening a hamper. Despite himself, Fergus smiles as she pours him tea from a thermos. She lowers her gaze, and he tenderly removes her glasses, revealing her moist eyes. Abruptly, Fergus stands up, leaving Deveroux staring, suddenly chilled. Looking down at Dil, Fergus offers his arm, which she takes after gathering her belongings, her face lit up with a smile. He guides her down the scaffolding ramp, and they descend in the lift, which halts with a jolt. Leaning in, Dil kisses Fergus, but a chorus of catcalls from behind him interrupts the moment. He watches her leave as the lift ascends back to the site.\n\nLater, Fergus waits outside the hair salon. Inside, Dil removes her smock, walking towards him with all the girls smiling in the background. She takes his arm, and they depart together. A car follows them, causing Fergus to turn around. They reach her door just as the car stops. Fergus steals a kiss, gazing at her open lips in disbelief. She enters her home, leaving Fergus to return to his room, where he turns on a small desk-light. Hearing a voice, he finds Jude sitting in the corner, her hair now dark brown. Staring at her, he remains silent as she prowls around the room. She lies beside him, removes a black leather glove, and places her hand on his crotch. He promptly moves her hand away, and she fixes him with a hard look. Leaping from the bed, Fergus is drawn into a tense moment as Jude presses her lips to his, then forcefully pulls his head back by his hair. She brandishes a gun, sticking it between his teeth. Fergus stares at her, uttering quiet words, and she kisses him briefly, the gun still at his temple, before departing. He is left standing in the darkness.\n\nNext, Fergus approaches the hair salon, flowers in hand. He watches from outside, concealing the bouquet behind his back. As the chair turns, it reveals Jude instead of Dil. Fergus freezes, witnessing Jude's bright smile as she talks to Dil. Suddenly, Jude turns in the chair, her smile directed at something behind him. He turns to find Jude present once more. Startled, Fergus stands up, tosses money on the table, seizes her arm, and forcefully escorts her out.",
    "419": "As the game concludes, Bert is already waiting in the front room, seated at a table with a drink in hand. He watches as Eddie walks past, heading towards the bar. Eddie casts a glance at Bert, who, amused, joins him at the bar. Bert signals the bartender for another round, laughter echoing as he begins to leave. Eddie exits shortly after, the sound of a ship's horn resonating in the background.\n\nEddie traverses the piers and warehouses, approaching a small waterfront dive called Arthur's Pool Hall. The atmosphere inside is thick and oppressive, with a few lonely dockworkers hunched over their beers at the bar. In the back, a pool table stands, where two burly men watch a pale, skinny young man line up his shot. They exchange glances, silently sizing each other up. The young man takes his shot, sinking the ball with ease.\n\nEddie steps over to the rack, selecting a cue for himself. One of the other players is putting his cue away. The young man makes his break shot, slamming the nine ball into the pocket, and looks up at Eddie with a snide grin. The two men who lost stand silently, observing the game. Eddie tosses a coin onto the table, collecting it as the young man racks up the balls. Preparing to break, Eddie chalks his cue, then forcefully drives the cue ball into the pack. The nine ball drops into the pocket, leaving everyone stunned, especially the young man.\n\nEddie's control falters as he begins to shoot with the same precision he had at Ames, each shot rapping in with perfect control. He remains oblivious to the growing circle of men gathered around, their faces glowering. Eddie sinks a series of tough shots—tricky combinations and more—culminating in a final combination shot. The young man nervously digs into his jacket for the money, all eyes fixed on Eddie. Sensing the impending danger, the young man quickly pays up, sets down his cue, drops the cash on the table, and hastily leaves.\n\nA thick-fleshed, obscene-looking man named Turk steps forward, his mouth twisted into a mock smile. Eddie's fury turns to fear as he glances around at the circle of silent, glaring men. He nervously wipes his mouth with his sleeve and attempts to back away, but there is nowhere to go. Turk takes the bills from the table and stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. The men drag Eddie into the men's room, shoving him up against the ground-glass partition.",
    "420": "The film opens with a man's cheek pressed against a glass, the foggy silhouettes of others looming behind him. Suddenly, Eddie screams horribly, his mouth agape, and screams again. His arms are released, and he crumples to the floor. The bartender, unfazed, returns to the bar as the ship's horn blares again.\n\nA knock echoes at a door. Inside, Sarah sits alone in her darkened room, clad in a robe and slip, lost in a drunken stupor. She stirs, eyes puffy and face glistening with sweat, and opens the door. Standing there is Eddie, leaning against the wall, arms tucked into his chest, one hand covering the other. Stunned, Sarah moves to him, enveloping him in her arms as he begins to cry. She holds him tight. Later, Sarah watches Eddie, his hands now in plaster casts, trying to sleep, his arms twitching as if to defend himself. She rises, joined him, and strokes his head gently.\n\nThe next morning, they sit at the breakfast table. Sarah pours Eddie some coffee, but he struggles to bring the cup to his lips, eventually dropping it to the floor in disgust. He storms off, leaving Sarah to patiently clean the spilled coffee.\n\nTime passes, and the apartment is now clean and neat, Sarah sober. She types away at her table while Eddie stands at the window, trying to scratch his back. He approaches the table, using his mouth to pluck a cigarette from the pack. He glances at Sarah, then at the sheet in the typewriter. She lights the cigarette for him. He begins to unbutton his shirt, hesitating briefly before allowing Sarah to help. She unbuttons his shirt, and he takes her face in his hands, kissing her tenderly.\n\nThey emerge from the doorway on a warm, beautiful day, Sarah carrying a basket. Eddie seems carefree, almost forgetting the casts on his hands. They stop at a scenic spot overlooking the river, spreading out a blanket. Eddie leans back on the grass, looking at Sarah. They share a moment of ease and relaxation under the sunshine. Eddie lowers his eyes, leaning back, and just stares at her, content. The film closes as Eddie is about to knock on the door to Sarah's apartment.",
    "424": "Bert settles into his seat as Findley, wearing a mischievous grin, produces a cloth bag and empties it, sending three billiard balls rolling onto the table. Eddie takes his shot, his red ball bouncing off the shoulder and gently tapping the third ball. Findley then steps away to the bar, leaving Bert and Eddie to themselves. He gestures towards a statue resting on a table behind the couch—a figurine of Pan, complete with horns protruding from its curly head and the legs of a goat. After completing his shot, Findley lays his cue on the table and heads to the bar. Eddie, now without his coat, anxiously rubs his hand while Bert turns away from him to join Findley. Eddie stands momentarily helpless before Findley pours a drink as he approaches. Eddie reaches into his pocket, only to recall he gave his money to Sarah.\n\nIn a hurried rush, Eddie dashes upstairs, bursting into the room and past Sarah, who is lying on the bed. He grabs money from her purse. Though she faces away, her eyes are open, listening intently as he slams the door behind him. Eddie bounds down the stairs, taking them two at a time. Bert greets him with a controlled, rage-filled stare as they prepare to resume their game.\n\nJust as a game concludes, Sarah descends the stairs quietly, pausing to listen at the rail. Bert relaxes with his shoes propped on the couch while Eddie turns and spots her. His eyes squeeze shut, fists clenched against his temples in apparent anguish. A stunned Eddie moves back to the billiard table. Defeated, Sarah turns and heads back upstairs. The men return to their game, Bert donning his coat with deep satisfaction, ready to observe. A shaken Findley slumps into a leather swivel chair, a bucket of iced champagne awaiting on the desk. He puffs on his cigarette, gazing at Bert, who slouches across from him, impatience etched on his face. Eddie leans silently against a nearby wall, visibly morose.\n\nEddie eventually moves to leave, Findley and Bert watching him go. Outside, Eddie waits for Bert to come down the stairs before abruptly turning and walking out of the house. Bert, after a moment's hesitation, follows. Upon entering his suite, Bert removes his overcoat and eyes the door separating his room from Sarah's. Uncertain, he pours and swiftly downs a drink, then walks to the door. Listening briefly, he opens it without knocking. Inside, Sarah sits primly on the bed.",
    "425": "In the quietude of her hotel suite, Sarah sits with a drink in hand and a packed suitcase by her side. Suddenly, Bert enters, confronting her with a stern demeanor. Sarah responds with a voice that is both subdued and controlled, her emotions tightly leashed. Bert looms over her, producing a thick wad of bills from his pocket. In a brash move, he tries to kiss her, but she remains unresponsive and limp in his arms. He releases her, and she falls back onto the bed as he turns and retreats to his own room.\n\nAfter a moment, Sarah takes a cigarette from a pack, rises, and follows Bert into his room. The mirror in the bathroom reveals Bert asleep on his disheveled bed. Sarah, clad in her slip, enters the bathroom and shuts the door firmly behind her.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie returns to the hotel, breezing past a uniformed policeman in the lobby and stopping at the front desk. The concierge, staring blankly, hands him something before Eddie swiftly heads toward the elevators. Upon entering the suite, he finds money scattered on Sarah's bed. Putting down his cue case, he turns to see a commotion in the adjoining room. Bert lies in bed, speaking to a plainclothes detective who is diligently taking notes, while a photographer stands ready with a flash camera near the bathroom.\n\nBert notices Eddie through the open door, but a uniformed policeman initially bars his entrance. Eddie manages to enter, surveying the detectives around Bert's bed. The photographer's flash illuminates the room as he captures an image of the bathroom. Eddie pushes past the photographer, only to halt in shock at the sight of Sarah's body on the tiled floor. He drops to his knees beside her, reaching out to touch her before pulling his hand back.\n\nBehind him, Bert appears at the bathroom door, his words causing Eddie to clench his eyes shut in anguish. Suddenly, Eddie lunges at Bert, grasping him by the throat and pushing him back. A policeman intervenes, but Eddie quickly breaks free.\n\nElsewhere, Minnesota Fats sits engrossed in the afternoon paper, while Big John practices shots at a pool table. Bert, wearing dark glasses, stands near the cashier's cage, idly chucking dice into a leather shaker, the sound echoing through the slow, gloomy afternoon at Ames. When Bert spots Eddie entering, he recoils fearfully, signaling his men for protection. Eddie, with his cue case tucked under his arm, walks straight toward Bert before stopping and staring at him intently. Then, turning away, Eddie approaches Minnesota Fats, who rises, ready for a game. Eddie methodically screws his cue together, ready to join Fats at the table.",
    "426": "**The Hustler**\n\nUnder the dim lights of Ames Pool Hall, a tense atmosphere lingers as the balls are racked and ready for a high-stakes game. Willie collects the bets and prepares to flip a coin, determining who will break. Spectators, including Preacher and Big John, gather around the table, while Bert keeps a cautious distance, positioning himself near the coat rack. Willie gives Minnesota Fats the nod; it's his break. Without hesitation, Fats leans over and sends the cue ball gliding down the table, scattering the racked balls with a solid break.\n\nEddie Felson, cue in hand, analyzes the table before abruptly walking away to the washroom. Glancing at Bert, he dusts his hands with chalk and seizes his cue. With swift determination, Eddie executes a powerful bank shot, sinking the one ball and dispersing the rest. The crowd erupts in applause as Eddie swiftly lines up his next shot, casually conversing with Bert. Meanwhile, Fats and Bert exchange subtle glances, and Fats, cigarette dangling from his lips, awaits his turn.\n\nBert fidgets in his seat as the sharp knock of pool balls echoes through the hall. Eddie's precise shots find their targets one after another, a mix of straightforward and tricky angles. Bert and Fats grow increasingly uneasy as Eddie circles the table, commanding it like a hawk zeroing in on its prey. When Fats finally gets his chance, he removes his jacket and loosens his tie, but his concentration is broken. He chalks his cue, takes aim, and misses a difficult shot.\n\nEddie, unfazed, steps up and continues his streak, sinking shot after shot with quick, accurate precision. Fats slumps in his seat, drink in hand, watching Eddie's relentless performance as the clock strikes six. Eddie, finished with his triumphant display, packs up his cue and slips into his jacket, assisted by Preacher. Bert's bodyguards stand at the ready, but Bert halts their advance with a simple gesture. He attempts a friendly smile, but the tension in the room remains palpable.\n\nEddie pauses, casting a final glance at Bert and the dejected Minnesota Fats before exiting the pool hall. As the door swings shut behind him, Ames gradually returns to its normal, lively state. Fats silently puts on his coat, while Henry begins to sweep the floor. Bert resumes his throne-like seat, glass of milk in hand, overseeing the establishment as the reigning king of Ames.",
    "429": "The room echoes with intensifying applause as the billiard balls glide into their respective pockets. Eddie, radiating pride and excitement, basks in the admiration of Ames' sharks. He confidently puts down his chalk and retreats to his seat. Meanwhile, Fats, rising slowly from his chair, grudgingly hands over the money to Charlie. The clock ticks towards four in the morning. Fats, after a moment's hesitation, retrieves more bills from his pocket. Both men stand, shed their jackets, and gear up for another round.\n\nPreacher enters the back room, clutching a paper bag filled with clinking bottles. Six men sit engrossed in a poker game around a table. He leans in to whisper hurriedly to one of them—Bert Gordon. Bert, dressed conservatively with dark glasses, could pass for a businessman enjoying a night out, sipping milk to ease an ulcer. He nods to Preacher, who then exits. Bert pauses thoughtfully, rises, and takes a sip of his milk.\n\nBack in the billiard room, the floor around Charlie’s chair is littered with cigarette butts. Charlie stubs out another cigarette and immediately reaches for more. Eddie drains the last drops from his bottle of bourbon, his eyes meeting Bert's watchful gaze. Eddie misses his shot, yet he eagerly jumps out of his seat, eager to continue his winning streak. Bert sighs softly as the next shot sinks in. Fats opens a fresh bottle of whisky, and the game persists.\n\nThe clock hands spin towards eight in the morning. The room is now nearly empty, save for the players and a few employees. As Fats lines up his next shot, Henry draws the Venetian blinds. Bert, visibly unsettled by Fats' composure, holds a hand to his temple. There’s a pause in the action. Fats and Eddie exchange cold glares, each clutching their drinks. Eddie takes a swig and returns to the game. Bert hands Charlie more money, then carefully replaces his billfold.\n\nEddie, now weary, looks up at Bert's cool, impassive face. Bert shifts his chair slightly. Another shot sinks. Eddie goes to the water cooler for a drink while Fats counts out his losses on the table. Eddie stands before Fats and Bert, awaiting a response. Fats and Bert exchange glances but remain silent, showing no sign of concession. Eddie starts to return to his chair but suddenly turns back, wearing a weary, clowning smile.",
    "436": "In the bustling restroom of a lively bar, an attendant offers Don a towel, his hands dripping. The attendant's gaze fixates on Don's lapel, bewilderment etched on his face. Don tosses him a fifty-cent piece, a playful joke that sails over the attendant's head, but he chuckles anyway, swinging the door open to the vibrant bar scene. Don ambles from the washroom, his steps measured, but halts mid-stride, sensing a shift in the room. Every pair of eyes is locked onto him; the pianist, the waiters, even the amorous couples nestled by the little piano—all stare in his direction. Abruptly, M.M.'s escort is upon him, grasping his coat. Don retrieves a bag concealed within, but it's swiftly snatched away, a bill held out in vain as his remaining money is pilfered.\n\nThe waiter deftly pockets the cash, and before Don knows it, he's propelled towards the door. A hat is fetched and unceremoniously plopped onto his head as the bouncer drags him out, delivering a final shove down the street. Don stumbles to a halt, leaning against an iron railing, his hand wiping the humiliation from his face. He glanced back at the gawking doorman and taxi drivers, straightens his disheveled appearance, and begins the arduous trek home, every step laden with shame.\n\nThe street is a blaze of light and laughter, a stark contrast to the dimly lit doorway he eventually reaches. The familiar sights—newspaper, milk bottle, Helen's note—remain untouched as he drags himself inside. The corridor light flicks on automatically, revealing the unchanged tableau. Don collapses onto the living room couch, his face buried in his arms, a stupor of shame and misery engulfing him. Tears streak down his face, but as he brushes them away, something catches his eye, coaxing a half-crazed smile to his lips.\n\nOn the ceiling, a telltale shadow betrays the bottle stashed within the light fixture. A burst of nervous laughter escapes him as he summons the strength to stand. With renewed determination, he pulls the coffee table under the light, stacks a chair atop it, and climbs, retrieving his hidden treasure. Back on solid ground, he wrests the bottle open, a fierce resolve in his grasp.\n\nMorning finds Don stirring, his eyes fluttering open slowly. He rises, steadying himself on the bedpost, using the door frame for support as he emerges from the bedroom, ready to face the day.",
    "440": "In a dimly-lit store, a man's piercing gaze, filled with murderous intent, captivates the proprietor. Without a word, the man takes a bottle from a shelf, the spellbound owner merely handing it over. The man, Don, strides out, bottle in hand.\n\n Entering his disorderly apartment, Don's gaze sweeps across the chaos, grimacing at the lights left on. He turns them off, then slumps into his favorite chair. Three empty bottles litter the table beside him; he adds a fourth from his pocket, twisting it open. Behind him, a telephone rings insistently, but he ignores it, sweeping the empty bottles onto the floor. Pouring a generous drink, he raises his glass, obscuring his face as he succumbs to the night's oblivion.\n\nWaking in a stupor, Don stares blankly ahead, the bottle beside him nearly depleted. A slight movement catches his eye—a small mouse peeks from a hole in the plaster, its friendly demeanor coaxing a half-smile from Don. Suddenly, a bat swoops in, its wing grazing Don's forehead as it attacks the mouse. Don recoils, frozen in horror as the bat envelops the tiny creature, a hideous struggle ensuing beneath its wings. Blood spurts, and Don screams in terror, hiding his eyes.\n\nHis cries alert a neighbor; Sophie stands barking beside her, and even Mrs. Deveridge's dog barks from downstairs. The neighbor's door is open, and footsteps pound up the stairs towards Don's door, the bell ringing urgently: short, short, long, short.

    "435": "In the opening moments, Don's gaze shifts towards the window while his companion, Wick, stands with his back to him, busy packing a suitcase. Don hurriedly gathers more clothes from a chest of drawers, his movements tense and hurried. He watches Wick warily as Wick moves into the living room, leaving Don alone to execute his secretive actions swiftly. With a sudden burst of speed, Don grabs a sweater and rushes to the window, where he retrieves a hidden whiskey bottle, concealing it within the sweater. His nervously fumbling hands struggle to untie a string around the bottle’s neck, wasting precious seconds. The commotion from the living room continues as Wick searches through a closet. Realizing time is running out, Don lowers the bottle back against the wall just as Wick re-enters the room, carrying a stack of white papers.\n\nFeigning calm, Don bends down to peer under the bed. Wick places an old Remington portable typewriter into Don's suitcase and moves towards the door as a distinctive ringing pattern begins—short, short, long, short. From the bedroom, Don watches as Wick opens the door to reveal a breathless Helen, who enters with a determined stride. It is indeed Helen, a vibrant and attractive twenty-six-year-old, clad in a leopard coat too warm for the Indian Summer day, but cherished nonetheless. She carries packages wrapped neatly in her hands.\n\nHelen and Don share a familiar, playful moment as she places her packages in the suitcase. Don leans in for a kiss on the cheek, and as their faces draw near, a flicker of emotion crosses Don's eyes. Wick, observing the exchange, casts a suspicious glance at Helen before discarding his cigarette out the window. Unnoticed by the trio, the cigarette rebounds off the window frame and smolders on the sill. Don, filled with furious anxiety, retrieves a bunch of keys from his pocket, his eyes catching the smoldering cigarette.\n\nWick turns away and approaches the window. Don, restrained by Helen, watches Wick with rising tension. Wick flicks the cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back when his eyes land on a cleat and string by the window. He leans out to investigate, prompting Helen to sense the growing unease, her glance darting between the two brothers. Don, his eyes wide with panic, releases Helen and fixes his stare on Wick, the room thick with unspoken tension and impending revelation.",

He takes a seat at the bar, placing his paper bag aside and counting out his money. **Nat**, the bartender, pours him a drink and then returns to his tasks. Don, suddenly aware of the patrons around him and Nat's watchful eyes, pauses with his glass mid-air, then affects an air of casual indifference as he puts it down.\n\nHe lights a cigarette, his gaze landing on his whiskey. In one swift motion, he downs the drink just as **Gloria**, a woman from a nearby table, heads to the powder room, playfully running her finger through his hair. Don turns back to Nat, subtly revealing bottles hidden in his paper bag. Nat, catching on, leans in as Don points to his empty glass. Without batting an eyelid, Nat pours him another.\n\nMeanwhile, **Gloria** returns, repeating her flirtatious gesture as she passes Don. This time, he catches her hand, drawing her briefly towards him before she returns to her table. The camera lingers on the wet rings left by Don's glass on the bar, showing a series of quick dissolves as the number of rings increases, implying the passage of time and drinks consumed.\n\nThe scene shifts to **Wick** packing a suitcase, snapping it shut as **Helen** follows him into the living room.

A bottle of whiskey peeks out from his pocket, and he wipes his dry mouth with a handkerchief before tucking it away. Fighting an internal battle, he clutches a coat check ticket from his pocket and abruptly leaves his seat, ignoring the disapproving murmurs from those around him.\n\nAt the counter, he places the check down, stirring the attendant from his newspaper. The attendant takes the check and departs briefly, leaving the man, Don, to nervously roll his program and jam it into the sand of a nearby cuspidor. Upon returning, the attendant presents a leopard coat and a small lady's umbrella, causing Don's anxiety to spike. Unable to argue, Don shoves the items back towards the attendant, who has since retreated and resumed his idle state.\n\nDon grabs his coat and thrusts the leopard coat towards Helen, quickly checking his coat to ensure the bottle is still there. Helen is left holding the leopard coat and his bowler hat as Don storms off, only to return for the hat and then impulsively toss the umbrella towards Helen, who fumbles to catch it. The umbrella clatters to the ground, leaving Don looking sheepish. He retrieves the umbrella, and they begin to talk and walk, eventually making their way to the street, with Don carrying his coat.\n\nA moment of indecision is swiftly resolved as Don feels the bottle in his raincoat. He begins to put it on as they step outside, but the calamity strikes. The whiskey bottle slips and shatters on the sidewalk, causing Helen to pause and look down before walking away. Don, looking at the broken bottle and then at Helen, calls out to her. Despite the dark and drizzling rain, he joins her, taking the umbrella and sheltering them both as they proceed down the street.\n\nThe scene transitions to a bar bathed in sunlight.

    "458": "In a swift and menacing motion, a man pulls out a lethal dagger, its triangular blade glinting wickedly, and dashes forward. Inigo swiftly closes the distance, rushing down the stairs into a grand dining hall. Count Rugen hurls the dagger with deadly precision. Inigo desperately tries to dodge, but the blade sinks deep into his stomach, sending him crashing against the wall, eyes glazed over, blood seeping from the wound. Across the room, Count Rugen watches coldly as Inigo slumps to the floor.\n\nMeanwhile, Buttercup calmly shuts the door of the Honeymoon Suite, walks quietly to a table, and opens a jeweled box to retrieve an equally deadly dagger. With a serene expression, she presses the knife to her bosom. Suddenly, she turns, startled. Westley is lying on the bed, Yellin's sword by his side. Though his voice is strong, he remains immobile. Buttercup rushes to his side, covering him with kisses before pulling back, causing Westley's head to thump against the headboard.\n\nIn the dining hall, Count Rugen is taken aback but quickly recovers. Inigo struggles, feebly pulling the dagger from his stomach and clutching the wound with his left hand. The Count advances, sword ready, intent on finishing Inigo off. Inigo weakly parries the Count's thrust, but Rugen's blade pierces his left shoulder. The Count steps back, preparing for another strike at Inigo's heart. Inigo uses the wall for support, slowly forcing himself to stand, managing to parry again despite Rugen's blade slicing through his right arm. Inigo seems unfazed by the pain.\n\nThe Count pauses, watching Inigo's relentless effort to rise. Just as Rugen is about to strike again, Inigo manages a surprising counterattack, causing the Count to jump back in shock. Inigo pushes away from the wall, gathering his strength. Enraged, Count Rugen launches a fierce assault, his masterful swordsmanship driving Inigo back against the wall. Yet, Inigo's defense holds; none of the Count's blows land. The Count steps back momentarily, reassessing his strategy against Inigo's unexpected resilience.",
    "461": "In the dim silence of a bedroom, a frail, pale boy, known as the Kid, clutches his sheets with a quiet desperation, his grandfather watching patiently beside him. Suddenly, the scene shifts, and we find ourselves in a boat on the open sea. Buttercup is seen treading water, her last moment of freedom before a monstrous Shrieking Eel bears down on her, jaws agape. Just as the creature is about to strike, a colossal arm intervenes, rendering the eel unconscious and hoisting Buttercup to safety with effortless ease. She is deposited on the deck of the boat, where Fezzik, the gentle giant, and Inigo stand ready. However, any sense of relief is short-lived as Vizzini begins to bind Buttercup's hands, and Inigo points out an ominous sight: a black sailboat, helmed by a mysterious Man In Black, is swiftly approaching.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the black sailboat seems to fly across the water, drawing ever closer. Once the Man In Black has shouted a name, the cliffs loom before them, colossal and sheer. The race to the cliffs begins, but despite the Man In Black's speed, the lead is insurmountable. Inigo steers them expertly towards the cliff face, where Fezzik deftly grabs a hidden rope, allowing them to start their ascent.\n\nWith Buttercup, Vizzini, and finally himself secured in a harness, Fezzik begins to climb, hauling his companions along with brute force. Below, the Man In Black leaps from his ship to the rope and commences a swift pursuit, his movements like lightning. Despite the head start, Fezzik's progress slows, and the Man In Black rapidly closes the gap. Panic surges through Buttercup as the Man In Black draws nearer, now less than a hundred feet behind. In a desperate move, Vizzini leaps off Fezzik's back and begins sawing at the rope with a knife, intending to eliminate their pursuer, while Inigo assists Buttercup and Fezzik awaits instruction, motionless.\n\nThe scene hangs in the balance, tension mounting as the Man In Black's approach becomes imminent, and the rope fibers steadily give way beneath Vizzini's frantic sawing. The fate of the group teeters on the edge—quite literally—as they face the precipice, the relentless pursuer, and the grim determination of their captor.\nThe movie continues with every character’s destiny intertwined in this perilous climb, with danger lurking from both above and below, promising a thrilling and unpredictable conclusion.",
    "462": "In the shadow of ancient stone ruins, once a fortress but now echoing the eerie allure of Stonehenge, a dramatic scene unfolds. The Man in Black scales the cliff face, his swift pace belying the treacherous journey. Vizzini, having cut the last of the rope, watches as it snakes away towards the channel. Fezzik stands with Inigo and Buttercup at the cliff's edge, all eyes on the Man in Black, who clings desperately to the jagged rocks, his life hanging in the balance.\n\nVizzini is stunned, turning to his companions as they observe the Man in Black's painstaking ascent. Inch by inch, he climbs, his progress slow but determined. The group at the top watches intently. Inigo nods, and Fezzik, after a moment's observation, hurries after Vizzini, leaving Inigo alone at the cliff's edge.\n\nInigo paces, his hands shaking loose as he practices his fencing skills. He is not a man accustomed to waiting. The Man in Black continues his climb, now mere inches closer to the top. Inigo watches, then walks away, only to return and engage in conversation with the climbing figure. This is the meeting of our two heroes, a tense exchange with death lingering mere inches away.\n\nThe Man in Black pauses, gathering his strength as he hangs precariously from the cliff face. Inigo, his eyes blazing with a new intensity, dashes to a nearby rock where the rope was originally tied. With a small coil of rope, he hurries back to the edge and hurls it down to the Man in Black.\n\nThe rope hangs tantalizingly close. The Man in Black releases his grip on the rocks and grabs the rope, hanging helplessly for a moment before looking up at Inigo. With a strain, Inigo pulls, his body forced away from the cliff edge as he hoists the Man in Black to safety. Slowly, steadily, the Man in Black rises through the early morning light, finally crawling to safety at the cliff's top, his eyes meeting Inigo's in a moment of silent understanding.",
    "469": "In the unfolding narrative, Joseph drapes a chain around his neck, receiving enthusiastic applause from the crowd. Salieri attempts to kiss Joseph's hand but is restrained and watched as Joseph proceeds. Cavalieri, with an adoring smile, offers a deep curtsey, which Joseph gently acknowledges by raising her up. The crowd then swarms around Salieri, showering him with praise and attempting to shake his hand, their excitement palpable as they tug and pat him. Amidst the commotion, Salieri's focus remains singular—he scans the room and finally spots Mozart standing there. Eagerly, Salieri moves toward him, a smile spreading across his face.\n\nThe scene shifts dramatically as explosive laughter fills the air. Mozart and Schikaneder, accompanied by three actresses, enter an apartment, clearly pleased with themselves. The front door opens cautiously, and Mozart, still rather drunk, pokes his head into the room, trying not to make a noise. His face breaks into a smile upon seeing the strangers, and he flings the door wide open to admit Schikaneder and the girls. Mozart's gaze fixes on the stage, where the imposing figure of the Commendatore, in robes and helmet, stands with arms extended, pointing accusingly.\n\nA colossal nailed fist smashes through the painted backdrop of a dining room set, and the giant armored statue of the Commendatore strides onstage, his finger leveled at Don Giovanni, who sits at the supper table, frozen in horror. Under the table, his servant Leporello trembles with fear. Salieri watches from the shadows, unseen in the semi-darkness of a box, as the theater is only half full.\n\nThe Commendatore confronts Giovanni on stage, and the audience's attention is riveted on Salieri, whose wide-eyed stare reveals his intense focus. Don Giovanni is seized by the Statue's icy grip, as flames erupt from artificial rocks and demons drag the libertine down to hell. Schikaneder sits at the table, drinking from a wine bottle, while Michael Schlumberg enters from his salon. Mozart stands nearby, looking unwell and bewildered, his eyes wide with panic. Suddenly, he springs up, visibly terrified, and runs into his workroom, shutting the door behind him.\n\nConstanze, a bit frightened herself, cautiously opens the front door to find Schikaneder, floridly dressed as usual. Lorl peeks out from the kitchen, her eyes fixed on the manuscript lying on the table. Schikaneder eagerly approaches the manuscript and picks up a page without waiting for a response. Mozart emerges from his workroom, appearing wild-eyed and extremely pale to Schikaneder, who stares at him in shock. Mozart giggles triumphantly, offering his head with a bright, demented smile. Schikaneder, moved by the strange sight, grabs Mozart's lapels, while a frightened and tearful Lorl sits before Salieri, her emotions laid bare.",
    "468": "In the faint, flickering light, an eighteenth-century balustrade and a stone staircase come into view, seen from the landing above. A branched candlestick held by Salieri's gaunt, middle-aged valet and a large dish of sugared treats carried by his plump, Italian cook illuminate their ascent. Both men are cloaked in shawls over their nightclothes and wooden clogs, their faces etched with worry. Their shadows dance on the decaying walls, as a cat darts between their legs upon reaching the salon door. Terror strikes them as they try the handle, and the door swings open to reveal a grim sight: Old Salieri lies in a pool of blood, his throat slit but still alive, a razor grasped in his hand. He feebly gestures, prompting his servants to rush to him, attempting to staunch his wound with a napkin, amidst the clutter of antique furniture and books.\n\nIn stark contrast, a lavish Masquerade Ball is underway, with twenty-five dancing couples and fifty guests enjoying the orchestral music. As the dance shifts to a quicker pace, Salieri is carried from his home on a stretcher, loaded onto a horse-drawn wagon under a doctor's watchful eye. The wagon races through Vienna's snowy streets, with Salieri wrapped in blankets, barely conscious. Doctor Gulden, accompanied by the self-important Father Vogler, navigates the hospital's wide corridor lined with mentally disturbed patients in white smocks. Later, Salieri, seated in a wheelchair, finds solace in playing unrecognizable melodies on a forte-piano, his enthusiasm growing with each note.",
    "471": "The film opens with **Katherina Cavalieri**, a 24-year-old soprano in an intricate Persian mythological costume, captivating the audience with a elaborate aria by Salieri. As she reaches the finale, the crowd erupts in applause. **Antonio Salieri**, cleverly plays the opening of Mozart's *Eine Kleine Nachtmusik*, drawing a smile and hum from a nearby priest.\n\nThe scene shifts to young **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart** at six, blindfolded and seated at a harpsichord. He's playing for the Pope and an esteemed assembly of cardinals and churchmen. His proud father, **Leopold**, stands nearby. As the piece concludes, Leopold places his son on the harpsichord's lid, revealing Mozart's pale, wide-eyed face. Among the spectators is a enraptured twelve-year-old Salieri, seated between his indifferent father and placid mother, with a stark crucifix looming over the altar.\n\nAt the Salieri home, the family is at dinner. A large cooked fish graces the table. **Father Salieri**, tucking a napkin into his chin, eats voraciously until he chokes on a bone. Despite the women's efforts to save him, he perishes.\n\nYears later, a grand room teems with guests and soft Gypsy melodies. Musicians from the Archbishop's orchestra prepare their 18th-century wind instruments. Thirty-one-year-old **Salieri**, dignified in black and white, weaves through the crowd, his attention hijacked by a servant bearing a tray of pastries. He follows the servant to a room filled with confectionery-laden tables—his personal paradise. As the servant departs, Salieri sneaks in, unable to resist the sweet allure.",
    "472": "In the opening moments, Antonio Salieri slips into the room, his eyes scanning the surroundings warily. A feast of sweets lies before him, and he gazes at it with eager anticipation, his mouth watering. Among the indulgences, a towering arrangement of dark chocolate balls shaped like a pineapple catches his eye. Reaching out to snatch one, he freezes as the sound of giggling approaches. Quickly, he ducks behind the pastry table to avoid detection.\n\nA young girl, Constanze, dashes into the room, racing across it to hide behind one of the tables. The room falls silent briefly before a finely dressed Mozart, aged 26 and bearing the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg, bursts in. He is bewildered, having lost sight of Constanze. Unbeknownst to him, a concealed Salieri watches in astonishment as Mozart dives under the tablecloth, playfully pouncing on Constanze.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Grand Salon, the audience is mostly seated, and musicians holding exotic wind instruments are in position, the room ablaze with candlelight. The Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Colloredo, a small, self-important figure in a scarlet skullcap, enters with his Chamberlain, Count Arco. The assembly stands as the Archbishop takes his throne. Rather than addressing the gathering, a musician approaches the Chamberlain, whispering a message.\n\nBack in the buffet room, Mozart and Constanze tussle on the floor, their playfulness turning tender. They share a kiss and embrace, but the moment is fleeting. Constanze suddenly pushes him away, striking him. A disheveled Mozart leaps up and rushes out, leaving Salieri gaping in amazement and disgust.\n\nMozart hastily makes his way to the Grand Salon, attempting to straighten his attire. The opening of his Serenade fills the air as the leader of the wind musicians tentatively conducts the ensemble. All eyes turn to Mozart as he enters, bowing to the Archbishop, and proceeding to the dais with as much dignity as he can muster. The conductor relinquishes his place, and Mozart deftly takes over, leading the musicians through the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361).\n\nConstanze slips into the back of the salon, her embarrassment evident, as Salieri looks on, still reeling from his accidental voyeurism. The audience's delight is palpable, and Mozart, equally pleased, bows to their admiration before exiting the room with a passionate flourish.\n\nOutside the Archbishop's private apartment, a group of concertgoers, including Constanze, await Mozart's appearance. Upon seeing him, they erupt into enthusiastic applause, their appreciation for his artistry undeniable.",
    "481": "Lila spots a narrow alley beyond an L-shaped cluster of cabins and begins walking towards it, her eyes fixed ahead. An old house looms against the sky, and she advances with determination. As she nears the house, her gaze shifts upward, taking in the structure and the porch that stretches out in front. Lila ascends the porch steps, pushes open the door, and reveals a hallway, pausing briefly to listen before continuing inside.\n\nMeanwhile, Norman stands behind a counter, his eyes fixed on Sam, who is casually seated on a small sofa. Back in the house, Lila climbs the stairs, her ascent tracked by the camera until she reaches the top, where she finds a closed door to her right. After a moment of hesitation, she opens the door and recoils at the sight before her, an icy chill running down her spine. Despite her initial impulse to leave, she enters the room, leaving the door ajar.\n\nThe room is adorned with an elaborate dressing table, a satin recamier, and a grand wardrobe, among other antique furnishings. Lila's attention is drawn first to the bed, then to the dressing table, and finally to the wardrobe. She tentatively opens one of its doors, revealing a row of neatly pressed dresses.\n\nExiting the mother's room, Lila proceeds to explore another room across the hall, this one with a half-open door. She feels along the wall for a switch and flicks on the light. Inside, she approaches a chair, and as she touches it, a figure within begins to rotate stiffly, revealing the lifeless body of a woman long deceased. Lila looks on in abject horror at the grim sight before her.\n\nUnbeknownst to Lila, Sam has risen from his seat and now stands by the counter, his gaze directed out the window towards the old house, oblivious to the terrifying discovery she has just made.",
    "486": "*Norman’s gaze fixates on a picture hanging on the distant wall where he leans. With a tentative touch, he carefully lifts the small frame from its hook. Suddenly, a pinpoint of light beams from the newly exposed hole in the wall, illuminating Norman's face in the otherwise dimly lit room. The camera closes in on Norman until his profile dominates the screen, capturing the precise moment when the tiny light spot strikes his eye. Peering through the small hole, Norman—and the audience—gain a hidden view into Mary’s cabin, where she is in the process of undressing, clad only in her bra and half-slip. She stoops slightly to unhook her bra, revealing more of her form to Norman's watchful eye. Shifting from voyeurism to discretion, Norman turns away as Mary slips into a robe, hiding her complete nudity.*\n\n*Norman turns from the peephole, pausing briefly before decisively rehanging the picture to cover the intrusive aperture. With swift steps, he exits the parlor, moves through the office, and emerges onto the porch, leaving the door ajar. Norman strides along the porch towards the main house, his pace as determined as his intent. Upon reaching the path, he halts, glancing up at the lit bedroom window. With renewed resolve, he straightens his shoulders and marches up to the house. Entering, he pauses at the base of the staircase, glancing up towards the bedroom door, before he sidesteps the stairs and makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall, wearily sinking into a chair.*\n\n*Meanwhile, Mary sits at a small desk, engrossed in her notebook calculations. She tears out a page, rises, and shreds it into small pieces. Disposing of the paper fragments, she drops them into the toilet and flushes. Shedding her robe, she steps into the tub and starts the shower. The scene lingers momentarily on Mary as she cleanses herself, the water and suds rinsing over her. Suddenly, the bathroom door creaks open ominously, casting a woman's shadow over the shower curtain. Unaware, Mary has her back to the curtain. Without warning, a hand grasps and violently tears the curtain aside, revealing a stark expression of pure terror etched on Mary’s face.*",
    "488": "**Movie Description:**\n\nUnder the watchful gaze of Norman, a figure retreats in a car, the engine humming away into the distance. Suddenly, another vehicle pulls up, and out steps Arbogast, leaving his car idling. He strides across the highway, the camera panning out to reveal his journey towards a phone booth. Entering, he consults a small notebook, deposits a dime, and dials a number with deliberate care. Upon finishing the call, he exits the booth.\n\nThe scene shifts to a distant view of a House and Motel, both illuminated by a faint glow from their windows. Norman emerges from his office, a stack of sheets neatly folded over his arm. He ventures towards the remote cabins, entering the last one and switching on the light, as a white Ford creeps into the foreground and halts. Arbogast alights and makes his way to the motel office.\n\nFinding the office vacant, Arbogast explores further, entering a parlor teeming with birds. He discovers an unlocked door, giving it a cautious glance before venturing upstairs. The house is shrouded in darkness, save for a soft spill of light from the upstairs hall. Ascending the stairs with guarded steps, Arbogast is unaware of the impending danger. A doorway creaks open, revealing Mother, her silhouette armed with a towering knife. In a brutal flash, the blade lashes out, slashing Arbogast's face and neck, sending him tumbling down the stairs in a desperate grasp for support. Mother's formidable figure looms into the foreground, the knife plunging repeatedly.\n\nMeanwhile, Lila waits anxiously by the phone, her figure unmoved for an hour. Sam paces restlessly, occasionally pausing at the window before resuming his worried march. The small room is thick with tension, the air heavy with smoke and weariness, as the two await word from Arbogast, unaware of the horror that has befallen him.",

He moves to the phone and dials the operator. abruptlSam begins to leave, heading towards the door. Lila trails after him as he enters the store. Midway through, he halts, turning to place his hands reassuringly on her arms. Meanwhile, Norman's silhouette is visible, frozen in place. He pivots gradually, his profile emerging in the dim light, chin lowered as he casts a furtive glance over his shoulder towards the house.\n\nThe store is cloaked in darkness, with only a faint glow from the back room piercing the gloom. From the street door's perspective, a tiny, distant figure of Lila is seen seated and waiting in the back room. Suddenly, she leaps up and dashes through the aisle of hardware, her figure growing larger until she comes into full view. From her vantage point, Sam is seen exiting his truck and approaching the store's door. He enters, and the two exchange a quiet, meaningful look. Lila senses his pause, turns, and for a moment, they lock eyes across the darkened room. She hands the receiver to the Sheriff, who accepts it reluctantly, listening to the faint ringing on the other end. Sam and Lila fix their gaze on the Sheriff, who in turn stares back at them. When he finally speaks, his voice carries an almost imperceptible tone of irony.\n\nNorman is seated in the dim light cast by a single lamp, the phone by his side, his hand still lingering near it as if frozen after hanging up. He is fixated on a shrike-like bird perched on the lamp shade. Abruptly, he rises, hurriedly exiting the room. Attempting to switch off the lamp, he instead knocks the bird off the shade. He turns off the lamp, traverses the darkened office, and steps outside. Norman descends from the porch, follows the path straight to the house, opens the door, and enters. He ascends the stairs, lingers for a moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and steps inside, leaving the door ajar.\n\nNorman retreats, and the others follow suit. A woman smiles brightly, as if hosting a discussion on the year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, and they depart. The Sheriff nods as he leaves, and Sam and Lila are left alone at the curb outside the deserted chapel. As the truck pulls away, Sam takes Lila's arm, guiding her towards the path leading to the old house.

    "493": "In the dimly-lit Italian restaurant, Malcolm hurriedly enters and finds Anna seated alone at a corner table, a slice of cake with a candle sitting untouched before her. She quietly stirs sugar into her coffee, glancing briefly at Malcolm as he takes the seat across from her. Their interaction is tense; Malcolm holds up his arm as if to shield his face, then stops abruptly, visibly struck by Anna's words.\n\nEarlier that day, Malcolm had been with Cole, a young boy in a school uniform. Malcolm had pointed to a chair across the coffee table, closing his eyes tightly. Cole, surprised, had edged forward tentatively. Malcolm opened his eyes and fixed his gaze on Cole, who inched closer to the chair. Malcolm lowered his fingers from his temple and smiled, noticing the large silver watch that hung loosely on Cole's thin wrist. Suddenly, Cole stepped back, causing Malcolm to lower his hands in surprise and resume his initial pose, fingers pressed to his temple. Malcolm's gaze shifted from Cole's uniform to his feet, as the boy slowly retreated into the doorway of another room, his tiny figure disappearing from view.\n\nLater, Cole played behind the couch, his actions hidden from view. Occasionally, glimpses of his toys peeked over the couch's back, but it was unclear what he was doing. Suddenly, Cole stilled, looking directly at Malcolm. The man watched Cole carefully, his desk covered in open texts, a thick reference book circled with a phrase drawing his attention briefly. Malcolm rose, grabbing his coat, and turned back to Cole, who looked up at him with sad eyes, brow furrowed in thought.\n\nIn a classroom, Mr. Cunningham surveyed his students, a mix of eight and nine-year-olds. Cole rested his chin on his desk, watching the class with wide eyes. The teacher scanned the blank faces, surprise crossing his features as he saw a hand raised—a hand he hadn't expected.",

Suddenly, the front door creaks open, revealing Lynn carrying Cole, who is fast asleep on her shoulder. She traverses the hall, placing Cole gently onto his bed, where his German Shepherd puppy is already nestled. Cole clutches a tiny party hat in his hands, a remnant of some earlier festivity. Lynn pauses, watching the pair sleep peacefully.\n\nAs she turns to leave, she notices Cole's sweater draped over her shoulder. Pulling it off, she begins to fold it, her attention drawn to a rip in the fabric. Her eyes dart to Cole, noticing three small tears in the back of his T-shirt. Gingerly, she inspects the tears, finding deep, fingernail-like scratches on his skin. Panic begins to rise in her eyes as she looks around helplessly, the house eerily still and unnaturally silent. The thermostat reads a chilling fifty-two degrees.\n\nLater, Cole's door creaks open, his tiny face peeking out into the dark hallway. His eyes scan the darkness as he tentatively steps out, his knees pressed together, body squirming with the urgent need to use the bathroom. He hastily makes his way to the bathroom halfway down the corridor, turning on the light and checking behind the shower curtain before relieving himself. Suddenly, he freezes, his body becoming very still. He slowly reaches for the toilet handle, flushing it before turning to face the dark hallway, his breath forming tiny clouds in the cold air.\n\nA slant of light from the kitchen catches his eye. He moves down the hall, turning the corner to find a figure standing at the stove, cooking. Cole's fear initially subsides, but his face soon pales as the figure turns, revealing a woman with a menacing smile and savagely cut wrists. Cole backs away in horror, turning to run down the hall and into his room. He dives into his makeshift tent, the red interior lit up, religious pictures taped to the bedsheet walls.

It takes him a moment before he can form the words he wants to say.\n\nLater, Cole and Malcolm, both dressed in suits, are passengers on a downtown Septa public bus. Cole rests his head against the scratched window, his large eyes absorbing the passing cityscape as Malcolm falls silent. The bus navigates the old Philadelphia streets, headed downtown, passing rows of parked cars that spill onto the streets from driveways.\n\nThey arrive at a house where visitors in suits and dark dresses move solemnly in and out. Cole and Malcolm join the flow of people slowly walking towards the door. Outside, a frail four-year-old girl sits on the swings, dressed in a dark dress. Inside, the home is filled with mourners, standing room only, the air thick with hushed whispers. Cole turns to stare quietly at the door, waiting a long time before he reaches for the doorknob.\n\nOnce inside the girl's bedroom, Cole's gaze takes in the hospital bed by the window, the walls covered in get-well cards and drawings, and the shelves filled with puppets. Beside the shelf, there's a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod. Cole walks to the shelf, picks up a finger puppet dancer, and places it in his pocket. On the girl's desk, there's a large collection of video cassettes, which Cole examines carefully before turning his attention to the closets.\n\nHe notices the girl's hand slip under the bed and freezes, waiting. Slowly, he bends down, hands touching the floor as he tilts his head to look under the bed. There, the emaciated little girl who had visited his tent is curled on the floor, her bulging eyes glaring at him. Suddenly, she thrusts a jewelry box forward, which slides across the wooden floor, stopping just before Cole. The two stare at each other, the room thick with mourners gathered around the girl's mother, a young woman in her late twenties.\n\nFrom the doorway, Malcolm watches breathlessly as Cole moves through the crowd of adults. The girl's father, Mr. Collins, a thin man in his late twenties, is seated on a reading chair next to a TV, seemingly oblivious to the tense scene unfolding in the bedroom.",

The movie then abruptly flashes back to Mickey's date with Holly, starting with a lively performance at a rock club. The camera pans to reveal three punk rock fans—a girl with vibrant pink hair, another with a spiked mohawk, and a guy sporting Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses—all bobbing their heads to the music of The 39 Steps, who are tearing up the stage with their sleazy rock vibe. The camera sweeps across the entranced audience, packed tightly around small, smoky tables, and lands on Mickey and Holly crammed together at one of them. Mickey looks unsettled, while Holly is entranced by the music, tapping her foot and taking a drag from her cigarette.\n\nHolly glances at Mickey with growing impatience before turning her attention back to the band. The camera zooms in on the lead singer, dripping with sweat, clad in a cut-off red shirt, and belting into the microphone while strumming his guitar. Back at the table, Holly's annoyance with Mickey becomes more apparent as she snorts a line of cocaine using a small metal straw, ignoring Mickey’s pleas. She quickly stows the vial in her purse, sniffs, and resumes smoking her cigarette.\n\nThe scene shifts to Mickey and Holly walking briskly down a dimly lit sidewalk, arguing. They pass lighted clothing store windows, and a few cars glide by in the dark street. The film then cuts to a different setting where Mickey and Holly are seated at a candlelit table, Holly’s restlessness evident as she constantly fidgets, sniffs, and gulps her wine. Mickey tries to focus on an offscreen piano performance by Bobby Short, briefly glimpsed playing elegantly. As they finally leave the venue, a taxi pulls away from the curb, and they exit through the hotel's revolving doors, the tension between them palpable.",

Lee smiles warmly, exchanging greetings with those around her.\n\nEntering the living room, Lee pauses to share a moment with a child she has just embraced, then continues on. The camera keeps her in focus as she stops to chat with her mother, their conversation flowing easily. Even as she moves on, Lee keeps talking to her mother, effortlessly multitasking amidst the bustling environment.\n\nShe weaves past several guests, taking a moment to greet April with a warm, fleeting hug. Meanwhile, Elliot's voice-over persists as he comes into view, engaged in conversation with a portly, gesticulating man, both clutching drinks. Lee, bearing a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, squeezes between them, the men raising their glasses to make room. Elliot's gaze lingers on Lee as she walks away, his attention momentarily diverted from his chatty companion.\n\nThe camera resumes its pursuit of Lee, who, having set down her tray and drinks near April, briskly moves past a doorway where Elliot, lost in thought, watches her, captivated. The camera remains with Elliot, who can't tear his gaze away from Lee, even as the background hums with warm conversations among the guests.\n\nHannah, bearing her own tray of hors d'oeuvres, approaches the distracted Elliot from behind. Helping himself to a snack, Elliot joins Hannah as they stroll past the bookshelf into the living room, chatting and nibbling. They disappear offscreen just as Holly emerges from a hallway, carrying a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres. She stands at the hallway entrance, observing the offscreen guests while enjoying her refreshments.\n\nHolly hesitates, swallowing loudly before taking another sip of her drink. Hannah and Elliot approach her, and soon, Holly and Hannah are sharing laughter. Hannah, licking her fingers, makes her way to the stove, weaving past a refrigerator cluttered with memos. The kitchen is a hub of activity, filled with a large table covered with food, hanging cookware, and general party disorder. As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah is a whirlwind of motion, preparing food while engaging in their sisterly conversation.

A man helps himself to one, silently expressing his thanks, as the camera glides past an open bookshelf and two suited boys enjoying soda and snacks, ultimately revealing Lee. She leans against a doorway, lost in thought, absorbed in the music. Mavis passes by in the hallway beyond.\n\nNearby, clusters of people are engrossed in conversation. Elliot, holding a drink, approaches Lee from behind. She slips away from him, leaving Elliot to glance briefly at her before turning his attention to the crowd in the living room, taking a sip from his glass.\n\nIn the pantry, Holly is busy preparing food. Hannah enters, heads straight for the refrigerator, and retrieves two tomatoes, ignoring Holly entirely. She moves to the table, collecting more food, while Holly washes and dries her hands at the sink. Hannah, arms full of vegetables, walks over to Holly, who turns away just as Hannah storms out through a nearby door. Moments later, Hannah reenters, carrying even more vegetables, and deposits them on the counter. Holly, after placing a dishtowel down, absently organizes items on the food-laden table. Hannah, visibly annoyed, gathers spices from the table. Holly reappears with a silver ice bucket, pausing at the table's edge to face Hannah. Hannah then carries a large bowl and her armload of spices into the pantry, setting the spices down on the counter. Holly turns away once more.\n\nIn the living room, guests mingle, chat, and help themselves to a buffet. Offscreen, Lee and Elliot's intense conversation can be heard as the camera slowly reveals them near a doorway. Lee moves to close an open door quickly.

She surveys the kitchen before entering, only to find Holly working nearby. Holly lets out a chuckle, prompting Norma to retreat, the door swinging closed behind her. Holly watches the door, wine glass in hand, as the story transitions to Hannah's living room.\n\nA jovial, portly uncle occupies the sofa, surrounded by children eagerly leaning on a coffee table laden with glasses and chips. Guests mill about in the background, a smiling couple among them, while Mavis greets more arrivals at the door. The uncle playfully refills the kids' glasses with beer, eliciting excited cheers. He toasts with a little girl on his lap, their bottles clinking together. The scene concludes with everyone enjoying their drinks as the focus shifts to Hannah's bedroom.\n\nHannah's face fills the screen briefly before she approaches Elliot in the bathroom, where he's standing at the sink. He retrieves something from the medicine cabinet, obscured by the door, then returns to the sink to dry his hands as Hannah continues to speak. He closes the door momentarily, then puts away an aspirin bottle and forcefully shuts the cabinet. Elliot exits, leaving Hannah visibly stunned.\n\nSoft piano music accompanies Hannah as she walks down the hallway, deep in thought, and wearily sits on the couch's arm. The camera pans to photographs on the mantel, zooming in on one of Hannah and her sisters, Lee and Holly.\n\nIn the bedroom, Elliot's arm reaches out to switch off the night table lamp, plunging the room into darkness.

The movie then shifts to Mickey, walking along a bustling sidewalk, his hands tucked into his pockets, blending in with the other pedestrians. He pulls his coat closer to his body as he strides along, glancing into a building and spotting Holly, her jacket casually draped over her shoulders, browsing through records. Mickey enters Tower Records, ascending a few stairs to reach the main selling floor, and stops right in front of Holly. She chuckles and continues perusing the records, moving down the aisle with Mickey beside her. They converse, partially hidden by a large white Jazz sign with a red circle, as Mickey picks up a record and inspects it. Holly watches him hopefully, laughing embarrassedly as he returns the record to its bin.\n\nThe scene briefly pauses and transitions to Mickey's apartment, where a chaise and an ashtray sit nearby. The camera pans down the chaise, past stacks of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He sits on the edge, picking at his fingers, listening to Holly read her script aloud while sitting cross-legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow. Closing the script, Holly looks up at Mickey, who smiles and shrugs, at a loss for words. Overwhelmed with excitement, Holly stands up, her hand on her head, and begins pacing the room with her script in hand, the camera following her movements.\n\nThe film then moves outdoors, where trees line the sidewalk, and Holly and Mickey emerge from a door, walking up the street past similar apartment buildings and a few passersby. They soon arrive at a charming café with glass and stained wood, where they are seen through the window having lunch. Holly talks animatedly while Mickey takes a sip of coffee, with people passing by outside.\n\nThe story progresses to an almost isolated path in Central Park, adorned with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deeply engaged in conversation. Suddenly, the film cuts to Mickey's flashback, revealing a nervous and perspiring Mickey alone in his apartment, his voice narrating the scene.

As Lee speaks, Elliot pulls back a hanging curtain, unveiling a stereo and a collection of records. He turns to look at Lee, off-screen, and retrieves a bottle of antihistamines from the stereo shelf. Meanwhile, Lee sits down on the bed, still clutching a book. Elliot approaches her, taking a seat on a footstool in front of her. They share a light-hearted moment, chuckling together.\n\nHannah enters the bedroom, munching on a carrot stick. She walks towards Elliot and Lee, momentarily becoming the focus. Holly laughs, causing Lee to glance over and react. Embarrassed, Hannah sits with her hands covering her face. Their attention turns to Evan, listening intently. Despite her embarrassment, Hannah playfully makes a victory sign, causing Lee and Holly to struggle to suppress their laughter. Norma glares at them, disapprovingly. Elliot comforts Hannah, wrapping his arm around her and pulling her close for a tender kiss on the cheek. She reciprocates with a hug.\n\nAs Mavis the maid exits with some trays, the group erupts in cheers and applause. Holly waves her napkin at April, then raises her wine glass. The celebration continues with a toast to Hannah, who smiles but is clearly embarrassed. The guests quiet down, sipping their wine as Norma speaks. Lee and Holly try, unsuccessfully, to contain their laughter. Mavis reenters to serve more food to the children. Norma leads a toast to her daughter, and the applause and cheers begin anew. Hannah chuckles, taking Elliot's hand as she looks around the table. He gently kneads her shoulder, sharing her tender amusement. Still embarrassed, Hannah looks down at her plate.

Ron sighs, his breath heavy with resignation. Mickey, seen in the mirror, begins to pace anxiously.\n\nThe scene shifts to Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former partner, cruising down a tranquil, palm-lined street. Wearing sunglasses and headphones, he taps his fingers to the beat of music only he can hear on his Walkman, a content smile playing on his lips. Mickey's voiceover fills the sunlit scene. As Mickey's musings come to an end, Hannah appears, walking towards her front door. She opens it, her back to the camera, revealing Mickey standing on the other side, holding two boxed gifts.\n\nHannah nods patiently, her hand patting Mickey's back as they cross the foyer into the den, where their twin children are playing. Mickey, still in his coat, hands a gift to each child. The twins, excited, put down their gifts—one on the sofa, the other on the coffee table—and embrace their father. Mickey tosses a football, which results in the sharp sound of breaking glass. Hannah and Mickey react, their expressions a mix of surprise and concern.\n\nLater, Mickey is seen walking up a West Side street, his hands tucked into his coat pockets. He pushes open the door to Dr. Abel's office, and the scene transitions to the doctor's consultation room. Dr. Abel is seen through the doorway, rifling through a file cabinet. As Mickey speaks from offscreen, the doctor turns and approaches him, the camera tracking his movements from the other side of the wall.\n\nThe camera sweeps across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, engaged in conversation with the offscreen Dr. Abel. The doctor reappears onscreen, standing directly in front of Mickey, sniffing thoughtfully. He stares down at Mickey as he speaks, then chuckles softly.\n\nAn upbeat big-band tune plays as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination. Dr. Abel leans in, using an otoscope to inspect the ear of a nervous Mickey. The doctor's hands are shown adjusting the dials on a sonometer. Mickey, perched on a high stool with large earphones on his head, listens intently, his eyes squinting in concentration. He raises a finger in response to the sounds in his headset. Finally, Dr. Abel strikes a large tuning fork, placing the vibrating instrument to Mickey's ear. Mickey looks up, nodding at the offscreen doctor.

The doctor appears preoccupied as he approaches his desk, revealing a frightened **Mickey** seated opposite. Dr. Abel leans over his desk, scribbling notes in Mickey's file, then chuckles as he closes it and places his pen on top. He moves around his desk to sit near Mickey, who is clearly anxious.\n\nNext, we see Mickey in a telephone booth near Dr. Abel's office, talking on the phone as rain pours down.

Both are dressed alike in uniforms consisting of black skirts, white shirts, and black bowties. April, dish in hand, hurriedly exits the kitchen to serve the awaiting guests. Holly calls after her, her voice trailing off as David enters the kitchen, passing April on his way in. He approaches Holly, who is engrossed in managing the stove, cluttered with pots and pans.\n\nAs Holly carries a freshly made quiche out to the party, April re-enters the kitchen through another door. She walks past David, heading to a counter where she begins neatly folding napkins. David leans casually against the sink, and the two shake hands in a friendly greeting. April then moves offscreen, leaving David and Holly in the kitchen. Holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table, while David circles it, placing a plate of clams amidst the disorder. Holly follows him, laughing as she tosses the napkin into a nearby garbage can. David pauses at a small television near the doorway, the screen flickering with canned laughter and indistinct chatter, mirroring the guests visible in the adjacent room.\n\nDavid checks his watch as Holly joins him, both of them drawn to the television's noise. Offscreen, April and Holly reassure David, who listens intently, clearly impressed.

David takes a moment to glance back at Holly before turning his attention to April.\n\nThe camera pans over the intricate facade of a rococo building, then moves to reveal an equally elegant structure beside it. The view then shifts starkly to an unattractive, ultra-modern building adorned with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs. The lens follows the building's unsightly entrance, where a large car is parked conspicuously. Across the street, David leads Holly and April down the canopied stairs of an apartment house, with Holly trailing slightly behind April. David leans expectantly over the car's roof, awaiting the women's decision.",

Just in the nick of time, Indy seizes Kazim and leaps into a motorboat piloted by Elsa, which pulls up alongside them. Kazim reveals a birthmark or perhaps a tattoo—a cruciform sword resembling a broadsword blade—before stepping ashore and walking away as the boat nears the canal's edge.\n\nThe scene shifts to a close-up of a water-soaked paper impression, a rubbing from the Grail Knight's shield. Brody examines it meticulously while nursing a bump on his head with an ice pack. Indy, clad in a bathrobe, leans in to scrutinize the impression. Brody sets the ice pack aside, picks up the Grail Diary, and traces his finger across the two-page spread. Indy then closes the diary, tucking it into his robe pocket before stepping out to discover his bedroom ransacked—mattress on the floor, drawers emptied.\n\nConcerned, Indy knocks on Elsa's door and enters to find her room in a similar state. He calls out, stepping into her bathroom where Elsa, draped in a silk robe, is startled. She turns off a record player and joins Indy, gazing in shock at her disheveled room. Indy reveals the Grail Diary, pulling Elsa closer. She stomps her foot angrily but melts into his embrace as they kiss passionately, eventually falling onto the bed. Outside, a gondolier sings as he navigates his boat past Indy's window, briefly distracting them before they succumb to their passion once more.\n\nLater, a Mercedes-Benz navigates sharp mountain curves, its journey from Venice to Salzburg mapped out against a backdrop of gathering storm clouds.",

The Second Man, however, catches wind of Sallah's presence, prompting both him and his companion to turn abruptly. Sallah, feigning nonchalance, sets down Brody's luggage and begins to search his clothing, finally producing a newspaper with a laugh. Brody watches, bewildered, as Sallah thrusts the newspaper into the Second Man's face, using it as a screen to deliver a solid punch.\n\nMeanwhile, Donovan escorts Vogel out, followed closely by Nazi guards. With the room cleared, Elsa turns her attention to Indy, gently caressing his face. Despite being bound back-to-back, Indy and Henry remain alert. Elsa leans in, sharing a whispered message meant for both of them, and seals it with a passionate kiss to Indy. Henry watches, barely concealing his disappointment. Vogel reappears, sternly reminding Elsa of her commitments, and she exits, leaving Vogel alone with the captives. He delivers a brutal punch to Indy before walking away.\n\nFrantic, Indy and Henry tug at their ropes. Henry manages to reach into Indy's pocket, grasping for the lighter. With a struggle, they ignite it, but Henry yelps in pain as the flame licks his hand. The lighter falls, igniting the rug when Henry fails to retrieve it. As the fire spreads, Indy wrestles with his bonds. His thrashing causes his foot to strike a metal grill, revealing a secret room where Nazi radiomen, oblivious to their presence, operate elaborate controls, and a woman plots coordinates on a map.\n\nIndy's foot strikes the grill again, this time alerting the woman. She screams just as Indy breaks free. The radiomen, now armed, trigger the secret door's rotation, but find Indy and Henry gone when they emerge through the fireplace.

Indy swiftly collects his whip, leather sack, and Henry's case, handing the latter to Henry before they dash off.\n\nFinding themselves in an empty chamber, Henry is visibly shaken by their ordeal as Indy desperately searches for an escape route. In his haste, Indy's frantic touch causes the floor to suddenly drop away, revealing a spiral staircase. He loses his grip and tumbles down the steps, with Henry following closely behind. The stairway opens into a vast, watery cavern beneath the castle, housing an extensive Nazi boat dock filled with motorboats, gunboats, and supply vessels. Indy commandeers one of the motorboats, but when Henry tosses him the case, Indy angrily returns it, much to Henry's confusion. Indy pushes the boat away from the dock just as Vogel and the Nazi soldiers enter, spot the staircase, and rush down to the dock. Realizing a motorboat is missing, Vogel orders his men into another boat in hot pursuit.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to a motorbike skidding to a halt, and Henry striking someone across the face. A sign points in opposite directions towards Venice and Berlin, with the camera zooming in on 'Berlin.'

As Indy prepares to strike Vogel, his backswing inadvertently hits Brody. Completing the motion, Indy knocks Vogel down, sending his hat flying.\n\nUndeterred, Vogel springs back up, swinging the shovel once more. Indy ducks, but the shovel catches Henry, sending him tumbling onto the moving tread, perilously close to being crushed. With swift reflexes, Indy grabs his whip, sending Vogel reeling. As Henry is carried towards the tank's front, Indy expertly wraps his bullwhip around Henry's ankle. Meanwhile, Sallah gallops up alongside the tank, tipping his fez to Henry.\n\nIn a tense struggle, Vogel lands a punch on Indy's back and grasps him around the neck, but Indy stubbornly maintains his grip on the whip. Sallah extends his arm, successfully pulling Henry to safety just as they reach the cliff's edge. Breaking free from Vogel's grasp, Indy delivers a final blow, sending Vogel's hat flying over the cliff as the tank plummets to the bottom in a fiery wreck.\n\nDazed, Indy joins Henry, Brody, and Sallah at the cliff's edge, staring down at the devastation. Henry, overcome with emotion, embraces Indy, who hugs him back, finally reconciling.

Elsa gasps and screams in horror as his skeletal hands reach out, choking her. Indiana Jones rushes forward, pushing the man, now revealed to be Donovan, away from Elsa. As Donovan falls, his body bursts into flames and shatters against the wall.\n\nIndy turns his attention to an array of chalices, carefully studying them. He picks up a simple earthenware jug and exchanges a meaningful look with Elsa. Approaching a well, he fills the jug with water and takes several large swallows. Together, Indy and Elsa step forward, holding the Grail. The two Nazi soldiers present are overcome with awe at the sight of the legendary artifact.\n\nIndy kneels beside Henry, tilting his head forward and holding the Grail to his lips. Henry, too weak to open his eyes, manages to swallow some water, though much of it trickles down the corners of his mouth. Indy then pours the water over Henry's wound, and to everyone's astonishment, the wound and bloodstain vanish. Color returns to Henry's face, and his eyes flutter open, lighting up at the sight of the Grail and then even more as he recognizes Indy.\n\nSuddenly, Nazi soldiers rush forward, dropping their weapons and raising their arms in surrender. Elsa steps forward, her face alight with the possession of the Grail, and stands on the edge of the Great Seal. A rumbling sound echoes through the cavern, the ground shifting and dirt falling from the ceiling. Elsa loses her footing and falls, the Grail slipping from her grasp. As she reaches for it, the ground splits open, and she slips into the crevasse.\n\nIndy lunges forward, managing to grab one of her hands as he slides across the slanted floor. Elsa, with her free hand, desperately tries to reach the Grail. Indy struggles to hold onto her, but her hand begins to slip from his grasp. The ledge Indy lies on starts to crumble. Henry quickly grabs one of Indy's hands, and as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with his other hand, he ultimately abandons it to grab onto Henry with both hands.

As Indy reads the inscriptions, Donovan pours champagne. Indy suddenly pauses, a startled look on his face, then accepts a glass from Donovan, his expression turning dubious. He stiffens briefly at the mention of his father but nods nonetheless.\n\nMrs. Donovan, a matronly figure in an expensive evening gown, enters the room. Donovan kisses her cheek, but she sighs and returns to the party, leaving Indy captivated by the archaeological potential of the Grail Tablet. He rubs champagne over it, only to have Donovan step beside him, prompting Indy to shake his head at Donovan's seemingly poor judgment. Donovan then presents an ancient leather-bound manuscript, which Indy views with considerable interest.\n\nLater, a Ford coupe races down a tree-lined street, pulling up in front of a house. Indy hurriedly exits, followed closely by Brody. They notice the front door slightly open, exchanging a concerned glance as they enter. Indy pushes open the door, calling out as he steps inside. Pulling back the curtains reveals a ransacked room. Brody picks up scattered mail from a cluttered desk, while Indy finds an envelope with a Venice postmark amidst his own mail.\n\nUncovering a small journal filled with handwritten notes and drawings, Indy captures Brody's curious gaze. He turns to a painting of Christ on the cross, blood dripping into a golden chalice, then to another depicting Eleventh Century Crusaders falling from a cliff, one saved by holding the Grail.",

With precise timing, he lifts the stand and strikes the tile just as the Librarian stamps a book, the sound echoing through the library and drawing the Librarian's curious glance. Indy persists, pounding the tile until it finally shatters, revealing a two-foot square hole.\n\nImpressed by Elsa's spirit, Indy cooperates with her, holding her hands and lowering her into the hole before slipping the Grail Diary to Brody and disappearing into the hole himself. He descends a steep step, then reaches back to help Elsa down. Together, they survey the dark, dank surroundings. Elsa produces a unique ivory four-leaf clover designed cigarette lighter, and they inspect the markings etched onto the walls. Indy takes the lighter and leads them down a murky passageway.\n\nMeanwhile, three armed men descend a spiral staircase towards an unsuspecting Brody. One of them, Kazim, strikes Brody sharply with his gun.\n\nBack in the passageway, Indy quickly examines the wall and runs his hand over the stone. Elsa holds the lighter as Indy rams his shoulder into the wall, collapsing it and tumbling into a room filled with bubbling, green slime and surrounded by skeletons in carved niches. Elsa peers through the hole in the wall, holding the lighter. Indy crafts a makeshift torch from a piece of cloth torn from a skeleton and a bone, dipping it in the oily water.\n\nGuided by the torch, Indy and Elsa discover a narrow passageway flooded with knee-deep water teeming with thousands of rats crawling over each other. Elsa gasps in horror as the rats scamper between her legs, but Indy presses forward, with Elsa following despite her revulsion. Suddenly, Indy slips into a hole but quickly regains his balance and reaches out to Elsa.",

Harry watches, wide-eyed, as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, causing it to crumble and reveal a hidden tunnel. They step back, watching as the entrance becomes accessible. Using their wands as torches, they venture deeper into the tunnel.\n\nThe pair approach a serene lake, its dark surface reflecting the glow of their wands. Dumbledore sends a ball of light skimming across the water, illuminating a tiny island in the distance. He steps onto a half-submerged crystalline rock and stretches out his left hand over the water. The lake churns and bubbles, and a length of chain leaps into Dumbledore's grasp. He hands the chain to Harry, who pulls with all his might, revealing the carved prow of a small boat emerging from the depths.\n\nHarry tugs vigorously, drawing the boat towards them. They board and are slowly ferried across the still water to the island. Upon reaching it, they clamber onto the translucent rock, discovering a crystal basin filled with shimmering liquid nestled in a rock pedestal. Dumbledore passes his hand over the surface, then looks up sharply. Using a large shell as a cup, he drinks the liquid, shuddering as he finishes.\n\nDumbledore steps back and sits down, covering his ear with his blackened right hand. Harry picks up the shell, scoops more liquid, and helps Dumbledore drink. Repeatedly, Harry returns to the basin, filling the shell and forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is nearly empty. Dumbledore's eyes are half-closed, but he reluctantly opens his mouth each time.\n\nFinally, Dumbledore raises his head, eyes wide. Harry steps back, still holding the empty shell.

Gritting his teeth, he leans forward, using his wand hand as support, and submerges the shell until it brims with water. Suddenly, a skeletal hand lunges from the depths, seizing his arm. Harry wrestles free, only to witness the lake churning as emaciated corpses emerge, encircling the island. He slashes at them with his wand, while Dumbledore feebly attempts to reach his own.\n\nSwarms of cadavers assault Harry, dragging him beneath the water. One corpse entwines him from behind, pulling him deeper. Above, Harry sees flames dancing on the surface, balls of fire piercing the water. The creature releases him, and Harry resurfaces within a ring of fire. Dumbledore stands, wand whirling, fueling the protective blaze. The corpses recoil from the flames, allowing Harry to return to the island and help Dumbledore back to their boat. A path clears through the fire, revealing a safe route across the water.\n\nMeanwhile, at Hogwarts, Draco Malfoy lies awake in bed, then rises as the lights in Borgin and Burke shop extinguish.

Looking up, he sees bloodstained rafters exposed through broken plaster. Another drop lands on his forehead, which Dumbledore wipes off and tastes, his expression growing suspicious.\n\nDumbledore's gaze fixates on an over-stuffed armchair, and he advances towards it, with Harry following closely. Upon investigation with his wand, a man in disguise is revealed. The man spots Harry just as Dumbledore sweeps his wand across the room, magically repairing the chaos. Broken glass flies back into a shattered chandelier, re-hanging itself from the ceiling. A vinyl disk returns to a record player, books fly back onto shelves, and a grand piano rights itself. The missing plaster renews itself on the ceiling, making Harry smile. A piece from the chandelier, trapped under his trainer, zooms up to its rightful place as he lifts his foot.\n\nAmidst the repairs, Horace Slughorn, wearing pajamas made from upholstery fabric, grins at Harry. Harry crosses over to a collection of framed, moving photographs, where a group raise their glasses. Dumbledore leaves, and after a glance at Slughorn, Harry follows.

Following the notes in his book, Harry successfully drips juice into his cauldron. Hermione, frowning, consults her textbook again, while Crabbe and Goyle remain unsuccessful. Seamus's cauldron flares up, blackening his face, and green slime oozes from another girl's cauldron, plopping onto the table.\n\nHarry, undeterred, pours a clear liquid into his potion. Professor Slughorn, impressed, drops a leaf into Harry's brew and leads the class in applause. Draco and his Slytherin friends, however, refrain from joining in.\n\nMeanwhile, in his study, Professor Dumbledore examines an old book with a peculiar hole burnt into it. He places a ring within the hole and secures the book in a drawer. Turning to a cabinet filled with vials, he selects one and hands it to Harry, who approaches a Pensieve—a shallow metal basin hovering nearby. With Dumbledore's nod of approval, Harry pours the vial's contents into the basin. Dumbledore dims the lights with a flick of his hand, and as Harry plunges his face into the Pensieve, wispy trails of black smoke flow towards its base.\n\nHarry finds himself on a street, a large building looming ahead. A figure carrying an umbrella marches towards it. Inside, a younger Dumbledore steps into a room where an 11-year-old boy, Tom Riddle, sits at a table, frowning at the intruder. Dumbledore touches a wardrobe, which bursts into flames. Tom retrieves a metal box from the burning wardrobe, revealing small toys inside. Dumbledore, seeing the sullen boy, walks away but then stops abruptly. Swirling black smoke consumes the image, and Harry resurfaces from the Pensieve, staring resolutely ahead after taking a few deep breaths.\n\nAs Harry prepares for what lies ahead, Death Eaters hurtle through the clouds towards Hogwarts, only to hit an invisible shield and retreat. In a shadowy corridor, two birds in a cage hang silently as Draco Malfoy walks past them, approaching a wall adorned with a tapestry of a unicorn.",
    "603": "**Movie Description**\n\nDraco Malfoy pauses in a cluttered room, surveying his surroundings while idly tossing an apple. His attention is drawn to a creaking noise behind him. He turns and hauls down a heavy cloth, unveiling a tall, triangular cabinet reminiscent of one from Borgin and Burkes shop. He examines the cabinet intently.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Quidditch stadium, a lone student soars through the air. Below, Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley face the Gryffindor Quidditch hopefuls, who all turn towards them. Ron Weasley, looking stiff in his protective leather helmet, receives a wave from Hermione Granger in the stands. Cormac McLaggen struts up to Ron, catches a fly, slaps Ron's arm, and marches off, leaving Ron looking miserable. Cormac flies confidently towards the goalpost, while Ron struggles to stay on his broomstick. Lavender Brown watches Ron closely, and Cormac smirks as he catches Hermione's eye.\n\nThe trials commence with a chaotic flurry of activity. Players collide and fall, Ginny aims the Quaffle at Cormac's goal, and he swiftly punches it away, showcasing his prowess. Ron, on the other hand, flails wildly, barely deflecting shots before a Quaffle unseats him, leaving him dangling from his broomstick. Lavender cheers him on, and with Hermione watching, he clings back onto his broomstick anxiously. Cormac continues to smirk confidently until Hermione whispers a spell, causing him to jerk sideways and miss the Quaffle flying past him. A stray Quaffle hits Ron’s head, bouncing away as he swings helplessly.\n\nBack in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione pulls a face, while Ron glances at Lavender, who waves and then glares at him. Harry, appearing awkward, closes a book and gets up, only for Ginny to grab it from him. Hermione and Ginny stare at Harry, who shifts awkwardly before Ginny tosses the book back to him. He walks away, watched by both girls.\n\nLater, Harry sits in his room, studying a book filled with scribbled notes. Out in the snow, the trio—Harry, Ron, and Hermione—walk together, passing Professor Flitwick. They arrive at The Three Broomsticks, where Harry spots Draco leaving. Inside, Ron notices Ginny with Dean Thomas, and the three of them watch as Ginny and Dean share a kiss at their corner table. Ron, clearly upset, clenches his jaw and scowls at Harry before leaning on the table and raising his eyebrows at Hermione, who wipes butterbeer froth from her lip.\n\nOn their way back, Leanne and Katie walk ahead of them, adding to the tense atmosphere.",

    "607": "In the heartwarming opening, a young blond boy sits cross-legged, captivated by the flickering black and white images on a large wooden TV set. The scene transitions to an award ceremony, where seated guests applaud as a movie clip rolls. Among the audience, a man sits nearby a slender and beautiful Sophie, who is visibly shocked as a woman on stage announces her name. Beside her, Sidney beams with joy and claps enthusiastically. Sophie, a shapely raven-haired woman, rises from her seat, drawing the room's attention. Sidney briefly turns to the camera before a smartly dressed couple stands up from a nearby table, snapping camera phone pictures of Ricky Gervais.\n\nLater, Sidney is seen standing at a red rope barrier, grinning widely as he holds a pig on a leash. Sophie, looking nervous, lifts the barrier, allowing Alison to lead Sidney and the pig away. The backdrop shifts to the elegant Haymarket Hotel, where Sidney is disguised as a waiter, complete with a fake mustache. His canine companion, Britney, wags her curly tail, eagerly snatching a canape tossed by Sidney. With his face obscured by a tray of canapes, Sidney casually strolls into the party, breezing past a stern Nazi Clipboard woman. He finds himself seated by a pool, engaged in conversation with Thandie Newton, who smiling coyly, lets a burst of laughter and playfully pats Sidney on the thigh.\n\nMeanwhile, the brown-haired hotel manager knocks on Sidney's room door, only to discover the room has been trashed. Chocolates and booze bottles litter the floor near an open fridge, and upturned furniture is scattered about. Unnoticed, Britney trots out of the room, scurrying down the corridor to catch a lift, the electric doors closing behind her. Back at the party, Thandie's flirtatious smiles and sultry looks cause Sidney to grin bashfully, disturbing his fake mustache, which Thandie notices with a frown. Britney, now wandering out of the lift, causes a commotion by urinating on a lady's red high heels.\n\nThe PR Nazi pushes through the crowd, and Sidney spots Britney just as Thandie stands up. Bouncers approach, and Sidney scampers away, the PR Nazi watching hawkishly. Thandie shrugs as two bouncers give chase, a woman is pushed away in the chaos. Sidney takes a running jump, a photographer capturing him mid-flight. The following day, a newspaper features a photo of Clint Eastwood holding Sidney in a headlock, the Postmodern Review disparaging Sharp's editor.\n\nIn his busy living room-turned-office, Sydney, holding a lit cigarette, strides in to find his staff arguing amidst the ringing phone. The writers are gathered in a frenzy, watching a brewing fight, as the women dramatically flip over the fax machine. Outside, an airplane soars through the blue sky. That night, Sidney gazes wide-eyed at a sign over a theater entrance as he is swept through Chinatown in a taxi, his smile fading at the sight of a helicopter.",
    "616": "**Movie Description:**\n\nUnder the warm Sydney sun, the film opens with a focus on a charming red brick building. Inside, Sydney is busy in the kitchen, preparing a hearty breakfast of bacon, sausage, eggs, tomatoes, beans, and toast. Alison, dressed in his oversized pajamas, enters the room, rubbing her neck. She glances at a black and white photograph that had captured Richard's attention earlier. Sydney turns back to his cooking, and Alison takes a seat, only to rush out with a hand over her mouth, seemingly nauseated by the sight of the fry-up.\n\nMeanwhile, in the living room, Sydney plumps a cushion on his leather sofa and picks up his father's book from the coffee table, accidentally knocking over Alison's handbag. As he hurriedly collects the spilled contents, he finds a red notebook embossed with a gold butterfly. After a furtive glance around, he opens it and begins to read. He looks up to find Alison watching him, but she simply shrugs and starts gathering her things from the coffee table. She pauses, holding a record—the soundtrack to *La Dolce Vita*—and smiles as Sydney takes the battered sleeve from her. As he puts the record on, he starts to dance, inviting Alison to join him with a wry smile. They dance together, a playful jive, under the watchful gaze of Sydney's mother, whose photograph sits on a nearby shelf.\n\nThe scene shifts to Sydney's building, nestled among lush green trees and other apartment blocks, dwarfed by distant skyscrapers. Inside, Alison is at her desk while her colleague, Ingrid, sorts through dresses with another model. Sydney listens at the door but dashes for the fire exit as Alison crosses the office, setting off the alarm. A crowd of office workers gathers, then disperses, leaving Alison to watch Sydney as he grabs a wildlife book from a shelf and walks away.\n\nLater, Sydney stands before his bathroom mirror, inserting fake fangs and wrinkling his nose. Dressed in white face paint, a cape, and armed with a glass of wine, he finds Elena, dressed as Marlene Dietrich, chatting at a party. An Elvis Presley impersonator kisses a nun nearby. Sydney spots Alison, wearing a black wig and holding a cigarette in a long holder. He removes his fangs as Lawrence gives Alison a glass of champagne, kisses her cheek, and leaves. Sydney and Alison share an uncomfortable moment, shaking their heads and staring ahead as they sip their drinks. Sydney looks at her and sighs, the emotion between them palpable.",
    "621": "In the opening scene, a young woman named Juno hurriedly approaches the Lorings' front door, straightening the skirt she wears over her jeans. Peeking through one of the oval leaded windows, she then shares an image with Mark, who becomes deeply engrossed in it before turning his gaze to Juno. Juno's attention is drawn to a VHS tape nearby. Eagerly, Mark grabs the tape, and together they watch the sinister footage of a man driving a stake through a woman's stomach.\n\nJuno later shows the same picture to Vanessa, who scrutinizes it from various angles. Vanessa looks over at Mark, who respond with a nonchalant shrug. Standing with her arms tightly crossed, Vanessa watches as Mark hands Juno her bag, opens the door, and lets her out. Vanessa manages a forced smile for her husband. By the time Juno reaches home, it is dark, and she is sipping from a drinks carton. Inside, Bren is busy cutting out pictures of dogs. Juno, finishing her drink, pours the remaining liquid into Bren's ornament.\n\nOutside on the snowy street, Juno stops the Previa and removes her grey overskirt before Bleeker's mother opens the front door. Juno dashes upstairs, outpacing Bleeker's mother and reaching Bleeker's room first. Bleeker retrieves a box while Juno settles into a chair, legs apart, before sliding down to sit next to him. Both look away, feeling awkward, and Juno's expression turns glum.\n\nMeanwhile, at her home, Vanessa, dressed in an old T-shirt with her hair tied back, stands before a bare wall. Mark, arms folded, looks equally glum beside her. Vanessa nervously fiddles with the chain around her neck, both of them staring bleakly at the wall.\n\nLater, Juno and Leah are at the mall, crouching behind a glass balcony. Below, Vanessa is playing joyfully with a friend's little girl in the mall's play area. Leah stands up and turns away, but Juno remains, a soft smile spreading across her face as she watches Vanessa. Rising, they approach Vanessa, who shakes her head in disbelief. Juno flinches slightly before taking Vanessa's hand and placing it on her belly. Vanessa's face tightens self-consciously, and she kneels, placing her hands on Juno's swollen belly with a nervous glance around. Her eyes widen with excitement. Juno looks down at Vanessa with a mix of fondness and pride.\n\nBack at home, Bren is at the sewing machine, cutting the top off a pair of jeans and sewing on an elasticated band. She smiles, satisfied with her work as she tests the elastic.",
    "622": "Juno, sporting her adapted jeans, descends the school hallway, hands buried in the pockets of her baggy tartan parka. Her peers, eyes fixed on her pregnant belly, part ways to let her through. Meanwhile, at home, Mark is engrossed in composing music. During lunch in the school canteen, Juno and her friend Leah sit in an empty awards booth, Leah gazing dreamily at their tubby, bearded teacher.\n\nAt his locker, Bleeker suddenly looks up. Juno approaches him, her stare unyielding, causing Bleeker to shift his gaze uncomfortably. He briefly glances at Katrina before his head drops in dejection. Juno, with her canvas bag slung over her shoulder, walks away resolutely, leaving Bleeker watching her gloomily. She climbs into her dad's Previa, applies some lip balm, and starts the engine.\n\nMark, surfing the web on his PC, notices the blue van pulling up outside. Juno follows him downstairs, where he leads her into a cluttered basement room. She reads a title before her hands find their way to his waist. He lifts her hands to his neck, and they slowly sway together, her belly touching his, her eyes closed, head resting on his chest. Mark, however, seems unsettled, his chin brushing against her hair. Juno looks up, startled, staring at him in confusion.\n\nVanessa, laden with shopping bags, enters her spotless white kitchen. Mark lowers his gaze, and Juno starts to leave, bolting out the door, clutching her belly as she waddles to the Previa. Mark, dressed in a rock T-shirt over a long-sleeved undershirt, casts a cold look at Vanessa before retreating to his room. Vanessa, dejected, sinks onto the stairs, gazing unhappily into space.\n\nUnder a cloudy sky, Juno drives under a road bridge, passing a freight train. She pulls off the main carriageway onto the soft shoulder, next to a patch of dull green grass sprinkled with spring snow. Overwhelmed, she runs her hand over her belly and gives in to tears, oblivious to the passing cars. Her eyes stare straight ahead, seeing nothing in particular. Gradually, she starts to calm down. The car lights flash, and she pulls back onto the road, driving off.\n\nUp in his room, Bleeker plays his guitar as night falls. Juno, lying on the bonnet of the van with her hands tucked behind her back, stares up at the sky. Suddenly, she raises herself onto her elbows and climbs back into the van. Rumaging behind her, she finds a crumpled receipt, smoothes it out on the steering wheel, and starts to write.",
    "623": "In the heart of a pristine home, Vanessa sits alone at her dining table, slowly savoring a glass of red wine. Mark descends the stairs and approaches her, pulling up a chair with a faintly smug smile flickering across his face. His attention is abruptly drawn to the front door, where he catches a glimpse of Juno driving away. On the ground, he discovers a note she left behind. Vanessa swiftly seizes it, and together, they read its contents.\n\nMeanwhile, Juno parks her Previa outside her family’s wooden slatted house. The porch light highlights a straw heart hanging from the door knocker as she steps out, visibly exhausted both emotionally and physically. She pauses in the front garden to pluck a crocus, solemnly tracing a circle across her belly with its petal. Inside, her mustachioed dad, Mac, is busily fixing something at the kitchen table, the bright light gleaming off his bald head. Juno sinks into a chair beside him, their exchange silent but meaningful. Mac smiles to himself, his focus returning to his tinkering. Outside, through the slats on Bleeker's upstairs window blinds, Juno and Leah can be seen packing the Previa.\n\nThe next morning, as the track team runs past his house, Bleeker emerges from his front door. Opening the mailbox, he is greeted by a cascade of orange Tic Tac packs spilling onto his feet. He grins in delight. As the team sprints around the track, Bleeker’s attention is grabbed by Juno approaching him, moving past a lineup of cheerleaders rehearsing their routine. Smiling, he jogs to meet her. Juno takes his hand and places it on her belly, their eyes locking as he smiles. Bleeker, hands in the pockets of his brown sweatshirt and wearing skimpy yellow shorts, leans in to kiss her. Juno, standing on tiptoes, cups his face, her lips firmly locked onto his. A sullen secret admirer watches, while Leah, doing stretching exercises, grins. Juno responds with a less than friendly gesture, keeping her lips firmly on Bleeker’s.\n\nLater, Juno playfully drives a matchbox police car over the crest of her enormous belly, rolling her eyes as the toy slips from her grasp. Mac, Juno, and Bren then hurry out of the front door with Liberty Belly in her ballet outfit. At the hospital, Leah playfully steers Juno’s wheelchair into a gown trolley. In the birthing suite, Bren, Leah, and the midwife focus intensely on Juno as a squawking baby, still attached to his umbilical cord, enters the world. Juno looks long and hard at her newborn before closing her eyes. Bleeker, elsewhere, breaks through the finish line tape, then scans the crowd for her but in vain. He sprints up the steps of the stand and away.\n\nBack in the hospital room, Mac gently strokes Juno’s hair as she lies on her side in bed, their tender moment marking the close of a transformative journey.",
    "625": "In the gripping opening, Ray remains transfixed, staring straight ahead. A frown slowly etches onto his face as he lowers his gaze, his expression darkening. Graham, observing Ray closely, notes every shift in his demeanor. Ray bows his head, lost in thought, his guilty eyes avoiding Graham's steady gaze. With a deep breath, Ray turns slightly, his sad eyes lingering on Graham before starting the engine. He leans back in his seat, while Graham watches him intently, emotion welling in his eyes. Ray peers at Graham, seeing the struggle within him, his features contorted in a nod of silent agreement. Ray then drops his gaze once more.\n\nMeanwhile, at Ray's modest farmhouse, Merrill sits hidden in a closet, his eyes glued to a television screen displaying camcorder footage. His forehead is creased with worry, lips slightly parted in anxiety. He inches his chair closer to the TV, watching his frightened children inside the house. The youngsters huddle by the French windows, pointing frantically to the backyard where a party's remnants lie abandoned. The camera's lens zooms in on tall bushes, then swings back indoors, following the children as they rush to another window. Merrill's frustration mounts as he watches, helpless.\n\nSuddenly, a boy on the screen looks out towards a narrow passageway. The camera focuses on the area, capturing a eerie, lanky figure darting across and out of sight. Merrill jolts backward, hand cupped to his face in horror. He rewinds the footage, freezing the frame on the creature, the image flickering slightly as he stares, mouth agape.\n\nBack at Ray's house, Graham steps inside, pausing at the open kitchen door. He ventures into the room, finding chairs overturned and tables barricading the pantry door. A shadow flickers under the door as Graham inches towards it, the movement accompanied by an unsettling sound. He freezes, eyes locked onto the door, swallowing hard. With a slight nod to himself, he murmurs a silent charm, eyes clamped shut. The shadow stills. Graham glances away briefly, incredulous, then carefully lowers himself to his knees, pressing his face to the tiles to peer under the door. Finding only shards of glass, he sighs in relief. As he rises, he spots a large kitchen knife on the counter amidst chopped vegetables. After a moment's contemplation, he seizes the knife, steeling himself for what lies ahead.",
    "631": "In the dimly lit basement, Graham activates a device as Merrill kneels beside him. Merrill then carefully removes the pickaxe lodged under the doorknob and pulls open the door, revealing a stark stairwell. Cautiously, Merrill begins his ascent, the stairwell dreary and foreboding, with stark rays of sunlight filtering through the irregular holes in the wooden planks covering the kitchen window above.\n\nGraham watches intently from the basement as Merrill reaches the top of the stairs and surveys the area. Merrill turns left, momentarily disappearing from Graham's line of sight. Soon after, Merrill reappears, peering down the stairwell and giving a nod, signaling that the coast is clear. With a sense of urgency, Graham carefully carries Morgan up the stairs and into the disheveled kitchen, where chairs are scattered, and the fridge door hangs open. Bo follows closely behind her father, then curiously wanders into the hallway as Graham continues through the dining room and into the living room, his eyes fixed on the broken planks across the windows.\n\nThe living room bears signs of disarray: a table lamp lies on its side beneath a window, and a picture frame hung below a mounted baseball bat is askew. Apart from these details, the room appears otherwise untouched. Graham tenderly places Morgan on the sofa, his actions deliberate and careful.\n\nBo soon returns, her youthful energy evident as she performs a little dance, swinging her arms and thrusting her hips playfully. Graham's attention, however, remains fixed on Morgan. He then heads to the cupboard under the stairs, unplugs a television set, and carefully wheels the TV trolley down the hallway into the living room. Positioning it with precision, he crouches down to plug it in. As the screen flickers to life, Graham's expression shifts to one of horror. Reflected on the screen is a tall, humanoid figure silhouetted against the window, ominously holding Morgan across one of its arms.\n\nGraham slowly rises and turns to confront the creature, his movements tense and cautious. Meanwhile, Merrill enters from the dining room, stopping abruptly in his tracks, a syringe slipping from his grasp. The creature, with its highly domed head, glares between the two men, its alien features stark and unnerving. Graham's eyes are drawn to the creature's lower arm, which is wrapped around Morgan's back, the material matching his shirt. Notably, two of the creature's four clawed digits are missing, and Graham recalls using a knife outside Ray's pantry.\n\nThe alien extends its other hand over Morgan's face, tilting it at the wrist joint. A sharp spike emerges from the bottom of the wrist, held menacingly above Morgan's nose. In a moment of frozen terror, Merrill, Graham, and Bo stare in abject horror as the alien's gaze shifts from Morgan to Graham.\n\nGraham's scrutiny intensifies as he studies the creature's smooth-skinned, earless head, its mouth oddly shaped and revealing dull gray teeth. He glares into the alien's hooded eyes, his mind racing back to the scene of the accident. He remembers driving to the scene, Caroline waving her arms frantically in the road. Graham narrows his eyes slightly, recalling the moment he crouched by the front of Ray's pickup, his wife's head resting eerily on the bonnet. The tension and fear in the room are palpable as the critical moments unfold.",
    "637": "Graham's station wagon pulls up to Merrill's converted barn on the farm, signaling their return. Inside the car, Graham and Merrill unbuckle their seatbelts, their attention drawn to a buzzing noise emanating from the back. Morgan, seated beside Bo who is secured in a child's car seat, picks up a pale blue radio receiver and listens intently, his gaze directed skyward. Merrill sighs and turns away, while Graham watches his brother before turning back to Morgan, who hands him the receiver. Both brothers listen, their eyes locked, until Merrill sits back, exasperated.\n\nThe family exits the vehicle, but Bo freezes in shock. Merrill looks at Morgan thoughtfully, while Graham leans back into the car, standing up slowly as Merrill reaches out his hand. Together, they hold the receiver across the car roof as Morgan climbs up to take it. Bo attempts to join them but is gently restrained by Graham, who sits on the bonnet. Merrill assists Morgan, steadying him as he points the receiver skyward. Bo struggles to join them until Merrill takes her hand. Morgan slowly lowers the receiver, his gaze fixed on it, as Bo slides back down into Graham's lap.\n\nLater, Graham emerges from the farmhouse carrying a metal dish of dog food for Isabel. He steps into the dark night, walking steadily towards the chained Alsatian. Isabel, agitated, pulls at her chain, barking into the rustling maize field. Graham pauses, turning to face the crop, but recoils as Isabel lunges. He stares at the dog, then back at the field, his surprise evident. Opening a battered metal toolbox, he retrieves a large torch. Graham inches forward cautiously, illuminating the edge of the crop with the torch beam.\n\nWith a steady pace, he enters the tall, dense corn, the torchlight casting eerie shadows on the limp, straggly leaves. The leaves bend back as he pushes through them, venturing deeper into the narrow channel between the rigid stalks, the torch angled low to light his path.",
    "638": "In the depths of the night, Graham pauses at the entrance of a dense, foliage-covered tunnel, his torch beam piercing the darkness ahead. He sweeps the light across the impenetrable jungle, finding nothing but endless rows of stalks that barely allow the light to pass. With a sense of resolve, he lowers the flashlight and begins to navigate through the crop, using one arm to shield his face from the encroaching leaves.\n\nEmerging into the first of several crop circles, Graham cautiously lowers his arm. He comes to a halt, his eyes scanning the area with renewed apprehension. A pale gray light illuminates the vast, perfectly circular space, where the corn lies evenly flattened, the leaves glowing with a silvery sheen. Graham stands still, the beam of his torch cutting a slender path across the circle. His eyes dart nervously around the eerie scene. Taking a deep, steadying breath, he scans the circle once more before stepping backward toward the standing crop. With a swift turn, he plunges straight into the corn, struggling through the dense stalks until he stumbles upon a pathway running between two areas of maize.\n\nShining his torch along the path, Graham finds it clear in both directions. He stares intently into the crop, his heart pounding. Suddenly, he drops the torch, and the light goes out. Panting, he keeps his eyes fixed on the maize, crouching down warily to retrieve the flashlight. Frantically slapping the lens, he manages to restore the beam, which briefly illuminates his face. As he shines the light down the path, a long, thin, bare leg silently slips into the corn. Startled, Graham scrabbles backward before leaping up and sprinting in the opposite direction. He plows through the corn, the torchlight dancing over the leaves as he runs.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the farmhouse, Morgan and Bo are washing up at the kitchen sink, which opens directly onto the lounge. Merrill sits at a table, engrossed in an army pamphlet he picked up in town, lazily chewing gum. Unnoticed, Graham enters the kitchen and silently takes a seat at the table, his eyes fixed on the floor. His children turn around and see their father, his expression downcast. Morgan approaches the table tentatively, leaving Bo at the sink. Merrill glances over his shoulder and notices his brother's dejected state. Rising from his seat, he heads into the kitchen, stopping just short of the table. Graham looks up at Merrill, sits up straight, and sighs heavily.\n\nOn the television screen, mysterious lights hover in the night sky, capturing the attention of Graham and Merrill, who sit silently on the sofa. Morgan and Bo kneel close to the TV, their eyes wide with curiosity and a hint of fear. The room is filled with a sense of both wonder and unease as they all stare at the enigmatic display.",
    "640": "Graham's journey begins with a moment of hesitation as Bo points at something, causing him to falter. He opens a book, his uncertainty evident. Morgan hands him the book, and Graham starts to flip through the pages, his dubious nod highlighting his skepticism. Morgan and Bo watch intently as Graham discovers a series of unsettling illustrations: a sketch of an extraterrestrial with a teardrop-shaped head and large catlike eyes, a blue-green alien with an angular jaw and black almond-shaped eyes, and a nighttime drawing of a UFO firing red laser beams into a burning farmhouse. Flames engulf the upstairs windows, and three shadowy bodies lie on the lawn—an adult and two children. Morgan and Bo stare at the chilling image, while Graham's eyes flick pensively from side to side.\n\nSuddenly, they all jump back, startled. Graham takes the book and leaves, answering a phone call on the landing. He stands still, the receiver pressed to his ear, glancing into a room with a dressmaker's dummy. Now dressed, Graham descends the stairs, retrieves a coat from the closet, and picks up some keys, leaving Merrill confused as he remains glued to the TV. Meanwhile, Morgan and Bo observe clouds through a telescope, Bo's worried expression and slow, deliberate nod conveying her concern. She hugs Morgan's arm, avoiding eye contact.\n\nGraham's next stop is the house of Vet. Ray Reddy. He opens the screen door, peers through the slats of the wooden door, and then gently closes it. Stepping back, he scans the area before walking along the veranda. He reaches a closed window and looks into an office, noticing a wooden chair lying upturned and a toppled vase, the naked bulb still glowing. Graham views the scene with restrained alarm and backs away.\n\nTurning, he spots a brown Chevy 4x4 parked on a short driveway, a figure at the wheel. Graham approaches cautiously, leaning in through the lowered passenger side window. Ray, the Asian man who stayed in town, sits with one hand clamped to the steering wheel, rocking nervously and staring numbly ahead. In the back are bundles of clothes, and Graham notices a bloodstain on Ray's check shirt, his inquisitive frown deepening as he takes in the troubling scene.",
    "644": "In a swift moment, Jamal hurriedly downs his drink. Meanwhile, the inspector begins to exit the room, ultimately leaving Jamal alone.\n\nOutside, Jamal finds himself standing before Javed's opulent residence. Peering through the windows, he notices the house has been largely emptied of its furnishings. Overwhelmed with frustration, he bangs his head against the door. Exhausted, he stares down at the ground.\n\nElsewhere, a news report plays on a television. Salim and Latika exchange glances before turning their attention back to the screen. As Latika watches, a prominent scar is visible along her cheekbone. She is in a room filled with girls, thugs, and Javed himself. Suddenly, she spots Jamal on the TV. Javed, noticing this, abruptly changes the channel and gestures for the girls to start dancing. Latika takes this opportunity to slip out of the room. Salim soon realizes she's gone.\n\nIn the main room, scantily clad girls mingle with the thugs. One of the girls attempts to dance with Javed while he is on the phone, but he quickly dismisses her. Seeking a quieter space, he moves to another room. Salim observes the girls with indifference before leaving to join Latika next door.\n\nIn the quieter room, Latika wipes away her tears. Salim approaches her, holding out a set of keys, which she accepts. He shakes his head, takes out his phone, dials a number, and then hands the phone to her. Gently, he strokes her cheek near the scar. Holding the door open for her, he ensures she leaves safely before closing the door behind her. Latika rushes towards Salim's car.\n\nBack in the main room, Salim returns to find Javed still engrossed in his phone conversation. Meanwhile, Latika starts the car and drives off at high speed, navigating through packed roads. Srinivas throws water on the dozing Jamal to wake him.\n\nAs Jamal arrives at the studio in a police van, crowds cheer and cameras flash. Inside, studio lights illuminate the scene as technicians prepare the equipment. The commotion attracts an old woman who spots Jamal in the van. The crowd swells, cheering enthusiastically. Across the country, people gather in front of their TVs to watch the unfolding events. Latika, however, finds herself stuck in a major traffic jam, eventually coming to a halt in gridlocked traffic.\n\nPeople congregate outside electrical shops, watching the broadcast on TVs displayed in the windows. Families gather around their televisions, enjoying supper while engrossed in the show. At the Excel Five Call Center, the main room is practically empty, except for a manager who walks in and sees Jamal appear on the screen. The TV room, in contrast, is packed with staff eagerly watching.\n\nIn the studio, the host guides Jamal to his chair. Meanwhile, on the street, Latika decides to abandon her car and walk. She stops outside an electronic shop and joins the crowd watching Jamal on the screen. Jamal, seated in the studio, smiles as he recollects memories of his teacher beating him with a book and sheltering from the rain as a child, musing that she could have been the third musketeer.",
    "641": "In a dimly lit interrogation room, a heavyset policeman exhales a cloud of cigarette smoke across the table, directing it into the face of a young male prisoner, who is shivering with fear and sweating profusely. The captive, Jamal Malik, blinks rapidly as the acrid smoke irritates his eyes. Abruptly, the policeman lurches forward across the table.\n\nMeanwhile, a question materializes on a game show screen, and rupee notes flutter to the floor. The spotlight shifts to the show's charismatic host, who turns his attention to Jamal, waiting nervously in the wings of the studio. Together, they walk to their chairs, centrally positioned on the studio stage.\n\nBack in the grim police cell, Jamal's head is brutally forced into a bucket of water by the policeman. The scene shifts again, this time to a bustling train platform where a beautiful young woman stands, her face lighting up with a smile.\n\nThe inspector enters a gloomy room where Jamal is suspended off the floor, his wrists painfully bound. Srinivas, under duress, sets up a car battery and connects jump leads to Jamal's big toes. Despite his predicament, Jamal defiantly glares into the inspector's eyes. The inspector moves away as Srinivas activates the battery, sending electric currents through Jamal's body. The inspector approaches Jamal's now limp form, noticing his closed eyes and the dribble escaping his mouth. Leaning in, the inspector scrutinizes Jamal's face. Suddenly, Jamal stares back, and both policemen turn towards him in slow disbelief as he spits blood.\n\nIn a flashback to Jamal's childhood, a group of ragged boys in dirty clothes play cricket on a makeshift runway. Young Jamal stumbles, missing the ball, and the other boys mock him. Suddenly, the boys scatter as security men, wielding long truncheons, approach. One boy makes a rude gesture before they all dash away, high-fiving each other as they clamber across a rubbish tip, over corrugated rooftops, and into the narrow alleyways of their slum.\n\nThe security men pursue on foot, struggling to keep up as the boys navigate the filthy, winding streets. Some boys hurl rubbish from the rooftops, slowing the guards down. One determined guard chases Salim and Jamal down a walkway, past a river choked with rubbish, and along a sewage pipe. The boys collide with a Mercedes, where the local gangster, Javed, sits barking orders. As the guard also crashes into the car, the boys slip away, only to run into their mother, who drags them to school.\n\nThroughout these transformative scenes, the narrative seamlessly blends the harsh realities of Jamal's past and present, intertwined with his unlikely journey through a game show, all culminating in a gripping tale of resilience and defiance.",
    "648": "In a grimy room, a man meticulously carries a spoon filled with liquid to a table. He forcefully opens Arvind's eyelids, pouring the mysterious substance into his eyes. Salim, unable to stomach the sight, kneels and vomits, while Maman observes coldly. The bearded man binds Arvind's eyes with a bandage, sealing his fate with a patronizing pat. Maman turns to Salim, giving him a nod of acknowledgment. The bearded man readies another dose of the liquid, sending a wave of shock across Salim's face, freezing him in place. Maman approaches Salim, crouching down to look him directly in the eye before signaling Punnoose to tail him.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamal begins to dance, oblivious to the danger lurking nearby. Salim appears, and after a quick handshake, Jamal follows him back to Maman, with Punnoose trailing behind. Salim leads Jamal towards Maman and his bearded accomplice, Latika secretly watching from afar. Maman and his henchmen are taken aback by Jamal's unexpected presence, unaware that Latika is quietly amused, witnessing Jamal pocket a 50 rupee note. Punnoose instructs Salim to pick up a cloth and a bottle of chloroform, but Salim defiantly hurls the contents into Punnoose's face. Chaos erupts as Salim, Jamal, and Latika flee, pursued by Maman, Punnoose, and the bearded henchman through a dense forest.\n\nThe children reach a railway siding, desperately chasing a departing train. Salim takes the lead, grasping the last carriage, with Jamal quickly following suit. Latika trails behind, with the men closing in on her. Salim reaches out his hand, but as Latika's fingers brush his, he abruptly pulls back, leaving her stranded on the tracks. Maman swoops in, snatching Latika as Jamal looks on in stunned disbelief.\n\nThat night, Jamal finds himself in a dark railway carriage, surrounded by watchful eyes. Back at the game show, the host stares at Jamal, his journey having led him here. In a stark contrast, a younger Jamal and Salim sit atop a moving train, Salim comforting his pensive brother. The boys traverse the Indian countryside, selling goods to passengers, and finding makeshift beds in sacks of vegetables. Their voyage is fraught with peril, as a guard callously rouses them and ejects them from the train. Undeterred, Salim ingeniously hoists Jamal up onto the roof of another train using a rope. Exhausted, the brothers doze, gripping each other's hands as the train speeds through the vast landscapes.",
    "649": "In a daring maneuver, Salim lowers Jamal by his legs through an open window into a train carriage, where a family is enjoying a lavish spread of pickles, rice, vegetables, and chapati. A sharp-eyed boy in a turban catches Jamal as he snatches a couple of chapatis, alerting his father with a nudge and a point. The father swiftly grasps Jamal through the window, leading to a struggle as Jamal desperately clings to the window frame. The father's forceful tug causes Jamal to lose his grip, sending both brothers tumbling down a slope beside the moving train.\n\nBreathless, the boys eventually sit up, and Jamal's gaze fixates on the horizon. As the dust settles, the resplendent Taj Mahal emerges in the distance, its white marble gleaming. The brothers venture through an entryway, awestruck by the monument's grandeur. Amidst the sea of tourists’ footwear, Jamal and Salim pilfer a pair of trainers each, ignoring a sign requesting tourists to collect receipts for guided tours. Leaning against the doorway, Jamal observes as crowds of tourists file past.\n\nA middle-aged couple approaches Jamal, and the man offers him money, which Jamal swiftly pockets. Outside the Taj Mahal, Jamal begins taking Polaroid photographs of tourists, while Salim deftly steals their shoes as they pose. The brothers then sell the stolen shoes from a makeshift store. By night, they relax around a campfire, smoking a hookah pipe and drinking with friends, Salim now sporting fancy leather cowboy boots.\n\nTheir days are filled with Jamal soliciting tourists as a guide and Salim counting stacks of cash. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist, showing her a picture of Princess Diana posing in the same spot. However, their escapade is cut short when security guards spot and chase them off. Undeterred, Jamal leads a tourist couple to a riverside, while Salim and his gang break into the tourists' Mercedes taxi and steal the tires, timed perfectly as Jamal returns with the tourists.\n\nAccused and assaulted by the Indian driver, Jamal endures a beating until the tourist wife subtly prompts her husband to hand Jamal a $100 bill. That night, Jamal tends to his black eye by a pool, his gaze drawn towards the sound of distant music. Following the melody, he walks through a forest and arrives at an outdoor stage, where he and his gang scamper across the scaffolding, picking pockets from the entranced audience below. Despite the theft, Jamal finds himself captivated by the singers on stage, momentarily lost in the magic of the performance.",
    "654": "In the opening scene, Peter acknowledges something with a nod, standing with a vacant expression and a foolish grin. He nods again and watches a woman depart, receiving a small wave from her. With a crestfallen look, Peter then walks away down the street. Later, he enters the apartment he shares with Harry, where Norman Osborne is on the phone. Peter saunters over to Harry, who looks up and then, appearing slightly embarrassed, turns to face both Peter and Norman. Harry reads aloud the Bugle's reward offer for a photograph of Spider-Man.\n\nMeanwhile, an armored car is hoisted, and a camera is suspended in a web. Spider-Man swiftly enters the scene, taking down five robbers with agile moves, including a double flip, and kicks a gun away from one of them before pinning him down. He then turns to face the camera. A photograph of Spider-Man swinging off a roof, crawling down a building, and saluting the cops is reviewed by the Bugle's editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Peter hands his photographs to a girl at a desk, who writes him a check. Peter has his camera slung around his neck.\n\nAcross the city, in the towering Oscorp building, Norman chairs a meeting with ten board members. He rises and fixes his gaze on Henry Balkan, who sits directly opposite him, calmly sipping coffee. Norman wipes his mouth, and a lopsided grin spreads across his face.\n\nIn bustling Times Square, filled with colorful balloons and costumed revelers, Peter is present with his camera. He snaps photos and aims his camera at a balcony high up on a massive stone building, where he sees Harry with MJ, who is wearing a vibrant Chinese dress. Harry attempts to kiss her, but she turns her head away. From below, Peter watches them intently. Harry and MJ turn to go inside, and Peter senses something amiss, looking around uneasily. Harry meets an Oscorp board member in a wheelchair.\n\nPeter's gaze shifts to the sky, where an object is moving towards the crowd from behind a building adorned with a singular wireless cubed top and other advertising hoardings. Everyone turns to look up, and Balkan watches through binoculars. Astride the glider is a figure in a stolen green flight suit, resembling a goblin with a sharp, featured head, long pointy ears, large yellow eyes, a nose, and bared teeth. The glider circles the tall building and heads towards the balcony, weaving past giant balloon figures floating above the festival. The goblin figure laughing, hurls something at the building, causing explosions that rip out the windows and the floor below the balcony.",
    "656": "In the heartwarming opening, MJ smiles affectionately. Later, she's engaged in a phone conversation with Harry, unaware that Peter is listening in, a grin spreading across his face. Abruptly, MJ ends the call, leaving Harry hanging on the line. Meanwhile, Harry, nursing a wound on his head, approaches Peter, his discomfort evident as he averts his gaze and shifts uncomfortably. Peter, lost in thought, observes this exchange silently.\n\nThe scene shifts to the opulent Osborn residence, where Norman is seen pouring himself a hefty drink from an ornate decanter. He downs it in one swift gulp. Startled by a sudden noise, he turns, his movements almost trance-like. Norman scans the room uncertainly, his eyes eventually landing on the eerie reaching masks arranged on a shelf against the wood-paneled wall. He stares at them intently before spinning around to face his reflection in a mirror. His reflection begins to speak, and Norman watches, transfixed, as it chuckles menacingly.\n\nBack in the bustling city, Hoffman is already settled in the office when mayhem unfurls. A cigarette discarded by Jameson is tossed back inside, and in a dramatic burst, the Green Goblin storms in, grasping the editor by the throat. From outside, a sinister vapor emanates from the Green Goblin's gloves, targeting Spider-Man, who is hanging upside down. Overpowered, Spider-Man goes limp and plummets towards the ground, only to be caught mid-fall by the Green Goblin on his glider. The villain whisks the unconscious hero away to a rooftop before leaping back onto his glider and vanishing into the night.\n\nUnder the cloak of darkness, MJ emerges from a doorway, discarding something in a nearby bin. Peter swiftly approaches, his nervousness evident as he gulps, while MJ raises an eyebrow and greets him with a gentle smile. The city lights gleam around them as MJ crosses the street and rounds a corner, Peter's gaze following her closely. He notices two youths eyeing MJ and springs into action, his stance protective.\n\nAs rain begins to fall, MJ quickens her pace, the two youths close on her heels. Peter, now perched on a rooftop, swiftly changes out of his everyday attire. Two more youths join the pursuit, and MJ finds herself cornered in a dimly lit backstreet by the gang of four. One assailant grabs her shoulder, but she retaliates fiercely with her bag and feet. A switchblade is drawn, but before any harm can be done, webs shoot from the shadows, pulling the assailants away from MJ.\n\nSpider-Man, unmasked, descends from above, taking on the four men with his superior strength. Two of the thugs crash through windows behind MJ, and the final assailant is subdued in the shadows. As MJ approaches, Spider-Man retreats down an alleyway, vanishing from sight. Reappearing moments later, mask firmly in place, he descends a wall headfirst, his gaze fixed on MJ. She reaches up, her hands lifting his chin, and slowly peels away his mask, revealing his neck, chin, and finally, his lips.\n\nThe narrative crafts a seamless blend of emotional depth, suspenseful action, and a burgeoning romance, setting the stage for a captivating superhero saga.",

Unbeknownst to him, Peter is clinging to the ceiling in his Spider-Man costume, noticing a trickle of blood running down his arm, about to drip. As everyone exits, leaving Norman alone, the blood drop falls, echoing in Norman's enhanced hearing. Intrigued, he spots the blood and looks up, but Peter has already vanished. Norman, suspicion aroused, investigates the open window, leaning over the balcony to scan the area.\n\nLater, Peter, now out of costume, enters through the front door. Norman is seated at the head of the dinner table, with Peter sitting opposite Mary Jane and Harry. Aunt May presents an enormous turkey, but Norman is more interested in sharpening a carving knife, wearing a malevolent sneer as he eyes Aunt May. She, in turn, notices blood seeping through Peter's shirt, drawing Norman's glare. Tension escalates as Norman points the knife at Peter, then abruptly leaves, followed by Harry. Their heated conversation is overheard by all. A dejected Harry returns, with Peter and MJ exchanging glances.\n\nMeanwhile, Norman, back in his living room, converses with the Goblin mask. Suddenly, an explosion rips through Aunt May's bedroom wall, and the Green Goblin glides in, leaving her on the floor. Peter later rushes to the hospital, only to be pushed out of her room. Distraught, he leans against the corridor wall, his bright blue eyes darting nervously before he sits by his sedated aunt's bedside. He holds her hand, looking at a family photograph before speaking.\n\nThe next day, MJ visits with flowers. She and Peter sit together, MJ smiling as Peter gazes into her eyes, then looks down. Unnoticed, Aunt May has awakened and overheard their conversation, smiling before drifting back to sleep. MJ reaches out, gently taking Peter's hand in a moment of shared tenderness.",
    "659": "As a door swings open, Harry steps in, holding a bouquet tightly. MJ quickly pulls her hand away from Peter's, causing Harry's expression to fall. An awkward silence hangs among the trio. Later, Harry enters the dim, arched living room of the Osborne residence. Drawn by voices, he ascends the grand staircase, where his father, Norman, appears on the landing. Harry reaches out, arms wide, but Norman merely leans on the intricately carved railing. Harry continues up, sullen, while Norman looks down, shaking his head. Harry pauses, sighs, then looks puzzled as Norman descends and embraces him. Harry's eyes flutter closed, tears brimming.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter lies on his aunt's bed, a coy expression on his face. Turning thoughtful, he suddenly looks alarmed and rushes to a hospital payphone. His eyes widen as he sees MJ unconscious, her hair and nightclothes fluttering in the breeze. She stirs, standing on a high metal platform above the city. MJ steps back, steadying herself, as traffic hums below on Queensboro Bridge. She's on one of the bridge's towers when the Green Goblin approaches, gliding menacingly. He swoops down, missing MJ but heading towards a cable car filled with children and adults. With a blast, he destroys the cable-car station, causing chaos on the bridge.\n\nWatching from a nearby rooftop, Spider-Man springs into action. A massive metal wheel flies through the air, a cable snaps, and the Roosevelt Island cable car begins to plummet. The Green Goblin grasps the cable, halting the fall. Spider-Man stretches a web between two flagpoles, using it as a slingshot to launch himself into the air. He shoots webs, navigating the steel girders until he lands on a metal strut. Above, the Goblin holds MJ and the cable car's cable, kids screaming inside. He drops both, MJ and the cable car plunging downward. Spider-Man, seeing the reflections in his mask's eyes, rushes to catch MJ mid-fall, then swings underneath the bridge to save the cable car with his webbing.",
    "660": "In a daring rescue attempt, Spider-Man secures a web network to a bridge, aiming to stabilize a precariously dangling cable car. Inside, MJ and Spider-Man struggle as the web strains to support them and the car. Suddenly, the Green Goblin appears, gliding towards them after spotting a nearby tugboat. The web begins to fray, causing a abrupt 20-foot drop. Panicked, MJ climbs over Spider-Man and starts descending the cable. The Goblin attacks, punching Spider-Man and forcing him to extend his arms wide, one clutching the web and the other grasping the cable. Another blow sends Spider-Man reeling, dislodging the cable from his grip, but he swiftly recovers it. MJ loses her footing but manages to grab onto the cable car's roof rail.\n\nAs Spider-Man carefully lowers the cable car towards a barge, the Green Goblin closes in, only to be struck by debris thrown by the crowd on the bridge. Spider-Man capitalizes on the distraction, kicking the Goblin away. The cable car lands safely, with MJ still holding on. However, their relief is short-lived as the Goblin returns, ensnaring Spider-Man with a line and dragging him away.\n\nSpider-Man is thrown through the wall of an old ruin, shoots a web to steady himself, and crashes through a glass pane. A pumpkin bomb explodes, sending him backwards through a brick wall. Badly injured and half his mask burnt off, Spider-Man faces the Goblin's relentless assault. Punched, kicked, and thrown, Spider-Man attempts to escape with his webs, but the Goblin thwarts his efforts. Desperate, Spider-Man constructs a large web to slow down the Goblin, but it buys him little respite.\n\nBeaten and battered, Spider-Man crashes into a wall and collapses. As the Goblin's boot crushes his wrist, Spider-Man's eyes blaze with determination. The Goblin lunges with a multi-bladed spear, but Spider-Man stops it mere inches from his face.

Seizing the initiative, Spider-Man bombards his foe with a barrage of blades. The Goblin crashes to the ground, where he removes his mask, revealing his true identity: Norman Osborn. Peter, beneath the Spider-Man costume, is aghast.\n\nMeanwhile, a remote on Peter’s glove has activated the Goblin’s glider, which now targets Spider-Man with blades drawn. With a swift backward flip, Spider-Man evades the glider, but it veers towards Norman. The blades pierce through him, pinning him to the wall. Norman, in his final moments, looks up at Peter, whose identity is now exposed. Norman then collapses over the glider, his lifeless eyes staring wide. Nearby lies the discarded mask of the Green Goblin. Peter hangs his head in grief.\n\nLater, under the cover of darkness, Peter places Norman's body, now free of his villainous attire, on a sofa in the Osborn mansion study. As he does, Harry enters the room, dressed in black. Startled by the sight of his father's body and the shadowy figure of Spider-Man, Harry scrambles to find a gun from the desk. By the time he looks up, Spider-Man has vanished, leaving the curtains billowing and the window open.\n\nAt Norman's funeral, with the burial complete, Harry stands alone.

The pincers, now closed, resemble serpents' heads poised to strike. Octavius blinks, then raises an eyebrow, as if acknowledging the inevitable. More debris is sucked into the vortex, and the limbs, seemingly sentient, turn threateningly towards Octavius' face. The pincer around Peter's neck loosens slightly, but another limb prevents him from escaping. Helplessly, the unmasked Spider-Man watches as the four mechanical limbs lift Octavius and carry him towards the golden orb floating in the fusion chamber.\n\nAs they approach the orb, the limbs halt abruptly. Octavius turns, his face a mask of grim determination. The two men lock eyes, a silent understanding passing between them. Octavius turns back and lunges towards the sphere. Behind him, Spider-Man spins around to see Mary Jane Watson, her face a picture of incredulity as she recognizes him. Her shock melts into a warm smile, but the moment is shattered as Peter spots a girder toppling towards her.\n\nWith the whole side of the building crashing down, Spider-Man sprints to hold it up, standing protectively over MJ. He looks down at her intensely, his body bent under the immense weight. Meanwhile, beneath the fusion chamber, Octavius uses the limbs to remove the support girders. The chamber and the lab begin to sink, and Peter struggles to hold up the side wall, nodding grimly as the chamber crashes down into the river, taking the sphere and Octavius with it.\n\nSummoning all his strength, Peter hurls the side wall after the collapsing chamber. He quickly turns to MJ, removing a wooden beam that has trapped her. As they prepare to escape, they see a revolving mass of metal speeding towards them. Holding MJ in his arms, Spider-Man leaps up and uses a web to carry them away from the sinking laboratory, leaving the chaos behind.",
    "681": "In the dull quiet of a corporate lobby, a receptionist, her jaw working a piece of gum, glances at the clock. It's three minutes past two. Meanwhile, Peter, his expression neutral, systematically unties the fasteners securing the stack of pizzas. He briefly looks up at the receptionist, then retreats towards the janitor's closet he had initially emerged from. The receptionist's eyes follow Peter suspiciously as he abruptly turns towards the elevators he had previously ignored. He summons the elevator with a press of a button, steps inside, and selects his desired floor. As the doors begin to close, he flashes the receptionist a warm smile and a wave.\n\nBack at Joe's Pizza, Mr. Aziz scrutinizes the enthusiastic young Peter, stepping closer to peel the Joe's Pizza sticker off his helmet. Later, at the Bugle, Peter submits his delivery receipt to Miss Brant, who playfully chucks his chin before walking off, leaving Peter with a self-conscious grin.\n\nThe scene shifts to a bustling university campus, where Peter weaves through the crowded pathways, accidentally bumping into a fellow student. He stoops to retrieve his book, but other students obstruct his way, standing on his belongings, their bags swinging into him. As he straightens up, Dr. Connors, a thin-faced man with a furrowed brow and an empty right sleeve, pauses briefly before continuing on his path.\n\nUnder the cover of night, Peter steers his moped into the garden of a suburban home. Once inside, he removes his helmet, satchel, and jacket, his gaze fixed on Harry Osborn. Harry, in turn, watches MJ depart, his brow creasing as he looks at Peter, who stares back impassively. When Peter fails to respond, Harry rises and retreats, his hands firmly planted on his hips. He pauses to examine a framed photograph of his father with Peter. Peter reaches out, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder.\n\nThe room suddenly darkens as the lights go out, and Peter leans over to extinguish the candles on his birthday cake. Later, Aunt May dozes at the table, surrounded by letters and papers. Peter circles the table to grasp her hand, causing her to reach into her purse. Tears begin to well up in Peter's eyes as Aunt May plants a soft kiss on his cheek before walking away. Peter struggles to hold back his emotions, quickly gathering the trash and stepping out into the backyard.\n\nHe ventures to the far end of the garden, oblivious to MJ seated on the neighboring steps. She approaches him, and Peter's gaze locks onto her. She leans over the fence, inching closer to him. Peter's eyes dart from hers to her mouth, both of them frozen in the moment. He attempts to speak, but only manages to shake his head, lowering his gaze. MJ's eyes remain fixed on him, awaiting his words. He looks up once more, trying to muster a smile.",
    "688": "In a chilling moment, a menacing figure spins around, a wicked smile spreading across his face as he enters a dilapidated building, his mechanical limbs moving with eerie autonomy. A pincer extends threateningly towards him, but the limbs swiftly lift him up, his arms spreading wide.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter is at a bank. Suddenly, Aunt May kicks the bank clerk and shows him a newspaper clipping, studying it intently. The clerk smiles, stands up, and limps away. Across the banking hall, Otto Octavius, concealed under a long coat and trilby, stands before the steel vault door. He tosses the hat aside, revealing his mechanical limbs that begin to hurl bulging money sacks into yellow bags. Aunt May watches in shock as Peter dashes around the corner, the clerk now standing beside her.\n\nOctavius's mechanical limbs toss the guards aside effortlessly. One pincer removes his hat, while others stuff money into bags. Sensing something, Octavius turns just as Spider-Man swoops in. A flurry of money bags is hurled at the web-slinger, who deftly swings up to the ceiling, catching a bag with his web and sending it crashing into Octavius. Spider-Man loses his footing, a bag of coins hitting him squarely. A gold coin rolls to the bank clerk, who tries to pocket it, but Aunt May swiftly smacks his hand away.\n\nThe mechanical limbs seize Spider-Man, two pincers gripping his head and squeezing tightly. Desperately, Spider-Man fires a web, raising his arms to shield himself as the limbs smash a desk. A display case goes flying, hitting Octavius and sending him crashing onto a yellow cab outside.\n\nRegaining his footing, Octavius's limbs hurl Spider-Man back into the bank just as two police cars screech to a halt. One of the mechanical limbs grabs Aunt May as a human shield, and Octavius lumbers off with her in tow. In an office nearby, a girl ends her phone call and moves to the window, unaware of the chaos outside. A mechanical limb bursts through the wall as Octavius scales the building, three limbs propelling him upward while the fourth holds Aunt May.\n\nSpider-Man appears above, but Octavius drops Aunt May from a great height. A well-timed web catches her, pulling her back up. Below, Octavius slams Spider-Man against the building, but the hero fights on, punching free and scrambling up the wall. A mechanical limb snags him, and Aunt May watches in horror as the two figures trade blows, plummeting back towards the ground. At the last moment, one of Octavius's limbs secures a hold, leaving them both dangling precariously.",
    "691": "In the soft glow of a hazy morning, the sun ascends over the New York skyline. Peter, situated at his dilapidated residence, grasps a payphone, while simultaneously, Mary Jane gazes at her silent phone at home. She picks up the receiver, only to realize Peter has already hung up. He, however, pivots and answers another call. Captain Stacy presents a mugshot to Aunt May, which Peter swiftly seizes.\n\nA stark, black-and-white flashback engulfs Peter: his Uncle Ben sits defenseless in his car on a dimly lit street. Flint, menacing, taps a gun against the driver's window. Ben is brutally shoved to the ground as Flint's accomplice approaches, only to be waved off. The accomplice commandeers Ben's car, leaving Flint to callously execute Uncle Ben. A tear rolls down Peter's cheek as he envisions the chilling scene, his uncle crumpling lifelessly to the ground, the accomplice fleeing. Peter tosses Flint's photo onto the desk.\n\nLater, in his rundown apartment, Peter fidgets, lost in thought. His radio crackles to life, stirring him to yank open the door and lower the volume. Mary Jane, visibly upset, shoots him a scathing look before attempting to leave. Peter, his face exposed and eyes icy, raises the radio volume and retreats into his thoughts. Eventually, donning his Spider-Man suit, he fixates on the radio amidst photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. Propping his head against the doorpost, his melancholy deepens.\n\nAs lightning flickers, Peter relives his uncle's attack, oblivious to a creeping shadow. A sinister presence scales his bed, projecting a twisted black silhouette onto the wall. Peter's dream morphs into a nightmare: Uncle Ben staring into his killer's eyes, and the eerie tendrils ensnaring Peter’s hand, spreading relentlessly across his body. His grip tightens on the sheets, the malevolent growth overwhelming his torso, then his face. In his dreamscape, Peter thrusts Flint's accomplice out the window, but the tendrils engulf him.\n\nHe awakens with a jolt, finding his Spider-Man suit now an ominous black. Clinging to a skyscraper, he gazes at his reflection in a dark window before dropping onto a ledge. His fingers clench as he scales the building and propels himself into the air. Gliding between cars, he ascends to a lantern-adorned roof. Grasping a large lantern, he surveys the city, his black hood removed, revealing a transformed hero ready to confront the shadows of his past and the present danger.",
    "692": "In a bustling science lab, a mysterious small black globule slips away from a microscope, rolling determinedly towards Peter. Reacting swiftly, he traps it under a glass. Later, Peter returns home, his gaze immediately drawn to his Spider-Man suit hanging on a rail. He reaches for it but pauses, his attention shifting to a worn black trunk on the floor. Intrigued, he crouches down and lifts the lid, revealing a sleek black spider suit nestled inside. Peter considers the suit, and in a blink, the city witnesses the debut of a black-suited Spider-Man, plummeting from a towering skyscraper, web slinging through the urban jungle.\n\nMeanwhile, chaos reigns at a bank, its doors blown open, and an overturned taxi lying outside. Black Spider-Man lands on the street, noticing a peculiar trail of sand snaking down a grating. Suddenly, Eddie Brock, camera in hand, leaps out from a tucked away spot, snapping photos as the masked hero rips a heavy grill from the ground. Annoyed, Spider-Man smashes Brock's camera before disappearing down the manhole, leaving Brock to glare after him, while stealthily retrieving a smaller, backup camera as escort cars begin to arrive.\n\nDeep within a subway tunnel, Flint Marko, carrying two clear sacks stuffed with stolen banknotes, strides along the tracks. Unbeknownst to him, a flash of light exposes Black Spider-Man, stealthily crawling along the ceiling. Flint turns, sensing a presence, but sees nothing in the dim light. Suddenly, the black-suited figure materializes before him, dodging Flint's swift punch. Spider-Man deftly touches the stripes on a nearby train, using his environment to his advantage, and launches onto Flint, sending him tumbling off the tracks into a deep, dark tunnel, the stolen money scattering onto the tracks far below.\n\nA relentless pursuit ensues, with Black Spider-Man swinging on webs, clashing against Flint, who desperately attempts to escape on a parkour of trains. During their brutal struggle, Flint's head is brutally ground against the side of a passing train, and in a shocking twist, his body briefly transforms into Sandman. With newfound power, he sends Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains, but the hero retaliates, knocking sandy lumps out of Flint's face. Their battle rages on as they fall down a shaft, landing on a pipe midway which swiftly breaks, sending Flint crashing into a muddy puddle near his scattered money. To his horror, his arm turns to damp sand, and he watches as his hand disintegrates before his eyes.\n\nAbove, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, then swings down onto a colossal water pipe. With brutal efficiency, he tears it open, water jetting from the ruptured holes. Flint looks on in terror as a torrent of water surges towards him, slamming him against a grating, the force of the water dissolving his sandy body into oblivion.",

He holds it up, his anxious eyes calming as he gazes at the emblem on the chest. Meanwhile, in a lavish mansion, **Harry** turns off the TV and paces before a roaring fire, his head clasped in thought. He pauses before his father's portrait, then notices Peter, half-masked, standing nearby. Harry turns, revealing severe burns and scars across his cheek, eye, and throat, illuminated by the fire's glow. He regards Peter impassively, then shakes his head in disapproval. Stung, Peter departs through the balcony.\n\nLater, within the goblin lair, Harry retrieves a green goblin sword from the debris, a tear shining in his unmarred eye as he nods, his disfigured face hidden in shadow. **Bernard** quietly leaves him to his thoughts.\n\nUnder the vast New York night sky, a massive searchlight spotlights a yellow cab caught in a gigantic web. **Mary Jane**, trapped inside, looks around anxiously as the cab rocks, then plummets before catching on a lower web strand. Far below, a crowd gasps as **Spider-Man** swings into view, leaping from a flag-draped building, past reporter **Jennifer Dugan**, and soaring towards the dangling cab.\n\nSpider-Man lands atop the cab, but his relief is short-lived as **Venom** crashes into him, ripping off the cab's roof and sending Spider-Man sprawling onto the trunk. Venom's mask retracts, revealing **Brock**, who seizes Mary Jane. Outmatched, Spider-Man is hurled onto a lower web, his wrists ensnared by Brock's webbing. Brock lands atop him, tearing off Spider-Man's mask to expose Peter's face.\n\nAs Peter struggles, a suspended truck begins raining breeze blocks onto the cab, one of which lodges inside, ripping off a door. Mary Jane grapples with the heavy block, hoisting it above her head just as the symbiote mask re-engulfs Brock's face. With a mighty heave, she crashes the block down onto Venom's head, felling the snarling beast.",
    "702": "**Movie Description:**\n\nHarry extends a hand, which Peter grasps firmly, sealing their alliance. With a nod, Peter rises, and they both turn to confront their foes. Venom lunges at Peter, but Harry swiftly uses Peter as a human club, striking Sandman. Wielding his sky stick, Harry blasts Sandman's arm, shattering it like glass upon contact. Below, Jonah Jameson attempts to capture the scene, but his camera is empty, leaving him frustrated and glaring at a nearby girl.\n\nPeter and Harry dodge Sandman's massive fists while a cab plummets dangerously close to Mary Jane. She narrowly escapes, left dangling precariously. The duo swiftly maneuvers the sky stick, evading Sandman, but Mary Jane tumbles as her support snaps. Peter deftly guides the sky stick, leaps off, and catches her mid-air, sending the crowd into cheers as they land safely on a half-built skyscraper. Peter acknowledges the spectators with a nod, his mask torn and revealing his face partially.\n\nSandman retaliates, grabbing Harry, but Peter kicks sand into Sandman's eyes, momentarily blinding him. Enraged, Sandman strikes Peter, sending him soaring to an upper floor, out of reach. Peter then fires rockets from the sky stick, hitting Sandman and causing the massive creature to crumble and disintegrate, eliciting joyous whoops from the crowd.\n\nHigh atop the skyscraper, Peter searches for Venom. Suddenly, Venom attacks from above, sending Peter crashing into a girder. Peter is subdued, his wrists bound by Venom’s black threads, and endures brutal blows that rip off his mask. Venom holds a jagged metal bar to Peter's neck, his tendrils writhing across Brock's face. Just as Venom prepares to stab Peter, a pumpkin bomb slices into him.\n\nHarry intervenes, but Venom snatches the sky stick, causing Harry to fall and grab a rack of metal tubes.

    "704": "In the heart of a dimly lit room, a brown-haired girl grins warmth into her eyes as she extends her hand, dropping a delicate locket into Flint's massive palm. Flint's fingers swiftly enclose the locket, hiding it from view. Suddenly, the room is bathed in a reddish, pulsating light. Drawn by the commotion, Flint marches towards the window and deftly climbs out onto the fire escape. Emma, Penny's mother, watches Flint's retreating figure with a mix of warmth and skepticism etched on her face.\n\nMeanwhile, under the cover of darkness, Peter navigates his bicycle along a tranquil street, ultimately parking outside Aunt May's apartment. Inside, Aunt May's eyes shimmer with unshed tears as she gently brushes back a lock of her white hair and slides off her ring. Peter accepts the ring, his gaze locked with his aunt’s, who returns a heartfelt smile. Leaning in, they embrace tightly, finding solace in each other's arms.\n\nLater, Peter, his face lit up with a goofy grin, cruises along a bustling city street, the night air rushing past him. Abruptly, a masked figure in dark green descends on a hoverboard, whisking Peter onto the rooftops. The attacker headbutts Peter and silences him with a firm hand. Sharp blades spring from the attacker's forearms, viciously slashing at Peter’s abdomen.\n\nPeter manages to free himself from the hoverboard, firing a web thread that latches onto a towering skyscraper. Swinging from the thread, he shoots webbing projectiles, but the masked figure nimbly avoids them and slices through Peter's line. Peter plummets, only to be slammed into a high wall by his mystery assailant. Dazed, Peter looks up as the figure in dark green descends, revealing his identity by sliding back his visor—Harry.\n\nPeter narrowly dodges a massive punch from Harry, who then rips out the section of the wall Peter is clinging to. As Peter hangs onto the plummeting debris, Harry swoops down, shattering the chunk of wall into fragments. Peter swings away on a web thread, but Harry relentlessly pursues, thumping him through the air before hurling him through a window corner.\n\nAs Peter is flung out of the opposite shattered window, he catches a glimpse of Aunt May’s ring spiraling through the air. Desperately, he lunges for it, but Harry seizes him from behind. Both men find themselves precariously balanced on the narrow hoverboard, known as the Sky Stick, in a brutal struggle. Peter manages to throw Harry off and uses web threads to catapult himself down after the falling ring. The Sky Stick automatically zips down to rescue the falling Harry, but Peter successfully grabs the ring before being struck again by Harry, sending him tumbling onto a rooftop.\n\nExhausted but determined, Peter opens his fist to reveal the ring safely nestled in his palm. With Harry swooping down, Peter pivots and runs, clutching the precious item tightly.

    "712": "In a rush, they burst through a door into a gymnasium. Jack tenderly cups Rose's cheek, and she responds by placing her gloved hand over his. She then steps outside, Jack's gaze following her through the wavy glass of the window before looking down.\n\nLater, in the elegance of the first-class lounge, Ruth, Rose, the Countess, and another woman enjoy tea. Rose's attention is drawn to another table where a woman corrects the posture of a listless young girl, who then carefully places a napkin on her lap with her small, gloved hands.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack leans against a railing, staring intently into the sea, the wind tousling his hair. Rose approaches him from across the deck, and as he turns to face her, a smile lights up his face. She reaches out, and they clasp hands. Jack gently draws her closer, and Rose's eyes flutter shut.\n\nWith a supportive grasp, Jack helps Rose onto the bow's railing platform. Together, they step onto the lowest rung, Rose stretching her arms wide like wings. The wind catches her shawl, billowing it out behind her. Jack steadies her by placing his hands around her waist as her eyes open to the vast ocean view. Above them, black smoke billows from the ship's funnels. Jack reaches out, taking Rose's hands again, and leans in close. He wraps her arms around her waist, and as she turns to face him, they share a tender kiss. Rose's hand finds the back of Jack's neck, holding him close.\n\nA lifetime later, the sunken Titanic rests on the ocean floor. The elderly Rose turns from a monitor displaying the underwater remains of her former suite's fireplace. She addresses the crew of the salvage vessel, her memories vividly transforming the room back to its former glory. Young Rose and Jack enter, he rushing towards a painting while she opens the safe and retrieves the Heart of the Ocean necklace. Jack examines the blue diamond, shaking his head in awe before turning to Rose.\n\nIn their private moments, Rose removes the butterfly cone from her hair, letting it cascade down to her shoulders. Jack prepares a makeshift bed by dragging a settee to the room's center and arranging pillows. Sitting nearby, he opens a canvas bag, taking out a knife and a stick of charcoal, which he begins to sharpen. As Rose enters, holding a kimono closed with one hand, she playfully twirls a sash. Jack smiles as she steps closer, then leans back as she tosses him a dime. With a subtle seduction, Rose steps backward, letting the kimono slip from her shoulders to the floor. Standing naked, she runs her fingertips over her thigh, a moment of intimate vulnerability.",
    "716": "In the depths of the ship, water rushes into the cargo hold, overwhelming two stewards. Above, on the front well deck, Jack protectively pushes Rose back as chunks of ice break off from the iceberg and crash onto the deck, striking down two men. The ship grinds against the iceberg, continuing its fateful journey. In the engine room, water surges in, as a man scrambles past stokers swept across the room. Jack races to the starboard railing, watching in horror as the stern of the ship grinds along the iceberg.\n\nFirst Officer Murdoch dashes to the bridge, activating a lever that seals the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. A man desperately signals to the stokers, as workers sprint through the rising water, diving under the closing doors. One stoker barely escapes through the final door before it slams shut, leaving several others behind. On the bridge, lights on the watertight door indicator panel blink on, signaling the closure of the doors. Murdoch watches the panel, a look of grim realization on his face, before turning away.\n\nOn the passenger deck, curious onlookers gather at the starboard rail, gazing at the iceberg. High above, in the crow's nest, Fleet turns to Lee, their vigilant watch interrupted by the unfolding chaos. Jack, Rose, and the two men peer over the railing, witnessing the iceberg slowly receding into the distance.\n\nBack on the bridge, Murdoch confers with Moody, who checks the wall clock as he leaves. Hichens turns to see Captain Smith enter the bridge. Murdoch follows Smith onto the bridge deck, where the captain surveys the scene below from the bridge deck shelter, then takes his place at the railing, overlooking the front well deck. Murdoch hastily departs.\n\nIn the crew quarters, Fabrizio leaps from his bunk, splashing into inch-deep water. He turns on the light and opens the door, his roommates following close behind. Tommy approaches them, as the countess emerges from her stateroom, stopping a mustached steward in his tracks. Andrews rushes past, clutching blueprints, as smoke billows from the ship's funnels, and passengers congregate on the decks.\n\nTommy, Fabrizio, and others follow a stream of rats scurrying down a hallway, a sign of the impending disaster. Cal and Lovejoy exit the sitting room, stopping a dark-haired steward. The steward hurries away, as a dark-haired man on the upper deck tosses a chunk of ice to a blond man, who tosses it back, unaware of the grave situation unfolding.\n\nSmith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch pass Jack and Rose, as the master-at-arms examines Jack's drawings. Cal snatches the drawings away, tucking them under his arm. Holding hands, Jack and Rose approach Lovejoy, who deftly slips the Heart of the Ocean into Jack's coat pocket as he walks alongside them. Lovejoy follows the couple into the sitting room, where Cal awaits, glancing at Lovejoy with a knowing look.",

She notices a sign above a doorway and proceeds down a short passage, turning into a long hallway. Meanwhile, in an office, a handcuffed Jack climbs onto a desk to avoid the rising water. Rose pauses at a staircase before turning left into another corridor, filled with floating debris. The hallway lights flicker sporadically. Jack turns his attention towards the closed office door just as Rose enters from the other side.\n\nShe rushes to him, kissing him briefly before rummaging through a cabinet full of keys. Pulling out a desk drawer, she searches desperately while exchanging hopeful smiles with Jack. However, as the bow of the ship begins to sink, Rose finds nothing useful in the drawer. Determined, she shoves a desk chair aside and goes to Jack, kissing him once more before leaving the office.\n\nWading through waist-deep water, Rose navigates the dim corridor and ascends to D deck. She dashes through the hallways, encountering a mustached man who quickly retreats. Pausing in an empty corridor, Rose catches her breath as the lights flicker off. She jumps back as a dark-haired steward suddenly appears, pulling her towards him. Quickly, she lands a punch squarely on his nose, sending him reeling backwards before he scurries away.\n\nUndeterred, Rose grabs a fire hose and smashes open an axe case. With axe in hand, she heads for the E deck stairs. Above, Captain Smith surveils the flooding decks from the bridge. Rose descends the stairs, now partially submerged, and steps into the flooded hallway. She discards her sweater and, using a pipe along the ceiling, propels herself through the chest-deep water through the corridor to the office.\n\nWith the axe held high, Rose re-enters the office where Jack stretches the handcuff chain taut against the pipe. She lifts the axe and, turning to a wooden cabinet, forcefully swings it against the door.",

Concurrently, Ismay stands beside the collapsible lifeboat, stealing a glance at the crowd of passengers on the lower side of the bridge before turning back. Seizing the moment when Murdoch's back is turned, Ismay slips into a seat on the collapsible. Murdoch, turning to face the lifeboat, finds his mate already seated, staring straight ahead. With a stern glower, Murdoch signals with both arms for the seamen to lower the collapsible. As it descends, Ismay looks up briefly before disappearing below the deck.\n\nMeanwhile, Lightoller secures a young girl in another lifeboat. Rose, turning to Jack, catches Cal's watchful eye. In a brusque manner, Cal removes the blanket from Rose and thrusts it at Jack, then drapes his own coat around her shoulders. Attempting to caress her hair, Cal is rebuffed as Rose pulls away. Jack promptly steps closer to her. A crewman then guides Rose toward the lifeboat, with Jack and another crew member assisting her aboard. Despite her grasp on Jack's hand, the crewman pushes him back, and the lifeboat begins its descent.\n\nCal and Jack watch Rose intently as the lifeboat lowers. Rose’s gaze shifts between Jack, the descending ropes, and the young girl waving to her father while her sister cries. On deck, a crew member barks orders, arms outstretched. Above, a flare shoots into the dark sky, momentarily lighting up Rose's face before more flares streak across. Abruptly, Rose moves to the lifeboat's edge and leaps, clinging to the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members swiftly pull her back on board.\n\nRose dashes along the lower deck while Jack sprints through the main deck, navigating past passengers and crew. Jack rushes inside and down the grand staircase, where Rose falls into his arms. They embrace passionately, kissing and holding each other. Watching from an upper landing, Cal and Lovejoy move away, Lovejoy guiding Cal before Cal seizes Lovejoy’s gun and rushes down the stairs. Pulling Rose away, Jack and Rose make a hasty escape, with Cal in hot pursuit.",

Crew members are seen hoisting a lifeboat onto makeshift oar ramps.\n\nMurdoch, reaching the deck, dashes to a stairwell, his eyes fixed on the churning water below. Cal rushes through a doorway only to be knocked into a frantic crowd by another man. Caught in the flow, Cal runs with them briefly before climbing a platform to scan the scene. Spotting a crying young girl, he momentarily pauses before moving on.\n\nInside the opulent vessel, Rose and Jack dash up a staircase, witnessing chaotic scenes—a man plummets into the water while another desperately clings to a rope. Cal approaches this chaos just as Murdoch hurls a wad of cash at him, followed by a forceful shove. A man lunges toward a lifeboat, prompting Murdoch to fire a shot. Tragically, Tommy is pushed forward and meets the same fate. Fabrizio kneels beside his fallen friend amidst the turmoil. Overwhelmed, Murdoch retreats to the edge of the ship, his gaze sweeping across the desperate crowd. He then salutes, places the gun to his head, and pulls the trigger, plummeting into the ocean.\n\nCal, after a shocked pause, rushes back to the crowd. Elsewhere, crew members are lowering another lifeboat onto the deck. Cal rescues a crying girl, handing her to a woman before climbing into the lifeboat himself. The woman, perhaps in a final act of trust, returns the girl to Cal as he settles in.\n\nConcurrently, Jack and Rose dash towards the smoking room, where Andrews stands by the fireplace, lost in thought before a painting. He gifts Rose his lifebelt, receiving a heartfelt hug in return. With a final nod from Jack, they hurry through a revolving door. A steward, clutching life belts, rushes towards the Grand Staircase, while outside, a sailor operates a winch, helping to ready another lifeboat.\n\nCaptain Smith watches the chaotic scene unfold, turning as a man wades through the rising water on deck. A woman with a baby approaches him, but the captain, after a moment's stare, steps away. Another man with a lifebelt approaches, but the captain barely acknowledges him before retreating to the wheelhouse, shutting the door behind him. The string quartet finishes their poignant melody, with three members departing as people hurry past. Hartley, the violinist, resumes playing, a haunting serenade to the unfolding tragedy.",

The escalating flood sweeps some up the staircase, while others remain pinned beneath the rising waterline. An elaborate wall clock atop the stairs is swallowed by the churning sea, as more passengers are forced back into the deluged vessel.\n\nOutside, Fabrizio, clad in a life vest, navigates the treacherous waters. He narrowly avoids being crushed against the ship's side by suction from a broken window, bracing himself against the window frame. Despite his attempt to grasp a railing, he slips and decides to swim for open water. Meanwhile, Rose descends to a lower deck, aided by the ship's baker, and ultimately reunites with Jack amidst the chaos.\n\nIn one lifeboat, Cal callously beats back desperate passengers with an oar. Suddenly, cables securing a massive funnel snap, lashing the water like whips. Panic ensues as the colossal funnel teeters and crushes Fabrizio and others swimming nearby. A colossal wave generated by the funnel's impact engulfs several more people. In Cal's lifeboat, a man attempts to climb aboard but is cruelly cast back into the ocean.\n\nJack and Rose, together, forge through the crowd towards another staircase. Inside, survivors cling to the grand staircase columns, as water gushes down an adjacent corridor, smashing furniture and ripping doors from their frames. Behind the Titanic, occupants of another lifeboat frantically row to avoid the colossal propellers emerging from the water.\n\nPassengers now leap from the stern, looming high above the ocean surface. Jack, gripping Rose's hand, pushes through the throng, and they witness others plummeting overboard. Navigating past a group huddled around a priest, they encounter a few dozen people struggling in the water near the propellers. Jack hauls himself and Rose towards the steeply angled deck, clutching the railing where they first encountered each other.\n\nWater cascades down the ever-tilting propellers, as nearby, a woman clutches a young boy. Shivering, Rose clings to Jack, her breath misting in the icy air. She manages a smile, which Jack answers with a tight embrace and a kiss to her forehead—a tender moment amidst the turmoil. Inside the flooded ship, a woman's lifeless body drift beneath a submerged chandelier, her dress billowing eerily in the water.",
    "730": "In the midst of the icy night, Jack takes Rose's hand, his hair glistening with ice crystals. He tenderly kisses the back of her hand, smiles, and then grimaces, closing his eyes. Rose leans her head against their entwined hands, her eyes shut tight.\n\nMeanwhile, a lifeboat returns to the wreckage site. A dark-haired crewman scans the debris-filled water with his flashlight, revealing frozen bodies amidst furniture, barrels, and other wreckage. He uses an oar to prod the stiff corpses, while another sailor clears their path with grim determination. The flashlight beam falls upon a lifeless woman and infant, a stark reminder of the tragedy.\n\nElsewhere, Rose lies on her back on a floating wooden panel, her hair and eyebrows caked with ice. Jack floats beside her, his head and arms barely above water. Rose sings softly to herself, gazing at the starry sky. A distant light illuminates her face as the lifeboat passes nearby. She shakes Jack's hand, smiles, and rubs his arm before sitting up. However, Jack remains motionless, his eyes closed. A dead crewman floats between them, a whistle still in his mouth.\n\nRose's smile fades as she realizes Jack's condition. She shakes him harder, tears welling up in her eyes. A tear trickles down her nose as she chokes back sobs, stroking his hand. The lifeboat rows further away, leaving Rose trembling as she watches it disappear. She lays her head down, closing her eyes briefly.\n\nSuddenly, Rose's eyes open wide. She sits up, pries her hand out of Jack's grip, and kisses it before releasing him. Jack sinks into the icy water, vanishing into the darkness. Rose slides off the platform into the water, swimming towards the frozen crewman to retrieve the whistle. She blows into it desperately as the rescuers' lights shine on her.\n\nAboard the research ship, an older Rose opens her eyes, tears streaming down Lizzy's face. As dawn breaks over the ocean, Ismay sits silently in a lifeboat filled with other survivors. In another boat, a man takes a drink from a flask and passes it to Cal. Elsewhere, Ruth huddles against Molly, who steers the boat with a blank expression. Wrapped in a blanket, Ruth looks up, her face pale and dazed in the green light.",
    "733": "In a burst of joy and chaos, Jack smacks a kiss on his hard-won tickets and embraces Fabrizio, while nearby Olaf throttles Sven. Fabrizio swiftly gathers their winnings into Jack's cap, and the pair dash off, running along the dock and up the gangplank of a mighty ship. With sacks slung over their shoulders, they sprint onto one of the upper decks, waving to well-wishers from the railing as they go. The Titanic groans to life, black smoke billowing from one of its four stacks, as hundreds of passengers wave farewell to those on the dock. Below, a bearded man cranks a movie camera, turning up clouds of silt as the vessel begins its journey. The Titanic slides past a tiny two-manned sailboat, its massive crowd making white seagulls seem no larger than insects as they flutter by the ship's four rows of portholes.\n\nWithin the ocean liner's labyrinthine corridors, a brown-haired woman guides a young boy and girl up a passageway, crossing paths with Jack and Fabrizio. Jack enters his cramped berth, his new roommates casting puzzled glances at one another. Meanwhile, in the opulence of her cabin, Rose carefully unpacks a painting. A porter hauls in a pair of suitcases as Cal enters from the adjoining promenade deck, a second porter wheeling in a safe on a dolly as Cal wedges a bottle of champagne into an ice bucket.\n\nThe Titanic cleaves the open water, the white-bearded Captain Smith joining the first officer on deck. Murdoch strides into the wheelhouse, and far below, Moody tugs a telegraph lever to 'full ahead' in the engine room, setting off a symphony of moving parts. Men dash along catwalks, turning gears driving huge pistons up and down, while in the smoky boiler room, a mustached foreman turns a wheel connected to several steam engines, the furnaces ravenous for coal. A needle on a steam pressure gauge rises steadily, the pistons churning ever faster, propelling the Titanic through the ocean waves.\n\nOn deck, Jack and Fabrizio lean against the railing, their grins widening as they spot dolphins swimming and leaping alongside the ship. Behind them, Captain Smith stands on the uppermost deck, a crew member handing him a steaming cup of tea. He sips his drink, gazing out at the sea and the joyous dance of dolphins skimming through the clear water like torpedoes. Far below, the ship's relentless heart beats on, stokers shoveling endless piles of coal into the furnaces, massive pistons pumping, and an engineer overseeing it all from his perch above.",
    "734": "At the bow of the ship, Jack grips a cable and climbs onto the railing, stretching his arms wide and tilting his head back, eyes closed, as the vast ship slices through the ocean. Meanwhile, Rose has lunch with her mother Ruth, her fiancé Cal, and several guests, including Molly Brown and a mustached man. Defiantly, Rose lights a cigarette, blowing the smoke towards her disapproving mother. Cal quickly stubs it out, and Rose, smiling, excuses herself from the table.\n\nElsewhere, a young brunette girl stands on a railing, her father supporting her from behind, as Jack, sitting nearby, sketches them with a charcoal stick. Crew members walk dogs on leashes, and a brown-haired Irishman approaches Jack, offering his hand. Jack takes it in, gazing across the ship, his attention drawn to Rose, who has stepped onto an upper deck railing behind Tommy. Tommy grins at Jack, and Jack stares up at Rose, who steals glances at him before looking away, only to peek back from the corner of her eyes. Fabrizio waves a hand in front of Jack's face, snapping him back to reality.\n\nCal appears, grabbing Rose's arm, and they exchange words. Rose storms off, and Cal rolls his eyes, following her. Later, Rose, in a ruby-colored evening gown, pushes past passengers, rushing down a deck and through a gate to the lower rear deck. Jack, lying on a bench and smoking a cigarette under the stars, sees her pass and sits up. Rose, tears streaming, runs to the poop deck and looks back before gazing down at the churning waters. She climbs onto the railing, swings her legs over, and lowers herself onto the gun wheel, facing the ocean, her auburn curls whipping in the wind.\n\nJack approaches quietly, tossing his cigarette off the ship. He turns to Rose, taking off his coat, boots, and vest. He reaches out his hand, and Rose takes it, turning to face him, her feet slipping slightly on the narrow ledge. Jack smiles at her, a reassuring gesture in the chaos of emotions.",
    "741": "In the quiet of her mind, she envisions Constantine sitting on the front steps, carefully braiding young Skeeter's hair. A warm smile plays on her lips as she reminisces. Meanwhile, on a drizzly street corner, Miss Stein arranges two stacks of slim hardbacks with pale blue covers in a bookshop window. Minnie, in the midst of frying chicken, pauses to open an envelope filled with money. She tucks it into her dress and rushes out, leaving the chicken to char.\n\nAt a retirement home, Mrs. Walters reads aloud from the book to a group of residents, turning the pages with a casual smile. Later, she's heard chatting on the phone with her daughter. Elsewhere, Aibileen and Minnie navigate a supermarket, pushing their trolleys. Aibileen steps aside to let a white lady pass, but as they reach the end of an aisle, both women freeze. They spot a formidable woman absorbed in something, steeling themselves to walk past her.\n\nBack at Skeeter's house, Stuart storms out onto the porch, his face dark with anger. He pivots and marches towards his Jeep, leaving Skeeter confused and teary. Meanwhile, copies of the book are circulating. Charlotte, sitting up in bed next to her sleeping husband, reads it with growing horror, eventually sinking into her pillow and removing her glasses in disbelief. Elizabeth, feeding her baby in a rocking chair, is engrossed in the pages. Even Yule Mae reads it aloud to her fellow prison inmates, while Hilly pores over it in bed.\n\nLater, Hilly sifts through her mail, finding a note from Celia Foote enclosing a check. She smirks, tears the check to shreds, and storms out of the house. Barreling down a dirt road, she swigs beer, swerving the car as she tosses the empty bottle into the backseat. Skeeter, meanwhile, receives a life-changing letter from Elaine Stein, offering her a job as a junior editor at Harper & Row Publishers.\n\nHilly, enraged, arrives at Skeeter's house in a cloud of dust. She hurls a pebble at Skeeter, her lips marred by a cold sore. Charlotte, elegant in a turban, greets Hilly with a lofty smile, struggling with Skeeter to keep a straight face. Charlotte grasps Skeeter's hand as they enter the spacious, parquet-floored hall, suddenly looking very tired.",
    "739": "**Movie Description:**\n\nUnder a crescent moon reflected in still water, a tranquil scene is set, with a boy fishing from the moon's curvature and a fisherman's float bobbing on the surface. A somber black woman in her 40s, later revealed to be Aibileen Clark, turns to the camera, leaving aside her cooking pot. She nods smiling, her gaze deep and penetrating, but her smile quickly fades as she glances at a photo of a young black graduate, then tenderly lifts a baby girl from her cot, wrapping her in a warm embrace. Donning a wig and pale blue-and-white uniform, she heads to the bus stop, soothing the child with a gentle pat, her uneven hem swaying with each step.\n\nMeanwhile, a spirited young redhead, Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, speeds down a dusty rural track in a blue 1962 Cadillac convertible, determination etched on her face. She pulls into a gas station, waiting as an attendant cleans her windscreen, then drives towards the imposing offices of the Jackson Journal. With confident strides, she enters the bustling office and is led to the editor's desk, where she hands over her resume. She emerges from his office beaming, clutching a basket of readers' letters.\n\nAt a nearby home, a prim brunette in a flowery '60s dress marks toilet paper with dots, while stout Minnie, the maid, shouts up the stairs, then follows the ladies out, carrying a pie. Aibileen, narrating, garnishes a dish with grapes, sliding it over a cracked dining table under Elizabeth Leefolt's watchful eye. She then tends to moon-faced Mae Mobley in the bathroom, before Elizabeth collects her daughter. Hilly, a sociable woman, enters the sitting room, beaming at her girlfriends. Minnie joins Aibileen in the kitchen, helping herself to a deviled egg before lugging a TV set and tray towards the lounge, with Aibileen trailing behind, holding the cord.\n\nThe story of these intertwined lives in Jackson, Mississippi, unfolds against the backdrop of the burgeoning civil rights movement, each scene a snapshot of their experiences, struggles, and triumphs.",
    "747": "In the quiet of morning, Aibileen prepares breakfast while Minnie enjoys a cup of tea. Suddenly, Skeeter's eyes sparkle with excitement. Meanwhile, at her home, Charlotte calls upstairs, her voice echoing through the house. Skeeter, still in her pajamas, rushes out of her room, her enthusiasm barely containing her from slipping on the stairs. She swiftly opens the kitchen's fly screen door, her eyes scanning the room eagerly, her hair still in rollers from the night before. She pauses, touching her smooth hair, then dashes off in a pickup truck loaded with a trailer, watched by Charlotte. Skeeter speeds across a bridge, heading towards a leafy suburb.\n\nAt the Holbrooks' residence, Hilly checks her watch impatiently. Skeeter arrives, her appearance disheveled from the rush. William and Stuart stand to greet her, playfully swigging their Cokes. Later, at dinner, Stuart, dressed in a clean-cut suit, downs his bourbon and imperiously signals a waiter. He wears a confused expression, which deepens as Hilly ushers her husband away, leaving Skeeter alone with Stuart. He lets out a burp, earning an eye roll from Skeeter who then leaves the table, stomping off as Stuart chuckles, amused. He winks drunkenly at William, who shakes his head in dismay.\n\nMeanwhile, in her yard, Celia brings a flapping chicken to a log, ax ready. Minnie watches from a window, wincing at the sight. A tin of Crisco lard sits nearby as Celia smiles warmly, taking a brown paper bag from Minnie. Later, Minnie sits at a nicely laid table by the kitchen window, placing a napkin on her lap as she lifts a fried chicken wing to her lips. She pauses, staring at Celia's resolute expression, then sits back down. Celia bites into a chicken leg, smiling contentedly, earning a look from Minnie.\n\nLater, Minnie and Aibileen huddle together in Aibileen's dimly lit house, listening intently to a phone conversation. Aibileen's face crumples in pain at the memories, and she leaves the room, brushing Minnie's hand away.\n\nBy the Holbrook swimming pool, Hilly addresses a group of local ladies, Elizabeth simpering nearby. Elain notices a pamphlet sticking out of Skeeter's briefcase, dramatically shielding her eyes from the sun as she awaits Aibileen's response. Aibileen looks across at Yule Mae, their eyes meeting briefly. Later, Skeeter wanders into the Holbrook's kitchen, finding Yule Mae by the sink. Yule Mae checks that they are alone before Hilly enters, carrying her little boy, Billy. Hilly kisses Billy's head before handing him over to Yule Mae, her face hardening as she points a threatening finger.\n\nAs night falls, Skeeter works in her room, cigarette in hand, as she pores over Hilly's text. She looks up at a shelf, her gaze fixing bitterly on a photograph of her and Hilly from their younger days.",
    "748": "In the opening scene, a woman defiantly stubs out her cigarette and removes a guilt-framed black and white photo from its place, concealing it within a drawer. The following morning finds her asleep and fully clothed on her bed when Charlotte, dressed in a skull cap and gown, bursts into the room and begins rummaging through the wardrobe.\n\nLater, a elegantly attired Charlotte attempts to eavesdrop on a conversation between Stuart and Skeeter while tending to her plants on the porch. Stuart starts to walk away, and Skeeter, glancing back at the house, frowns thoughtfully. In a diner, Stuart, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, orders oysters as they share a moment, clinking an oyster shell and a cracker together. He reaches across the table, taking her hand, and she responds with a warm smile. Outside the diner, Stuart grabs her hand, steps closer, and kisses her tenderly.\n\nMeanwhile, Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's knee, engrossed in a picture book. Hilly emerges from her house, grimacing, and pushes past a press photographer. Toilets are scattered haphazardly across her yard. She cradles her \"Yard of the Month\" sign, carrying it inside under the amused gazes of onlookers. Mae Mobley, with her knickers down, sits proudly on one of the toilets, only to be dragged away by Elizabeth. Aibileen tenderly sets Mae Mobley down on the lawn, kneeling in front of her. Taking the child's hands, she looks deeply into her moon-shaped face before they hug tightly. Elizabeth watches coldly from the front door before retreating inside.\n\nAt the Phelan residence, Skeeter, Josefo, and Pascagoula are engrossed in a TV broadcast featuring civil rights activist Medgar Evers. Charlotte abruptly turns off the TV, prompting the servants to scoot away. Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand, but Skeeter pulls away and leaves.\n\nOn her way home, Aibileen is napping on the bus when Henry, sitting nearby, looks up from his book. The bus stops, the driver turns on the interior lights, and Aibileen and Henry hurriedly disembark, walking down the dark street. Henry disappears around the corner, and Aibileen starts to run, eventually tripping and falling.\n\nBack at Minnie's home, her children exit the kitchen, with the three younger ones piling into a single bed. The two friends embrace, putting their arms around each other. Skeeter, with a somber expression, flips back to the front cover of LIFE magazine, revealing a distraught widow comforting her young son.\n\nAt the Foote mansion, Minnie meticulously vacuums a stuffed grizzly bear standing on a corner dice display. She then steps down from the platform, making her way through the spacious rooms and entering the bedroom, heading straight for the bathroom door.",
    "749": "In a slow, deliberate manner, she steps away from the door. Suddenly, she bursts through the bathroom door to discover Celia seated in a pool of blood. With haste, Minnie grabs the fallen towel rack and swiftly assesses the situation with a calm demeanor. She gently covers Celia, now lying in bed, with a counterpane. Minnie tends to Celia, pressing a wet cloth against her neck, but Minnie's initially encouraging expression begins to fade. Celia, lying in bed, can't hold back her tears, her face contorting in a painful grimace.\n\nLater, outside in her garden, Celia is seen digging a hole in the lawn. She places a small square cardboard box into the hole and begins filling it with earth. Before her stand two rose bushes, each nestled in its own brick-lined flower bed. As the hole is nearly filled, she reaches for a third rose bush, placing it into the hole.\n\nMeanwhile, on the street, the doors of a yellow and green bus swing open, and a stream of maids descend. The last to emerge are Yule Mae and Aibileen. In a abrupt turn, a police officer handcuffs Yule Mae. Aibileen is shoved back against the bus as Yule Mae is forcefully led away. Yule Mae's face is pressed onto the hood of a police car, with one of the officers issuing a stern warning. Aibileen witnesses white mothers and their children being turned away with cold indifference. Nearby, Hilly sits in her car with her son, her expression unreadable.\n\nSkeeter, seated at the counter in the diner, watches as Hilly enters. Hilly settles her son in one of the booths. Behind the counter, Henry leans in towards Skeeter, his wise, dark eyes gazing at her through his distinctive owl-like glasses. Skeeter rushes over to Aibileen, finding the living room filled with maids, their somber, smooth-skinned faces turning towards her. Aibileen gestures to her, and with tears welling up in her eyes, she steps into the center of the room. A white-haired woman begins to share her story.\n\nMiss Tine, enjoying lunch with two male colleagues in an upscale restaurant, takes a call from Skeeter. An orange cruiser pulls into Elizabeth’s driveway, where a bridge game is in full swing. Mary Beth takes Skeeter's place at Hilly's table. Dressed in a low-cut fitted plum top and a tight pink skirt, Celia saunters up the garden path carrying a pie. Elizabeth casts a glance towards the door, causing Hilly's jaw to drop. Seizing control, Hilly swiftly ducks out of sight.\n\nAt the front of the house, Celia notices a gap in the curtains and flashes a cheerful smile. Hilly sees her but Celia’s friendly smile fades as she realizes the cold reception. She retreats, taking her pie with her. Aibileen observes Celia’s humiliation from the kitchen doorway. As Celia makes her way to her car, she struggles to hold back her tears. Back home, Minnie looks at her with a motherly concern, as if comforting a small child who's just been bullied.",
    "750": "In the quiet comfort of a home, Minnie, bearing a cut above her eye, sighs and takes a seat on a chair prepared for her by Celia. With gentle care, Celia tends to the wound, dabbing it with a cloth. Minnie, silent and attentive, absorbs Celia's words of advice.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Phelan residence, a solemn atmosphere prevails. The family is gathered around a black and white television, absorbed in Walter Cronkite's broadcast. Stuart, dressed in black, tenderly kisses Skeeter on the forehead. She turns back to the screen, her eyes filled with tears, as a color photograph of John F. Kennedy is now displayed alongside a picture of Aibileen’s son.\n\nMinnie's gaze shifts, and her mind drifts back to a previous encounter at Hilly’s house. In a polished mahogany dining room, Hilly luxuriates in the deliciousness of Minnie's pie, taking forkful after forkful. Minnie watches with a satisfied, almost amused expression. Then, Mrs. Walters storms in, pours herself a whiskey, and shoves the plate back at Minnie, dismissing her while taking another bite. Minnie slams the plate down, and as Hilly takes the final bite, Minnie stands up, her round black eyes fixed on the pie and then on Hilly. As Mrs. Walters giggles in the background, Hilly wretches in discomfort. Minnie picks up the remaining pie and flees, shaking her head before storming out.\n\nThe scene shifts to a grand setting, where a white-only Jackson City cab delivers Mrs. Walters to the Junior League benefit dinner. She joins other elegantly dressed guests ascending the fairy-lit steps. Inside, the Footes, arm in arm, grab champagne glasses from a waiter’s tray. In the background, Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are diligently working, dressed in uniforms with white collars and aprons. Minnie nudges Aibileen, pointing out Celia’s striking pink dress. Polishing off her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, who freezes with an automatic smile, then slaps her husband for glancing at Celia.\n\nOn the black and white checkered dance floor, Charlotte and her husband sway, alongside Skeeter and Stuart, dancing cheek to cheek. Celia stands by the buffet table with another glass of champagne, scribbling something down. The merriment is heightened as Mr. Blackly performs a lively jig and a cartwheel, making the maids laugh heartily.\n\nIn the powder room, Celia leans forward to reapply her lipstick, unknowingly turning her perfectly formed behind in the direction of Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth, who stand in a hostile line by the mantlepiece. Back in the ballroom, Hilly holds out her hand towards the line of staff members, prompting Skeeter’s face to tighten with tension.\n\nThe narrative interweaves the personal and public, blending the quiet moments of Minnie’s care and the shared grief at the Phelan’s, with the vibrant social scene at the Junior League benefit, all laced with the underlying tensions of Minnie’s flashback and the relationships between the characters.",
    "752": "In the heart of a dimly lit warehouse, a tall, caped figure makes a dramatic entrance as a towering door swings open. The figure pauses, surveying the eerie landscape illuminated by the silver-grey light filtering through small windows. The glow reveals a collection of unusual objects and, tucked beyond a set of stairs, the mangled ends of two train carriages. The man approaches the closer of the two, its rear relatively intact, but its sides brutally gutted, with cracked, shattered glass and seats torn from their mountings, their upholstery scorched. Bathed in the faint light, the man's expression darkens as he gazes upon the wreckage, ignoring the water dripping from his hood.\n\nMeanwhile, amidst the gloom, a young man, David, roughly 20 years old, begins to stir from his crouched position. He rises to his knees, his face illuminated by an nearby inferno—a car ablaze, flipped onto its roof. Within the burning wreck, a young woman, Audrey, lies motionless. David, with a surge of adrenaline, lurches towards the car, crawling and stumbling. He grapples with the door, checking the latch, but it's jammed. With Audrey's arm dangling lifelessly from the window, David summons his strength and wrenches the door from its hinges. Flames dance wildly into the night as he bends down, releases Audrey's seat belt, and carefully drags her away from the fiery wreck.\n\nCrushing her gently against the cool earth, David looks over his shoulder to see a pickup truck rounding the bend. He waves desperately, drawing the driver's attention. When he turns back, Audrey's eyes flutter open. Cradling her head, he gazes tenderly at her, then looks up at the approaching truck driver. Behind him, the flames continue to flicker, casting a thoughtful shadow over David's face as he avoids the driver's concerned gaze.\n\nElsewhere, Elijah navigates a dark corridor in his wheelchair, his right leg stiffly outstretched, supported by a metal frame punctuated by two rows of shiny bolts. Picking up a phone, he looks ahead, past the sprawling shelves of an immense comic collection. Above the bustling concourse of Philadelphia Train Station, David stands at the top of the stairs. He is flanked by tall, classical stone pillars, a silent sentinel to the scene unfolding below.",
    "753": "Beneath the colossal, radiant station clock, the scene unfolds. Under the chilly, silver beams of overhead lamps, travelers hurry across the concourse. Against the monotonous grey backdrop, David emerges, descending a stone staircase. He pauses at the foot of the stairs, clad in a baseball cap and rain cape, observing the human tide. With a measured pace, he begins to weave through the crowd.\n\nA sudden jolt as a young blonde woman in a vivid red jacket collides with him. His gaze lifts, and from a higher vantage point, he sees the same woman in a gleaming jacket within a jewellery shop. She distracts the elderly assistant, seizes a bracelet, and drops it into her bag. David watches as she melts into the throng. He resumes his slow march, people brushing past, some grazing him.\n\nMid-concourse, David halts, extending his left hand slightly. A man in a check shirt unknowingly brushes against it. From his elevated perspective, David witnesses this man lean out of a pickup truck and viciously assault a black woman on a city street at night. The attacker then drains a beer can, discarding it into a trash bin.\n\nDavid's vision shifts to a young man in a green shirt kneeling beside a bed. A young woman in a scandalously short party dress lies sprawled, unmoving. The boy rises, her leg slips off the bed, revealing more of her unconscious form amidst a pile of coats. The boy departs, shutting the door softly.\n\nBack in the station, David surveys his surroundings. A group of college students, uniformly wearing maroon baseball caps, parade past. Beyond them, the young man, now in a green jacket, embraces his mother, turning to share a smile with his father. David, overwhelmed, begins to retreat, swallowing hard as he glances at the passing crowd. He collides with a maintenance man in orange overalls pushing a wheeled trash bin.\n\nIn a sudden shift, the maintenance man stands at a front door, now wearing an orange T-shirt. The homeowner answers, and the two lock eyes through the screen. The maintenance man grabs the door, forcing it open. David envisions the homeowner sprawled, lifeless, on the basement steps. Shocked, he looks up, then scans the concourse, spotting the maintenance man dumping the trash can on the far side.",
    "754": "In the gloomy shadows of a dimly lit corridor, David trails a man wheeling his trash bin around a corner. A few indifferent individuals lean against the wall, barely noticing the pursuit. David pauses at a door, his gaze fixed on the frosted glass panels revealing silhouettes moving inside. Suddenly, the door swings open, and the maintenance man emerges, now wearing a cap and carrying a bag across his body.\n\nThe man sets off at a steady pace down a dark, car-lined street, ascending a long stairway illuminated by tall, bright lamps. David follows closely, his hood pulled up against the pouring rain. Upon reaching the top, David pauses, watching as the man continues up a gently sloping street flanked by large, set-back houses. The man turns into a detached house, distinguished by a mature tree in the front garden. He hesitates in the porch, scanning the street before retrieving something hidden nearby and slipping into the shadows around the house.\n\nDavid stands in the rain, head bowed, his hood casting a deep shadow that obscures all but a small triangle from his nose to his mouth. As he lifts his gaze toward the house, two strips of light slowly widen, revealing an opening door. The expanding light exposes mail strewn across a tiled floor and clothes scattered further inside. Water drips from David's cape onto his shoes as he stands silhouetted in the doorway, peering into the illuminated house.\n\nBeyond three open doorways, a staircase is visible. David hesitates before stepping back into a dark lobby, scanning the area to his left. He reaches forward to open another door, flicking on a light. The grim sight of the house owner lying head down on the basement steps greets him, a harsh reminder of the maintenance man's violent intrusion.\n\nMoving slowly, David enters the next room, noting its half-paneled walls and a chair positioned at the end of a table, suggesting a dining room. He passes through to a sitting room, where easy chairs sit and a television flickers, momentarily drawing his gaze. Pausing briefly, David then ascends the stairs, his shadow looming larger on the wall with each step.\n\nAt the top, he peers through the crack of a partly open door, his brow furrowing. Pushing the door open wider, he flicks on the light and steps into a child's bedroom, its walls adorned with pop posters. The room is quiet, holding its breath as David stands within, the culmination of his relentless pursuit.",
    "761": "In the quiet of his room, a man opens the door to a walk-in wardrobe, flicking on a lonely light bulb. He reaches up, feeling beneath folded jeans on a high shelf. His fingers find a bundle wrapped in gray cloth, from which the butt of a gun juts out. He carefully retrieves it, placing the cloth on a newspaper and unwrapping a compact, black revolver. He studies it briefly before wrapping it back up and returning it to its hidden spot. His hand returns to the shelf, extracting a worn folder. Opening it, he leafs through yellowed newspaper clippings chronicling American football games. A familiar face stares back at him from one of the stories—a young David, dressed in football gear.\n\nHe continues to sift through the clippings, copies of old stories, sports results, and photos of football matches, the players' identities obscured by helmets and face guards. Suddenly, he pauses at a stark image of an overturned car. His brow furrows as he examines the photo, clearly snapped at night, showing the vehicle lying upside down in a ditch beyond a bend in a tree-lined road, its roof crushed. Startled, he hastily closes the folder, returning it to its concealed location under the jeans. Across the room, his gaze shifts as Audrey appears outside his door. Her expression collapses, hands flying to her mouth before she turns and descends the stairs. He watches her go, then shuts the door.\n\nThe scene shifts to a vast football stadium where David is stationed, walkie-talkie in hand, beneath a white-canopied walkway. He and Elijah, who leans on a walking stick, move alongside the crowd waiting to enter. David brushes past a tall, slim man in a pale camouflage jacket, then looks back, eyes narrowing. Elijah, in a long black leather coat and gloves, also glances back. David halts at the queue's head, conferring with another security guard who begins frisking attendees. Amidst the crowd, a man with thinning hair and a black beard scans the area.\n\nDavid and Elijah observe the queue’s slow progression, Elijah’s tall frame stooped over his stick. The suspect slips out of line at a gap in the metal barriers, walking against the flow of fans with a hand over his mouth. David and Elijah exchange glances, David grinning before turning away, nodding, and lifting his walkie-talkie. He proceeds along a dimly lit corridor while Elijah’s glass walking stick is left behind on his car seat. The man in the camouflage jacket strides past the vehicle. Elijah hobbles around the stadium's arched colonnade, navigating through intermittent pools of light and shadow, but the man swiftly disappears around the building's curve, slipping from sight.",
    "762": "In the grips of anxiety, Elijah scans his surroundings and notices a man descending into the subway across the road from the imposing, dark brick stadium. Impatiently, Elijah darts across the street against the traffic lights, his coat billowing open to reveal a vivid purple lining. In his haste, he nearly breaks into a skip. Gripping the handrail, he pauses at the top of the long, steep staircase, silhouetted against the daylight, watching as the man stride into the tiled station below. With a burst of determination, Elijah rushes down the stairs, using his cane and the rail to maintain balance, but his hurried steps falter. Suddenly, he slips, his cane clattering down the stairs as he tumbles onto his back, head downwards.\n\nFrom his inverted vantage point, Elijah sees the man glance back before nimbly vaulting the ticket barrier. As the man's jacket flips up, Elijah glimpses a silver gun with a black grip tucked into his waistband. With this revelation, Elijah's eyes flicker and close.\n\nMeanwhile, under the warm afternoon sun, a white bus halts on a hill in a suburban street. David, still clad in his security uniform—a green jacket and maroon cap—and carrying a holdall, steps out. Beaming, he turns and walks towards a small, verdant park where boys are engrossed in a game of American football. Joseph breaks away from the group, bounding up some steps to join his father. Together, they walk away, Joseph's hand rested affectionately on David's back.\n\nLater, in the muted light of a basement, David—now dressed in a light grey sweatshirt—is laid out on a narrow bench, exercising with a weights bar. After finishing a set, he sits up, and Joseph, his son, steps forward, his fringe brushing his eyebrows. David looks away as Joseph adjusts the weights on the bar. Settling back onto the bench, David grips the bar, his mouth contorting with exertion as he lifts. His arms tremble, veins standing out on his forehead while he pushes the bar upwards, then lowers it to his chest, repeating the motion with gritted determination. Finally, with a grimace, he reaches full arm extension and lets the bar clatter back onto the supports.",
    "764": "In the heart of a bustling stadium, David stands frozen in the middle of the walkway, his gaze distant and brow furrowed, seemingly oblivious to the throng around him. He turns slowly, his attention drawn away from the crowd, as a young man in a vibrant blue anorak jostles him. Meanwhile, in the restroom, another young man, his shoulders half-draped in a red and blue anorak, scrubs his hands clean. He casts a glance towards the door, confirming he's alone, before retrieving a small package from a waist bin. Tucking it into his pocket, he adjusts his anorak and saunters out.\n\nDavid, in the walkway, observes the man in the blue anorak joining a ticket queue. Approaching him, David's scrutiny prompts the man to turn and face him. David pats down the man's clothes, digging into one of his anorak pockets, but finds nothing. He steps back, and the man regards him with weariness. David nods, and the man turns away, with David watching him go before sighing and walking in the opposite direction. Pulling out his walkie-talkie, David casts a final glance back at the man, who quickly averts his gaze.\n\nLater, David sits opposite a white-haired woman at a table, under the watchful eyes of Joseph. Beside Joseph, a boy has a thermometer in his mouth. David shakes his head repeatedly, his eyes fixed on the woman, while Joseph looks on with pity.\n\nOutside, Joseph and David traverse a playground, crossing over colorful hopscotch markings. Dusk begins to settle as they reach their house. Inside, David is at the kitchen sink when he notices Joseph sitting at the table, David's gun laid out before him. Joseph picks up the gun, holding it with both hands, pointing it at David. But the gun soon rests back on the table, and David swiftly unloads it, as Audrey collapses in distress. David slumps against the wall, the unloaded gun discarded, while Audrey crumples to the floor.\n\nIn a stark contrast, a limited edition gallery sees David staring down at the carpet in a silver-grey room. Outside, street and shop lights glare in the grey evening, as people gather at a busy junction. Nearby, Elijah sits motionless and sullen in his wheelchair within a shop, the walls adorned with individually wrapped comics, their plastic covers reflecting the light.",
    "765": "In the far corner of a shop, a stockkeeper gazes up from his counter, his attention drawn to Elijah. The man, with thick curly hair and clad in black jeans and a black Motorhead T-shirt, secures an item before striding down the aisle towards Elijah, pausing midway. Meanwhile, Joseph is engrossed in play with two toy figures—a caped superhero and a green reptilian villain—while his parents, Audrey and David, watch nearby. David, who had been leaning against the wall, pockets his hands and turns to Audrey.\n\nBack in the shop, the assistant stoops to scrutinize Elijah, his head swaying gently as if anticipating a response. Receiving none, he cautiously maneuvers Elijah's wheelchair down the crowded aisle. Abruptly, Elijah jerks a wheel, sending the chair careening into a display, toppling magazines. The assistant hesitates, hands fluttering, but Elijah remains impassive. Resuming his push, the assistant is again thwarted by Elijah jerking the other wheel. He steps back, hands raised in surrender, before resuming their journey through the racks of comics and toys. Elijah is left by the toppled display, his gloved hand reaching for a comic featuring a powerful hero charging at demonic figures. The assistant, now at the counter on the phone, is offered the comic by Elijah.\n\nLater, David and Audrey sit across from each other at a bar, locked in a silent gaze. A babysitter is present; David pays her, and she departs, shielding herself from the pouring rain with a brown jacket. David runs a hand over his head, while Audrey leans against a pillar, holding his coat. She nods, turns, and leaves. David tosses his coat over the sofa as the green light of an answering machine blinks in the dark. He enters, pressing a button to check messages.\n\nOutside, a car halts before a chain link fence in the pouring rain. The driver, a caped and hooded figure, exits and approaches the fence. After a moment's hesitation, he grasps the links and begins to climb, his silhouette stark against the headlights.",
    "770": "In the throes of a cataclysmic deluge, the once-majestic mountains are engulfed by the relentless ocean. The wave's ferocity demolishes a monastery nestled in the peaks. Against this backdrop, desperate individuals rush to board an ark, a vessel of last hope. Uri, amidst the chaos, is spotted by a vigilant boarding officer as he struggles to save Alec. The officer dashes to assist, but Alec, though hoisted, remains out of reach. With a surge of strength, Uri grips Alec's legs and propels him to safety, only to plummet into the abyss himself. Two officers manage to drag the resistant boy onto the ark.\n\nMeanwhile, the ark's communications officer detects a hydraulic malfunction impeding the gate's closure. Adriane, monitoring the situation, notices Lily and Noah on the screen. Outside, torrential waters obliterate the airfield and surrounding mountains. On the ark's bridge, the crew stands in awe as floodwaters overtake the landscape. A tense countdown ensues, culminating in a massive wave striking the ark. The impact plunges the vessel into darkness, sending the crew sprawling.\n\nPanic surges as water inundates the corridors, knocking people over. The crew scrambles to regain control while Uri's boys and the boarding officers hastily retreat from the advancing water. In the flooded passageway, Nina tends to Tenzen, who is injured. Elsewhere, a door slams shut, separating Lily and Tamara from Caesar. Tamara manages to free the others but becomes trapped herself in the rapidly flooding corridor.\n\nOn the bridge, Anheuser spots a wrecked plane careening through the waves, its impact severing the ark's anchor. The ark heaves upward, cresting mammoth waves that crash over its top. A computer graphic illustrates the collision between two arks, resulting in a dramatic descent that sends crowds tumbling in the hallways. The ark plunges headlong, as debris scatters chaotically in the corridors.\n\nAmidst the turmoil, Adrian and Laura locate Lily. They gather on the bridge, watching a computer simulation of Mount Everest submerging. Down in the geological bay, Jackson, Kate, Noah, and the Tibetans listen intently over the speaker. Jackson, waist-deep in water, walks away from the group. Noah gazes steadfastly at his father, who tenderly kisses both him and Kate before Kate takes the boy away. Jackson turns, takes a deep breath, and submerges. Nina and Tamara, desperate for rescue, scream for help as water levels rise, engulfing them. Jackson, undeterred, swims into the hydraulic chamber, surfacing in a small air pocket. Kate, meanwhile, focuses on treating Tenzen's injuries, their survival hanging in the balance amidst the tumultuous waters.",
    "771": "In the midst of distraction, Noah stealthily swims away. Beneath the surface, Jackson navigates using a torch, his beam illuminating the murky depths. Suddenly, he catches sight of something unusual. Meanwhile, Kate is occupied with tending to Tenzen, but she quickly notices Noah's absence. Locating his jacket, she submerges herself into the water, resurfacing shortly after. The ark, grand and imposing, begins its float towards the majestic Everest.\n\nAdriane switches on a monitor, revealing Jackson's desperate struggle to free Tenzen's power drill within a chamber. Jackson glances up, noticing a beam of light and the figure of Noah in the distance. Resurfacing for a moment, Jackson dives back under, resolute in his task. Kate, standing above, is taken aback, staring into the darkness as Tenzen addresses his family, his head shaking in despair.\n\nThe water level continues to rise, and Nina, looking up, notices a giraffe peering through the ceiling grate. The ark scrapes against the mountain, shaking violently as Jackson works tirelessly to free the drill. Laura and Lily are jolted by the tremors. As they approach the summit, the hydraulic chamber fumes cut off abruptly. Noah joins his father underwater, their torch revealing the drill entangled in the gears. Together, they surface once more.\n\nA thunderous thump reverberates through the ark as it collides with a glacier. Jackson, with renewed vigor, manages to wrench the cable free, setting the gears in motion and closing the gate. Meanwhile, a portion of the mountain crumbles, causing an avalanche of snow to descend as those on the bridge watch in horror. The ark narrowly avoids a catastrophic collision, drifting away from Everest.\n\nNoah emerges from the hydraulics chamber, meeting Kate's relieved gaze. After ducking back under the water, they resurface, joining the group clinging to the pipes in the darkness. A beacon of light appears underwater, marking Jackson's return. Kate and Noah embrace tightly, their relief palpable. On the bridge, the others cheer and hug, Anheuser looking around at the joyous scene. Scotty and Professor West share an emotional embrace.\n\nWith Kate and Noah still in a tight hug, Jackson turns to Nina and Tenzen, receiving a heartening thumbs up. He nods in acknowledgment. The group, still treading water, continues their journey away from the world's highest peak. In his quarters, Adriane diligently works on his laptop while Laura reads a book, their eyes eventually meeting in a warm smile. As they both stand, Adriane approaches Laura, their moment culminating in an intense, shared kiss. Lily spots little Caesar, and Alec Karpov hands the dog to her. Jackson finally approaches Kate, their eyes meeting as the massive door opens, flooding the ark with daylight, with Lily and Noah by her side, and Jackson standing protectively behind her.",
    "775": "**Movie Description:**\n\nUnder the nervous eye of Gordon, the plane's controls await his touch as a menacing fissure draws near. Jackson, taking charge, guides Gordon's hands to the throttle. With a swift pull, Gordon lifts the plane off the ground, escaping the crumbling runway just in time. Wide-eyed Noah watches in shock as a vast canyon yawns beneath them, swallowing buildings whole. Gordon deftly navigates the plane through a labyrinth of falling debris and tumbling freeway sections, rolling sharply to avoid catastrophe. Below, helpless people scatter across the fractured landscape as the plane skims low over the ravaged city center.\n\nGordon battles for altitude, the ground rising swiftly beneath them. Lilly's sobs echo through the cabin, her gaze fixed on the terrified masses and vehicles plummeting into the abyss. The plane dips into the ever-widening chasm, narrowly missing a train that arcs overhead, smashes into a wall, and bursts into flames. Clearing the canyon, they face a new obstacle: twin high-rises collapsing in a V-shape. Gordon, undeterred, pilots the plane through the narrow gap, buildings shattering around them as debris clutters the sky.\n\nAs they emerge from the collapsing cityscape, Jackson watches in awe the devastating chasm splitting the city in two. Below, the devastation unfolds like a grim tableau—explosions bloom in the streets, buildings topple, and the entire state begins its descent into the sea. The Californian coastline slowly succumbs, sliding into the watery depths. Aboard the Genesis, Gordon is handed a much-needed drink, while Harry, on a nearby vessel, receives a somber phone call, his expression grave as he relays the news to Adrian.\n\nMeanwhile, a biplane buzzes over Yellowstone Park, where a doe grazes calmly. Gordon executes a careful landing, prompting Jackson to leap out and inspect a nearby petrol pump. With the RV started, Noah answers his phone, and Lily spots Charlie on a ridge. The group halts near the ridge, their expressions tinged with unease as a massive flock of birds takes flight. Lily joins them, and together they witness the ominous rise of the undulating mountain range, the land lifting and sinking in a terrifying dance. A funnel of steam erupts from a crack in the ground, and Charlie, beaming, watches as they hurry past his motorbike. Stepping onto the runway, Gordon checks his watch, oblivious to the blinding flash engulfing Yellowstone's mountains, leaving Charlie awestruck on the ridge.\n\nAs the action unfolds, the characters aboard the Genesis—Harry, Adrian, Tony, and Kevin—play out their roles in a tense drama, each privy to the escalating crisis from their unique vantage points. The narrative seamlessly intertwines their experiences with the harrowing journey of Gordon, Jackson, Noah, Lilly, and Charlie, culminating in an breathtaking crescendo of disaster and survival.",
    "776": "In the opening moments, Kate and Gordon shield their eyes from a sudden, intense light. Jackson, from the RV's mirror, witnesses a colossal blast. A brillant flash engulfs the sky, followed by an immense wave of energy that decimates the remaining trees and sends Charlie sprawling backwards. A colossal tower of fire and dense black smoke chokes the air. Kate clings to Noah, who stands by her side. Charlie struggles to his feet amidst a barrage of fireballs cascading from the sky, only to be struck down by a massive projectile. Incendiary bombs pummel the park indiscriminately.\n\nJackson navigates the RV through the chaotic landscape, deftly avoiding plummeting rocks before a fireball tears through the back of the vehicle, leaving a gaping, flaming hole. Meanwhile, Noah scans the tarmac from the plane's doorway, his eyes wide with worry, while Kate stands nearby, her expression painted with anxiety. Molten rocks pulverize the research center, and flaming debris batters the surrounding area. A yawning chasm splits the ground between the RV and the runway, but Jackson floors the accelerator, launching the RV over the expanding abyss. With a thud, they land safely on the other side, and Jackson pulls up behind the plane.\n\nKate dashes over as Jackson emerges from the RV, then hurriedly returns to the plane with Lilly. The tarmac begins to fracture as Jackson dives back into the RV, discovering a London tube map inside. A infernal fissure gapes open, swallowing the RV and sending Jackson tumbling down the aisle, where he grabs a handle for dear life. At the plane's controls, Gordon starts the engine, and the plane begins to move. Fireballs crash around them, and a hand grasping a map appears on the fissure's jagged edge. Thick smoke clogs the sky as Jackson sprints along the runway, narrowly escaping disaster when Kate pulls him inside the plane just in time.\n\nWith Gordon at the helm, the plane roars down the runway, pursued by a hellish barrage of fireballs and flying rocks. It clears a hilltop, narrowly outpacing a volcanic eruption, as ominous clouds cast long shadows over the frightened passengers. Finally, the plane bursts through the swirling cloud, escaping the fireballs and soaring into the open sky. Noah flashes a triumphant thumbs up, and Kate turns her attention to Jackson, who catches his breath and unfurls the map—revealing not London, but China. Every pair of eyes on the plane regards him dubiously. From the pilot seat, Gordon casts a glance backwards.\n\nMeanwhile, Adrian rushes into Anheuser's office and trails him into a bustling corridor. In Rio de Janeiro, the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue disintegrates, raining debris onto the streets below. Anheuser and Adrian enter a dimly-lit chapel, but Anheuser's surprise is evident, and he abruptly leaves, with two agents closing the doors and sealing Adrian and Wilson inside, engulfed in darkness.",
    "777": "In the bustling city of Las Vegas, a deep chasm splits the ground, smoke billowing into the sky as buildings burn. At McAllen airport, a light plane descends towards a runway crumbling into the chasm, managing a chaotic landing. Twins Alec and Oleg huddle with Yuri and Tamara near the grounded plane, but the group is disrupted as a mechanic flees and a fireman compels Yuri to move. Meanwhile, a limo pulls up beside Air Force One, and Adrian emerges, boarding the plane. Inside the busy control room filled with computers and terminals, Anheuser ends a call, attempting to read Adrian's expression as he enters. The onboard staff pause their tasks, and Adrian watches forlornly as Anheuser departs.\n\nAir Force One begins to taxi along the runway. Laura, stepping out of the president's cabin, is approached by a steward before retreating back into the cabin to take a phone call. She leans against the wall, sobbing, as a light behind Wilson fades. His secretary, Sally, appears in the doorway, prompting Wilson to end his call. Air Force One takes off, and Wilson addresses the nation from his office as the broadcast fades.\n\nBack at the airport, a fireman's expression turns grim as he closes a glass door, reflecting an approaching ash cloud. Sasha guides Jackson and the others to an Antonov cargo plane filled with gleaming sports cars. As the ash cloud billows across the airport, engulfing the control tower, the Antonov begins to taxi. A tire is lost, and the plane approaches the damaged end of the runway before plummeting into the chasm. Inside, Yuri secures his sons while Tamara reaches for Caesar.\n\nWith two buildings ahead, Gordon skillfully navigates the plane through the narrow space, scraping through and rising again. The control tower shudders as they clear another building, and Gordon gasps as the plane shears off the top of a tall tower with its underside. Onboard, Jackson reassures Noah, and Kate embraces Lilly.\n\nHalfway across the world in Tibet, Nima and Lama Rinpoche sit on a monastery balcony overlooking snow-covered mountains. Lama Rinpoche calmly pours tea until Nema's cup overflows, stopping only when Nema intervenes.

Meanwhile, at her apartment, Jane is engaged in a battle with her evening dresses, attempting to cram them into an already overflowing closet bursting with a vibrant array of party gowns. She forces the doors shut, but they defiantly spring back open.\n\nResigned, Jane grabs some papers and settles onto the couch. Outside, the setting sun casts a warm glow over the city skyline, silhouetting the towering buildings against the lush backdrop of Central Park as rush hour commences. Kevin, coffees in hand, arrives at the bustling offices of the New York Journal.\n\nCrossing a busy street, Jane encounters Casey, who is just stepping out of a cab, proudly wearing a man's white shirt. Together, they enter their office reception, and Jane, grinning, makes her way to her cluttered desk. Kevin shows her a filofax, to which Jane responds with a glare. Later, Jane and Casey are found scrutinizing photo layouts. As Gina walks away, Jane's expression turns exasperated, while Casey pulls a face. Jane watches in dismay as the ruggedly handsome George departs, leaving her to sort through a chaos of adhesive notes after Casey's abrupt exit, who flashes Gina a insincere smile before flouncing off.\n\nA jumbo jet lands, and at the airport, Jane's face lights up as her cute blonde sister Tess arrives. The sisters make their way to Jane's apartment, where Jane struggles with the luggage. Later that night, in one of thousands of taxis crisscrossing the city, Kevin is absorbed in reading Jane's filofax.\n\nJane and Casey find themselves at Gina's party in a crowded, dimly lit club. Across the room, George smoothly makes his way over. Jane, breathless, approaches George, who is casually drinking beer and chatting with friends. At the same time, Tess, radiant in a shimmery dress, approaches from another direction. George notices Tess first, grinning, then sees Jane. As Jane gets closer, her face falls, realizing that George and Tess are drawn to each other. They exchange smiles, leaving Jane to wear a forced smile as George catches her eye.\n\nAs Tess and George leave together, Kevin approaches Jane, who looks stunned. She hands him her drink and abruptly walks out of the club through a side door. Kevin watches, puzzled, as Jane vents her frustration by hitting a wall with her handbag, all in full view of a sedate dinner party nearby. Trying to regain her composure, she returns to the club where Kevin waits, eyebrows raised. She stares pensively after Tess and George.\n\nLater, a car cruises past Jane's building. She rushes to the front door, peeks through the peephole, then flings it open, only to stomp back inside, disappointed. In the living room, she switches on the light, revealing an empty space. Anxiously, she paces back and forth, then picks up a magazine from the couch. Sitting in a chair, she thumbs through it distractedly, her gaze repeatedly darting towards the front door.",
    "785": "A smartly dressed older lady confronts Jane, leaving her puzzled and uncertain about what she heard. After finishing Casey's drink, Jane marches over to Tess and George, staring challengingly at Tess. Defiantly, Jane stuffs an entire sausage roll into her mouth and strides off, leaving Tess looking worried before turning to grin at her. Tess's face then freezes as Jane locks eyes with her and picks up a folder from a nearby table. Meanwhile, Casey looks bored, and Tess smiles at George.\n\nA slideshow of the couple's past begins, showing cute baby pictures, a young George petting a goat, and Tess dangling a cat by its hind legs. George appears in academic robes, while Tess, as a cheerleader, flirts with footballers. Scenes of George volunteering at a soup kitchen and the United Nations contrast with Tess in a bikini at a car wash and vacationing in Europe with two guys. George's charitable work with animals is highlighted, followed by Tess enjoying a plate of ribs. George seems unhappy as photos with his proud parents are displayed, followed by images of Tess in a fight, grimacing at a baby, and being afraid of George's dog.\n\nBehind the now tense couple, Casey stands up. Jane looks miserable as Tess runs up to her. Jane tries to speak but fails, standing awkwardly with tears in her eyes. Casey empathizes with Jane's pain as she rushes out of the restaurant, followed by Kevin, who had been lurking in the background.\n\nOutside, Jane looks at Kevin with wide, tear-filled eyes. He waits for a reaction, turns to leave, but then stops and returns, holding up a PDA phone with a ribbon. He places it in her hand, gives her a lingering look, and walks away. Jane watches him go with a sad half-smile, looking down at the gift and choking back more tears.\n\nBack at her apartment, Jane places her bag and keys on the hall table and idly toys with a flower in one of the many vases scattered around. Meanwhile, Kevin sits at his desk, staring gloomily into space as Maureen approaches. He gives her a rueful smile and sinks back thoughtfully into his chair.\n\nJane visits her father's store, where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane avoids Tess's furious gaze, feeling baffled and dejected. Back at her apartment, Jane brushes her teeth and catches sight of her closet full of dresses. In a burst of emotion, she throws open the closet and starts flinging the dresses out into the hall, eventually stuffing the last one into a black plastic bag.",
    "789": "Marcus and Willie huddle in the back room, a ladder leaning against the wall, leading up to an air vent. Willie snaps a party popper, earning a glare from Marcus. Seizing the moment as the security guard bids farewell to the last shoppers, Marcus ascends the ladder and navigates through the air vent. Once the coast is clear, the guard checks his watch and arms the security system.\n\nMarcus, hidden within the air conditioning duct, oversees the security booth below. He activates a remote control, disabling all security cameras. Quickly, he retraces his path through the duct, then drops down, crashing through a vent and landing on a table of sweaters strategically positioned by Lois to cushion his fall. The table collapses, but Marcus swiftly recovers, darting to the alarm console and deactivating it with mere seconds remaining.\n\nA service elevator opens, revealing Marcus and Willie, the latter hauling a trolley loaded with safe-cracking equipment. They infiltrate an office, where Marcus approaches a formidable safe. Willie is awestruck, unable to take his eyes off the monumental obstacle. He attempts to crack the combination but fails, prompting Marcus to embark on an annual shopping spree, collecting items from Lois's list.\n\nUndeterred, Willie resorts to drilling the safe, but the bit struggles to penetrate. Donning dark goggles, he tries an arc welder, but the safe resists. Back home, Thurmond meticulously sets the dinner table and selects a bottle of wine, while Sue retrieves a sauce bottle from the fridge.\n\nMarcus, meanwhile, encounters a mannequin adorned with a mink stole, but it's tantalizingly out of reach. Spotting another mannequin holding a golf club, he grasps it and attempts to dislodge the stole, ultimately resorting to dismembering the dummy. Willie, having abandoned finesse, wields a sledgehammer against the safe, but it's Marcus who triumphs, securing the stole. Back in the office, Willie presses his ear against the safe, tapping it tentatively as Marcus enters, finding Willie emerging from behind the resilient strongbox.",
    "790": "In the opening moments, a man grins as he gazes at an open safe. His accomplice, Marcus, smiles and nods in agreement. Willie exits the office, leaving Marcus to stuff a sack with stacks of cash from the safe. Meanwhile, Willie approaches a display of elephant plush toys, an array of purple and pink catching his eye. He picks up a purple one, examines it, but ultimately chooses a pink elephant instead. With a soft smile, he turns to leave, but the sharp click of a revolver being cocked stops him cold. Marcus stands there, gun pointed at Willie, with Lois behind him pushing a handcart. Willie shakes his head slowly, disbelieving, as Marcus's expression momentarily softens before he raises the gun again. Willie closes his eyes, bracing himself.\n\nSuddenly, the police storm in. Marcus ducks behind the handcart, exchanging shots with the officers. Willie flees amidst the chaos, still clutching the pink elephant, which loses its head in the crossfire. He dives around a corner, catching his breath, only to be spotted by a cop who fires a shot, narrowly missing Willie but smashing a nearby wall. Willie dashes off, weaving through a nativity scene, toppling statues as he goes.\n\nEventually, Willie bursts out of the store's backdoor and jumps into a BMW, still holding the toy elephant. He speeds off, smashing into a police car and shattering the BMW's back window as a cop returns fire. The pursuit continues, with Willie glancing back at the trailing cruisers. The BMW screeches around a corner onto Thurmond's street, leaving smoke from the tires.\n\nWillie pulls up at Thurmond's house but, unable to open the car door, climbs out the driver's window, still clutching the pink elephant. Neighboring children watch in horror as the police gun down Willie, dressed as Santa, in a barrage of bullets.

    "786": "In the opening sequence, a statuesque woman in Grecian robes holds a torch aloft, its beams casting a glow before the scene fades to black. Snowflakes gently descend from the night sky, dancing past a Christmas tree composed of fairy lights that adorns O'Hara's Pub. Passersby amble down the street, gifts clutched tightly for their loved ones.\n\nInside the pub, a festive atmosphere prevails as groups of friends, families, and colleagues gather to drink and exchange presents. Laughter and cheer fill the air, embodying the Christmas spirit. At the far end of the bar, a solitary figure sits—a disheveled, unshaven man in his late 40s, dressed in a Santa costume, nursing two glasses of hard liquor. Santa cuts a forlorn figure, a cigarette dangling from his lips as he beckons the barman. His gaze lingers sadly on a group toasting merrily.\n\nLater, Santa stumbles unsteadily up a snow-covered back alley, leaning against the wall before succumbing to illness and vomiting. Meanwhile, in a brightly lit shopping mall, a mother and her young children ascend an escalator. At the top, one of the children gazes in awe at the elaborate Santa's grotto. Inside the grotto, an elf hands the mother a photo of her daughter with Santa.\n\nSanta, now at work, still appears seedy but has donned his white beard. An eight-year-old boy approaches and sits on his knee, only to be roughly shoved away. Moments later, Santa wets himself as his little helper approaches. Pulling down his beard, Santa takes a swig from a bottle of grog and inspects his soiled pants. His helper shakes his head in despair.\n\nAs the day winds down, the security guard bids farewell to the last shoppers and activates the alarm system. Santa shuffles off, leaving the guard to key in the code. Up in the grotto, three snowmen sit behind statues of Mary and the baby Jesus. The smallest snowman suddenly springs to life, darting off after ensuring the coast is clear, and inadvertently topples Mary and Jesus.\n\nThe snowman slides down between the escalators as the alarm system counts down. Crashing into a display at the bottom, he continues his chaotic run through the shop, pulling the arm off a mannequin. Using the arm, he reaches up to deactivate the alarm moments before it sounds. Pulling off his head, the snowman reveals Santa’s profusely sweating little helper. Now in regular clothes, the helper opens a back door to find Santa surrounded by a sea of empty beer cans.",
    "791": "In the opening scene, an elf disapprovingly shakes his head as Santa nonchalantly enters a room, clearly unimpressed by his behavior. Santa proceeds to a store's vault, where he uses a heavy drill to bore through the door of a locked safe. Meanwhile, the elf, Sant'a little helper, is on the shop floor, towing a small hand cart and casually helping himself to an expensive handbag and designer shoes from display cabinets, checking each item off a list.\n\nThe elf's eyes then fall on a string of pearls locked in a cabinet. With a swift motion, he grabs a bead rack and smashes the cabinet open, adding the pearls to his loot. Rejoining Santa in the vault, the elf finds Santa peering through the freshly drilled hole. Santa meticulously uses a chisel to widen the opening, and with a final effort, he swings the safe door open, revealing stacks of cash that tumble out onto the floor.\n\nThe duo makes their getaway in a van driven by an oriental woman. As Santa and the elf climb into the back with their stolen goods, the woman hits the accelerator, speeding off and jolting Santa and the elf backwards. Later, in a stark contrast to their criminal endeavors, Santa—who goes by Willie in the off-season—is seen dancing with the elf, Marcus, in a lively bar. Their celebration is brief, as Marcus shoots Willie a dubious look, clearly awaiting an explanation. Willie, considering Marcus's expectant gaze, exchanges a half-hearted smile and a glance at their empty glasses before making a decision.\n\nThe scene shifts to a sun-soaked beach, where beautiful bikini-clad women adorn the sand. Willie, now dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, is behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping lemons and limes. He pours himself a generous vodka, but his relaxing moment is interrupted by an irate barman who punches him and tosses him over the counter. Willie retaliates by throwing a vodka bottle, but his aim is off, and he finds himself fleeing as the barman leaps over the counter in hot pursuit.\n\nLater, Willie sits alone, enjoying the sight of more bikini-clad women playing volleyball, his eyes lingering on their well-toned figures as he sips a beer. The next morning finds Willie asleep in his modest apartment, surrounded by the remnants of last night's indulgences. He groggily reaches for the clock radio, fumbling for the off button before finally ripping it out of its socket, bringing the scene to a close with a touch of humor and pathos.",
    "792": "In the grimy solace of his bedroom, Willie, parched, takes a swig from a half-empty bottle, ignoring the cigarette butt bobbing within. A smashed clock and scattered empties litter the scene, testament to his reckless state.\n\nMeanwhile, a sleek convertible pulls up at a beachside car valeting service. Willie, with a nonchalant gait, approaches as the driver relinquishes the keys to a young valet. Seizing the moment, Willie helps himself to several sets of keys from the valet board, his eyes scanning the lot. He strolls through the parking lot, pressing remotes, cars blinking and unlocking in his wake. Discarding the keys one by one, he pauses at a blue sports convertible, his eyes lighting up with mischief.\n\nClimbing in, Willie rifles through the glove compartment, extracting the tax disk to read the address before replacing it. The engine roars to life, and he speeds away, leaving the valet none the wiser. The stolen car purrs outside a grand mansion, its pillared entranceway an echo of elegance.\n\nInside, Willie ascends a sweeping marble staircase, making his way to a lavish kitchen. He guzzles milk straight from the bottle, returning it to the brimming fridge, before helping himself to a chicken leg. As he wanders, he trails chaos, tossing oil paintings from the walls. A large portrait catches his eye; behind it, a safe hidden within the wall.\n\nPressing his ear to the cold metal, he begins to finesse the combination lock. His gaze falls upon a companion set by the fireplace, from which he seizes a poker, turning on the safe with newfound vigor. His efforts reveal a cache of money, his eyes widening at the sight.\n\nLater, nestled in an exotic club, Willie's attention is not on the dancer before him, but the scratch card in his hand. A scantily-clad waitress brings him a beer, into which he tucks his card, a sly grin playing on his lips. She follows him home, but his focus is on the phone messages he's scrolling through.\n\nDonning festive elf and Santa costumes, Willie and Marcus stride through a shimmering heat haze in a car park. Willie, clutching a beer bottle, takes a long pull, draining it as a cigarette dangles from his mouth.

Stepping onto the balcony, he dials a number on his phone.\n\nMeanwhile, Marwan sits alone in a bustling restaurant. Ferris approaches, but is halted by two bodyguards. Marwan joins Hani, who excuses himself from his alluring companion to walk off with Ferris. Standing face to face, Ferris, visibly on edge, steps closer to Hani, who then walks away. Marwan intervenes, stopping Ferris from drawing his weapon.\n\nLater, at an airfield, a hangar door creaks open. Clutching Aisha's phone, Ferris sprints to a small jet. Hoffman emerges, carrying a shoulder bag. A message flashes on the phone’s screen, revealing a lengthy phone number. Ferris immediately places the call.\n\nSubsequently, Ferris finds himself in a small village as a van pulls up. The driver exits, opens the rear, and Ferris climbs in, concealing himself beneath the back seats. The driver, sporting thick stubble and a cap, plays a tape as he starts the engine. Under the blazing desert sun, the van slows down in a line of traffic. Soldiers, one with an Alsatian and another perched in a tank turret, conduct checks. The driver looks back nervously as his papers are inspected, then drives off into the vast desert, passing nomads with camels. The landscape stretches out, barren and scorched, under the watchful eye of a surveillance camera that reduces the van to a mere speck.\n\nEventually, the van halts, and the driver opens the back, letting sunlight pour in. Ferris emerges, and the driver gestures for him to follow before speeding away. Left alone, Ferris paces the flat, golden expanse of dusty earth, dotted with sparse bushes. Clutching Aisha's phone, he squats and gazes into the clear blue sky, wiping sweat from his face.\n\nOn a surveillance monitor, Hoffman observes Ferris from above. Four SUVs suddenly appear, advancing towards Ferris, who raises his hands in surrender. The team in the surveillance room watches intently as the SUVs encircle Ferris, kicking up a cloud of dust that obscures the scene. Men exit the vehicles and approach Ferris, their intentions veiled by the swirling dust.",
    "802": "In a billowing cloud of dust, vehicles and men are obscured on the screen. Suddenly, a robe is tossed at Ferris's feet, and a black hood is forced over his head. Barefoot, he is roughly hauled into one of the vehicles. The four SUVs then speed off in different directions, emerging from the dust cloud. Hoffman watches intently as the vehicles scatter. One SUV races down a road, eventually stopping in front of a stone building. Armed men swiftly open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is dragged inside.\n\nInside a dark cell, a man shines a torch on Ferris, who is sitting on the floor, his ankles and wrists bound with cable ties. The man lifts Ferris's hood and offers him water, which Ferris drinks eagerly. Soon after, Ferris is secured to a chair, his ankles tied to the legs, and his hands fastened to the table top with cable ties. Armed men stand guard in the gloomy room, illuminated only by a harsh white light. Behind Ferris, a black cloth adorned with a gold disk and Arabic script hangs on the wall.\n\nAl-Saleem enters the room, passing a group of men. One of them sits by a video camera pointed at Ferris. Al-Saleem takes his seat, and the hood is pulled off Ferris's head. They stare at each other before Al-Saleem waves his finger and orders the cameraman to start filming. Ferris notices Karami among the observers, recalling Hani embracing Karami in the desert.\n\nAl-Saleem stands and picks up a hammer from a table of tools. He strikes Ferris's little finger, snapping it and drawing blood. Ferris defiantly spits in Al-Saleem's face, who wipes it away before hammering another finger. Dropping the hammer, Al-Saleem walks out, leaving Ferris surrounded by men as he hangs his head.\n\nAs Al-Saleem walks away through the dim corridors, wiping his hands on a cloth, an executioner in a black cloak and hat grab Ferris's hair and yanks his head up. He spits in Ferris' face and slams his head down on the table. Meanwhile, Al-Saleem and one of his men descend downstairs and traverse a market.\n\nBloody and battered, Ferris struggles within his ties, heaving and shifting. His restraints are cut, and he is pulled to the floor, kicking and fighting as the men lift him onto the table, face down. The camera continues to film as Ferris is flipped onto his back, held spread-eagled by the men, despite his relentless struggle.",

    "807": "In a choreographed dance of vehicles, cars encircle and halt around two figures, kicking up a dense cloud of dust. From these vehicles emerge Marwan, Hani, and their entourage. Hani signals, and Marwan swiftly opens the door for Ferris to exit. Ferris watches intently as Hani approaches a kneeling figure, removing its hood before dialing a cell phone and handing it over. The figure, revealed to be Karami, ends the call and returns the phone to Hani. A tense stare is exchanged before Karami rises, and the two share a cheek kiss—a customary greeting. One of Hani's men provides Karami with a bicycle, and he pedals away.\n\nHani then saunters over to Ferris, who nods pensively. Later, Ferris is seen walking back to his apartment, engaged in a phone conversation. Upon arrival, he notices an unexpected presence inside. Meanwhile, two SUVs roll through secure gates, parking in front of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate. Ferris and Hoffman emerge, navigating a labyrinth of corridors to convene with Hani in a meeting room. Hoffman, with a forced smile, takes a seat and places a photograph on the table, his gaze fixed on Hani, who briefly looks at Ferris.\n\nThe scene shifts to Hoffman indulging in a fat cigar and a drink with Ferris on his apartment balcony, while children kick a football around in front of a safe house nearby. Elsewhere, Skip is stationed in a bustling market when Karami, distinctively dressed, steps out from a doorway. Skip, spotting him, murmurs into an earpiece and tails Karami as he weaves through the market and down narrow streets. Donning shades, Karami uses a newspaper as a prop, periodically checking on his pursuer. Skip, thwarted by a reversing van, loses precious moments as Karami slips away through a gap between the van and a building. Despite Skip's frantic pursuit, Karami vanishes.\n\nThe narrative then finds Ferris in a health clinic's treatment room, where Nurse Aisha administers an injection to his stomach before exiting. He follows her out, and they traverse a dense landscape of concrete buildings and bustling street markets filled with traders and shoppers. During their walk, they are covertly photographed. Later, Ferris sits in a clinic waiting room surrounded by women and children, some of whom cast curious glances and smiles his way. Aisha, emerging from her room, shares a warm smile with Ferris.",
    "808": "**Movie Description**\n\nThe film opens with a couple, Aisha and Ferris, seated at a cafe, unaware of the men watching them. They share a smile, briefly disrupted by the stern gaze of an old man. A waiter delivers tea, as Aisha casts an anxious glance at Ferris before looking down. Ferris leans in, coaxing a slight smile from her. They depart, only to be intercepted by Marwan, an imposing figure in a dark suit. Ferris recoils, and Aisha watches in concern as Marwan forces Ferris into an SUV. Two SUVs, one carrying Ferris and the other in pursuit, speed away, leaving Aisha behind.\n\nFerris is driven past a bustling market square, his brow furrowed in worry. Simultaneously, a safe house is engulfed in golden flames, drawing a crowd of onlookers. The SUV turns down a dark street, stopping near the burning building. Firefighters battle the blaze as Marwan and Ferris exit the vehicle. Ferris steps closer to the inferno, hand shielding his eyes. He crouches briefly, then straightens, turning to Marwan who gestures back to the SUV.\n\nThe convoy regroups at a desolate area, parking amidst other vehicles with headlights glaring. Dark-suited men stand guard. Marwan pushes Ferris down a trash-littered slope towards Hani. Beside Hani stands a hooded figure, bound and kneeling, with an armed agent nearby. Ferris and Hani lock eyes, Ferris nods, then watches Hani and his men intently. Shifting his gaze, Ferris looks at the hooded figure, Skip, with contempt. He lunges, punching and kicking Skip, sending him sprawling down the slope. Ferris spits at him and climbs back up, leaving Skip prone with hands tied.\n\nThe scene shifts to Washington D.C., the Capitol Building prominent amidst the city grid. Ferris sits alone at a lakeside cafe, sipping from a take-away coffee cup. Hoffman approaches, only to have Ferris kick his chair over. Hoffman eyes Ferris over his glasses, undeterred.\n\nLater, an SUV traverses a forest track, halting at a house flanked by two communications towers. Ferris alights, greeted by a casual, bespectacled man with light-brown hair, smoking a cigarette. It's Garland, who shakes Ferris' hand warmly. Inside the cluttered house, Garland leads Ferris past computers and a pet parrot, pointing at a screen. He examines photographs, brow wrinkled in thought.\n\nThe final scene unfolds in a metropolis of skyscrapers and construction cranes, where Ferris, in a hotel room, towels his wet hair and applies a foamy white solution.\n\nThroughout the film, the narrative seamlessly blends moments of tension and connection, offering glimpses into a world of intrigue and danger.",
    "809": "In the opening moments of the film, Ferris examines his reflection in a mirror, his light-brown highlighted hair catching the light. The scene then shifts to an office on a bustling construction site, where he engages in conversation with a bald agent disguised as a construction worker. Their exchange is interrupted when Sadiki enters the room. During this, Tony secretly photographs the handshake between Sadiki and Al-Masri from the discreet vantage point of a car.\n\nFerris proceeds to a hotel, collecting a room key from the front desk clerk before ascending the stairs and navigating a corridor to his room. Upon entering, he traverses the space and steps out onto the balcony. With a daring move, he scales the exterior wall, carefully traverses a narrow ledge, and gains access to the adjacent balcony. Pushing aside a long curtain, he peers through the French windows into the room.\n\nHis eyes zero in on a laptop resting on the dressing table. Ferris inserts a small device into the back of the computer, switches it on, and begins typing. The screen displays an intimate family photo of Sadiki. Ferris then dials a number on his cell phone. Meanwhile, Garland is seen working at a computer, and files start to appear on Ferris's laptop screen.\n\nConcurrently, Sadiki arrives in the hotel lobby, retrieves his room key from the desk, and makes his way upstairs. Hearing Sadiki's approach, Ferris hurriedly shuts the laptop and turns off the desk light, swiftly exiting through the French windows and retreating to the neighboring balcony. Inside the room, Sadiki retrieves money from a bag, pockets it, adjusts a chair, and notices the open French windows. He pulls back the curtain and secures the window.\n\nThe narrative shifts to Hoffman, who is engrossed in a kids' soccer match, capturing a photo of his daughter as she prepares to throw in the ball, all while conversing on his hands-free mobile. The environment transforms to Queen Alia International Airport in Amman, where a jet lands smoothly on the runway. Ferris is met by Marwan in a corridor, who then escorts him to an office where Hani is engrossed in a newspaper. Ferris takes a seat, and Hani sets his paper aside as Ferris is introduced to Skip. Shortly after, Ferris climbs into the back of an SUV.\n\nIn another setting, Aisha takes Ferris's blood pressure at a health clinic, removing the cuff afterward with a smile shared between them. Ferris then visits a cafe, selecting a pastry before the man behind the counter packs them into a box. Driving through town in an SUV, Ferris parks near an apartment block. Dressed in brown trousers and a white shirt, he ascends the stairs with the box of pastries in hand.\n\nAisha opens the door with a welcoming smile, and Ferris enters, following her inside. Yousef and Rowley are engrossed in a football match on TV, while Cala sets bowls on the table. Ferris joins the boys, leaning in closer as they nod in acknowledgment.

Meanwhile, in a bustling store, a group of teenage girls are absorbed in trying on vibrant, unique shoes. Near them, a young girl is trying on plain, brown shoes, drawing giggles from the teenagers. Her mother guides her out and onto the street, where the little girl is captivated by women shopping for clothes and witnesses a transaction with a credit card.\n\nYears pass, and that little girl, now grown and named Rebecca, enters a luxury store. She playfully sprays on perfume and warmly embraces a shop assistant, while her colleague, Claire, watches with a smirk. Later, Rebecca is seen scrutinizing her credit card bill, holding up a card she thought was missing. In a washroom, her friend Suze recites details from Rebecca's resume. Rebecca, her long, red hair flowing and draped in a fashionable tartan cape, descends upon a trendy shopping street. She pauses before the window of Denny and George, her excitement palpable as she spots a green chiffon scarf adorning a mannequin.\n\nVenturing inside, she makes a deliberate journey towards the scarf, only to have the mannequin surprisingly address her. Undeterred, Rebecca approaches a store assistant, briefly tenses, then beams with joy as she presents a second credit card. With a newfound energy, she hastens towards a hot dog stand, despite the long queue. The man ahead of her pays for her hot dog with a $20 bill and turns to reveal his face. With the green scarf billowing behind her, Rebecca rushes towards a towering, glass-topped building. She ascends in an elevator and approaches the reception desk, her apricot-colored briefcase in hand.\n\nA pair of striking, six-inch heels come into view, worn by a tall, blonde woman in a black dress with a fur collar. The woman gives Rebecca a quick, dismissive glance. Rebecca's bag suddenly springs open, but she manages a forced smile. The blonde, Alicia, offers a lofty smile in return before walking away. Turning back to the receptionist, Rebecca snatches a visitors' card from his grasp. In a waiting room filled with professionals engrossed in their newspapers, the brunette next to her casts disapproving looks at Rebecca.\n\nSoon, Rebecca finds herself in the office of the man from the hot dog stand, who is English. Startled, she removes the scarf and hastily discards it under a desk. As he takes his seat, he recognizes her, causing Rebecca to fumble with the lock on her case. The editor makes a face, and Rebecca freezes, looking like a deer caught in headlights. He rests his chin on his hand, regarding her with a kind expression. As she leaves, Rebecca collides with a glass partition and wanders back to the office beneath massive fashion posters, the sun bleaching the pavement. Upon her return, she finds an immediate termination notice awaiting her. Both she and her friend stare at the phone in disbelief.",
    "812": "In the opening scene, Suze's boyfriend, Tarquin, stands in a state of shock, clutching a lamp. The girls, deflated, sit slumped nearby. Following Suze's abrupt gesture towards the door, Tarquin hands her the lamp. In the kitchen, Suze forcefully pushes a pile of bills towards Rebecca, who promptly pushes them back. The girls quickly down shots of alcohol before rushing out into the street. Their hurried exit leads to Rebecca tumbling off her bed. Undeterred, they sprint to a nearby post box. En route, they encounter a bag lady pushing a loaded supermarket trolley.\n\nThe following day, Rebecca is at a flea market with her parents, Jane and Graham. Her dad performs a magic trick, capturing everyone's attention. Amidst the bustling market, a waistcoat catches Rebecca's eye, and she checks her phone. She then ascends in the lift of the Dantay-West building. As a postal worker wheels in a trolley of mail, Rebecca spots her pink envelope among the stacks. The lift doors open, and a man wheels out a clothes rail, forcing Rebecca to step aside. Seizing the opportunity, she slips her arm into a coat on the rail and tries to snag her letter with her stiletto heel, swinging it at the post trolley. She quickly hides in a blue fur as Alette walks away. Left alone, Rebecca lies on the floor, finally clutching her letter.\n\nRebecca looks around, taking in the clothes rail and fashion stills adorning the wall. She sits on a creaky chair, sharpening her pencil, while a prim PA giggles nearby. Luke casts a strange glance at Rebecca, prompting her to turn towards Hayley, who grins vacantly. Later, Rebecca and Suze browse in a bookshop, where Rebecca attempts to copy something from a book. They end their day watching a DVD at home.\n\nRebecca begins to pack clothes into plastic bags, stuffing them into an overfilled cupboard. At the office, dressed in pink, she searches for something on her pink laptop, leaning in to read the results. Meanwhile, at a conference, all eyes are on a nervous Rebecca. Luke grins like a Cheshire cat, seemingly pleased with the situation, while Mr. Xander appears cornered. Despite the tension, Rebecca beams with newfound optimism.\n\nAs she walks down a street, a sample sale flier floats down and lands on her chest. Meanwhile, in his penthouse, Luke's boss, Ryan, enthusiastically plays virtual golf. Rebecca joins a queue for the sample sale, watching as women emerge from a door with their purchases. Another door opens, and the women in the queue crane their necks to see inside.",
    "815": "In the bustling opulence of a party, a woman notices a loose thread on her jacket, which she inadvertently tears while trying to fix it. Alicia, ever the social butterfly, glides over to Alette, while Rebecca, her long crimped hair bouncing, dashes to a side table, attempting to conceal the tear with a canape. Meanwhile, two women step out from the powder room. Rebecca, in a hurried attempt to exit, collides with a woman who is indulgently sipping champagne. The impact causes Rebecca's jacket to snag on the door, sending beads scattering across the floor. The champagne-drinking woman stumbles, and they both tumble into each other's arms. The woman, trying to regain her balance, tugs on Rebecca's other sleeve. Ultimately, Rebecca, now sans jacket, helps the tipsy woman to her seat.\n\nLater, Rebecca finds herself in the kitchen, her dress bearing an uncanny resemblance to a waitress uniform. She is thrust into the ballroom with a tray of food, desperately trying to retreat back into the kitchen. The stern manager, however, blocks her path with a hiss. Facing Alette's table, Rebecca spins around and accidentally collides with a waiter, sending a platter of fish flying. Luke swiftly rises to his feet, deftly taking Rebecca's tray. Alicia's lips purse in disapproval, while Alette can't help but giggle at the spectacle.\n\nAs the night wears on, the romantically lit rooftop becomes the backdrop for a tender moment. Luke, chivalrously removing his tuxedo, drapes it around Rebecca's shoulders. With an enigmatic sideways glance, their lips meet in a stolen kiss.\n\nThe next morning, Rebecca strides into work, radiating confidence, in a red dress paired with a fluffy orange shrug and matching orange bag. A soft smile plays on her lips as she rides the escalator. A man in a gray coat rides a lower escalator, and Rebecca coolly struts away before breaking into a run, darting into a lift. A black briefcase blocks the closing doors, allowing Derek Smeath to enter.\n\nAs Smeath takes his position on the other side of the lift, Rebecca steals a glance at him—dark hair, pale complexion, glasses, and a gray raincoat. The lift makes its way to the Dantay-West Publications floor, where a number of people disembark, and more step in. Rebecca's eyes are drawn to Smeath's sturdy, black briefcase. She retrieves her mobile, scrolling past luxury stores to find Derek Smeath's name. Slowly, she raises the phone to her ear, flashing a smile at a newcomer to the lift. Smeath remains stoic, unmoving. Rebecca hastily cancels the call and shoves the phone back into her bag, her eyes wide with horror as she frantically searches through it.\n\nThe lift arrives at the Trout and Bass offices on the fifth floor, and Rebecca makes a hasty exit, looking back just as Smeath's eyes meet hers. A slow, smug smile spreads across his face, prompting Rebecca to dash for the stairs. She bursts through the office door just as Smeath steps out of the lift. Rebecca freezes, watching as Smeath is forcibly removed from the premises. As he disappears from view, her frozen smile relaxes, signaling a moment of relief. Meanwhile, Alette's chauffeur-driven car pulls up to a store, continuing the day's events.",

In a fit of rage, Bernie turns on Jacob, landing a solid punch. He then vandalizes the windmill, tearing off its sails and tossing them aside. A chaotic wrestling match ensues among the four men, culminating in a collective tumble to the ground. Eventually, they sit on a wall, nursing their wounds as police officers arrive.\n\nThe officers leave as abruptly as they appeared, and an awkward silence settles over the group. Jacob chuckles, drawing the attention of David and Bernie, who turn to stare at Cal. Emily sighs heavily, while Hannah and Jessica study the ground, avoiding eye contact. Bernie limps away, Jessica scrambling after him. She nervously combs her fingers through her ponytail as Robbie watches them leave, his expression inscrutable. Eventually, Robbie follows them but stops short as Bernie and Jessica reach the end of the driveway. Jessica glances back, ashamed, causing Robbie to turn away, dejected.\n\nBack at the wall, the remaining three men sit in silence. Cal stands up, prompting a bitter smile and head shake from Emily. Hannah, visibly upset, frowns and signals Jacob to follow her as she walks away. Emily shoots Cal an angry glare before he, too, departs. Cal finds Robbie leaning against the house, offers him a smile and a nod, and then continues on his way.\n\nMolly, seated on the garden steps, cradles her head in her hand as Cal trudges down the driveway. Later, at school, Robbie sits alone, ignored by passing students. He tentatively presses Jessica's name on his phone while she, in her bedroom, stares vacantly into the distance. Hannah and Jacob are together in Jacob's apartment, holding a phone. Emily, meanwhile, sits at her desk, writing and wearing a sad expression.\n\nAfter school, Cal waits by his car, but Robbie coldly ignores him and walks away.

Underneath one of the tables, a woman's high heels and a man's Brogues inch towards each other. This cautious dance is not unique; other couples throughout the restaurant mirror the scene, their feet nuzzling and sliding together as if pulled by an unseen force. However, one couple stands out—a man in running shoes and a woman in high heels sit noticeably apart from each other, their middle-aged silhouettes studying menus rather than engaging in playful footsie. The man, Cal, casts a glance at the woman, Emily, who is absorbed in the menu. He gazes at her intently, almost in disbelief. Emily tries to speak but hesitates, her words caught in her throat.\n\nSimultaneously, in a lively house, a teenage girl chases a younger girl, Molly, who dives onto a sofa. The older girl, Jessica, tickles Molly, causing her to knock over a photo frame before scampering off. The cracked glass reveals a photo of Emily and Cal in happier times, their arms wrapped around each other, smiles beaming. Jessica, the babysitter, picks up the frame and examines it thoughtfully. A wistful smile crosses her face as she gently places her hand over Emily's image, leaving only Cal visible.\n\nMeanwhile, Emily and Cal drive home in silence, the tension palpable. Emily steals awkward glances at Cal, her mouth opening and closing as she struggles to find words. She licks her lips nervously, but Cal remains stoic, staring straight ahead. Emily shakes her head in frustration as they arrive at the house, where Jessica is tidying up, clearly disgusted by something. Upstairs, Robbie, a 13-year-old boy, enters and leans against an archway, hands in pockets, wearing a rueful expression before sighing deeply. Jessica cringes, deep in thought.\n\nIn a bar elsewhere, two young women sit together. Liz watches Hannah with concern as Hannah sulks, her shoulders sagging. A confident man strides through the bar, his polished brown leather shoes and maroon suit catching the eye.\n\nBack at the house, the tension between Emily and Cal reaches a boiling point. Cal, with a hard expression, gets out of the car and tumbles onto the road, listless. Emily screeches to a halt and rushes to his side, finding him hunched over. She looks at him in disbelief, trying to help, but he stands up on his own and trudges back to the car, leaving Emily staring after him, the weight of their unspoken words heavy in the air.",
    "822": "In a bustling upmarket bar, Hannah grins broadly at Jacob, who watches her fondly as she eagerly makes her way towards the door, coat in hand. Meanwhile, Cal navigates his car along a dimly lit street, with Jessica seated uncomfortably beside him. She steals occasional glances at Cal, who remained focused on the road, her discomfort evident in her body language. Cal, noticing her nervousness, shakes his head slightly, trying to ease the tension. Jessica acknowledges him with a nod, and Cal responds with a reassuring smile, though he seems to grapple with his own emotions, covering his mouth and running a hand through his hair.\n\nPulling up outside a house, Cal brings the car to a halt. Jessica, her brow furrowed, nods and steps out of the vehicle. Standing tall yet slightly awkward, she watches as Cal drives away, leaving her with a forlorn expression.\n\nBack at the bar, the crowd begins to thin out. Cal sits alone, his head resting on his hand, staring glumly at the counter. He drums his fingers, smiles gently to himself, and turns to engage a woman seated nearby. She acknowledges him briefly before returning to her conversation with a friend. Cal, undeterred, taps his glass on the bar and laughs at his own joke, drawing the attention of Jacob, who is entertaining a group of women.\n\nThe following day, a balding man navigates an open-plan office, knocking on a glass door to speak with a colleague. Cal, receiving a pat on the back and a round of applause from his colleagues, closes his eyes briefly, taking in the moment. Later, in the pouring rain, Cal stands solemnly by a rental truck, overlooking a pretty garden filled with white and red rose bushes, a wooden bench, and a climbing frame. Emily, tears welling in her eyes, pinches the bridge of her nose and nods at Cal. Their gazes linger intensely before Cal gets into the truck and reverses, leaving Emily to walk alongside, arms folded, before looking down in resignation.\n\nThat evening, Cal returns to the same lively bar, sitting alone at the counter nursing a vodka cranberry. He spots Jacob, dining alone, who wipes his mouth and puts on his suit jacket before approaching a table of young women. Cal watches disapprovingly, shaking his head and sighing as Jacob begins to chat with the group.

Placing a Macy's bag on the bar, Bernie stands up and begins to leave, Cal watching him go with a bewildered frown before shrugging and smiling. Meanwhile, Jacob is seated at a table with a woman, engrossed in their conversation. Cal, looking woeful, glances over at Jacob, who beckons him to come over. Cal hesitates, looking over his shoulder, but Jacob waves him over again. Cal considers Jacob thoughtfully, then picks up his drink and cologne, making his way to Jacob's table just as the woman departs.\n\nCal nods at Jacob and takes a seat, lowering his glass to stare at him. Jacob takes a drink, nodding back at Cal, who studies him intently. Jacob cocks his head, and Cal nods in response. Mirroring Jacob, Cal takes a drink without using his straw. Jacob then gestures to the woman, points at Cal, and rises to leave with her, the dark-haired woman grinning at Cal as they walk away. Cal watches them go, then relaxes into his chair, taking a sip from his straw.\n\nThe scene shifts to a lively gathering at a house. Molly eagerly dances in front of the TV while Cal and Robbie lean against the kitchen counter. Robbie, resting his head on his hands, receives a smile from Jessica, causing him to fidget awkwardly and look down. Later, Cal is seen ascending an escalator at the mall, strolling through the bustling shopping center. Meanwhile, Hannah and Liz are at a bar with friends, raising their glasses in a toast. A dark-haired, somewhat gawky guy kisses Hannah, making her smile excitedly. She looks over at her boyfriend, who is engrossed in his phone alongside another guy doing the same. Hannah's smile fades as she gazes at him, her eyes darting nervously.\n\nUp on the mall's roof terrace, Jacob stands by a glass barrier, taking a bite of folded pizza. Dressed smartly in a dark suit, brown shoes, and sunglasses, he leans against the barrier, looking up as Cal approaches. Cal is clad in a baggy striped polo shirt, blue jeans, and running trainers. Jacob checks his watch, shrugs, then abruptly tosses Cal's trainers over the barrier, slaps him on the cheek, and marches off. Cal smiles in disbelief but ultimately relents, pulling out his wallet. Jacob looks down at the wallet, then frowns at Cal with incredulity.\n\nThe scene transitions to Cal trying on various shirts and ties, accompanied by Jacob as they browse racks of sunglasses. Cal is seen with loads of shopping bags, his credit card being swiped at multiple stores, including a beauty product shop.",

Cal slips off his wedding ring, and the two men venture into the crowded bar. Jacob drifts away, leaving Cal to sit next to the woman. Cal's intense gaze and a playful wink spark a connection, and they end up at his apartment, passionately kissing in the soft glow of dim lighting. The woman takes control, pinning Cal to the couch.\n\nThe next morning, Cal bids farewell to the woman, Kate, her hair tousled from the night's activities. Though she leaves, Cal's escapades are far from over. Over a series of nights, he is seen charming various women at the bar, his attire changing each night but his intent remaining the same. He eventually leaves the bar hand-in-hand with a young woman in a revealing green dress. Meanwhile, Jacob, observing from the bar, smirks and rubs his head.\n\nThe narrative then turns to Jessica, who, at school, cautiously watches a blonde girl from behind her locker door. She follows the girl, who playfully claps her hands like flippers when Jessica catches up. As Jessica rounds a corner, she's greeted by an unusual sight: a red curtain in the middle of the yard, behind which Robbie stands on a platform. Their eyes meet, his filled with sadness. Jessica, startled, drops her tray and walks away, leaving Robbie to sigh and retreat back into the school.\n\nFinally, the film gives a glimpse of Emily's tranquil garden. Under the bright sun, the hedge is carefully trimmed, the rose bush pruned, and the grass mowed. Emily watches the scene from her porch, a content smile on her face.",
    "837": "In a burst of surprise, Sandy does a double-take, smiles, and waves shyly as she makes her way to the bar. Meanwhile, a man smiles at Diana while standing, prompting her to nervously fiddle with her necklace. Soon, they are seated at a table boasting a stunning view of the Gateway Arch. Sandy sips champagne, her initial smile fading as he gazes into her now somber eyes. Diana, trying to hold back tears, takes a sip of champagne and dabs at her eyes. Sandy's expression softens, and she looks down at her hands, wiping her cheeks. He offers her a napkin just as Ken, the hotel manager, enters with several policemen trailing behind Sandy.\n\nThe scene abruptly changes as officers cuff the pair, Sandy casting a frightened look at Diana. They are led out of the restaurant, past gawking patrons, and into the hall where an elevator awaits. Inside the elevator, Julian and Marisol stand at the front, dressed elegantly in a nice suit and a sleek, black dress. Diana's eyes widen in recognition, glancing between Sandy and the newcomers. As Marisol turns away, Sandy steps forward, sizing Julian up. The group exits into the lobby, where Julian glances back briefly before Sandy and Diana are escorted out, sharing a concerned look as the others veer off down a different hallway.\n\nMeanwhile, Paolo, confined to his prison cell, grasps his phone. In a sudden burst of violence, the skiptracer shoots Julian in the leg and Marisol in the foot, leaving them to lie in the trunk of a car. Outside, an officer ushers Diana to a squad car, where she stares ahead, avoiding Sandy's gaze. The skiptracer watches intently from the thugs' silver sedan, following closely as the squad car pulls away.\n\nThe chase ensues down a construction-filled street, with the skiptracer in hot pursuit. Diana, with a determined glare, uncuffs one hand and kicks out the back windshield. The skiptracer swerves, executes a 180-degree spin, and slams into the squad car. Another car rear-ends them, forcing Sandy and Diana to crawl out. Undeterred, the skiptracer aims his vehicle like a weapon, barreling through traffic dividers and knocking cars out of his path. They spot a highway beneath them as the skiptracer steers through oncoming traffic. In a desperate attempt to escape, Sandy trips off the curb, landing in a closed-off lane, while the skiptracer crashes through the dividers, heading straight for him.",
    "839": "Trish begins the day lying on her back, staring at the ceiling before turning to her husband, Sandy. She tenderly grabs his shoulder, leaning in to kiss his head. Sandy responds with a brief smile, and the couple shares a moment of thoughtful silence. Trish tilts her head to glance at Sandy again, kissing the back of his neck before lying down behind him, rubbing his shoulder affectionately.\n\nSandy later walks into the living room, finding his two young daughters sleeping on the couch. Diana, their babysitter, sleeps on the floor beside them, holding Frannie's hand. Sandy stands over the trio, switching off a table lamp before slowly leaving the room. The camera lingers on Diana and Frannie's joined hands.\n\nAwakening later, Sandy checks the clock and buries his face in his pillow before heading down the hall. He discovers his daughters, Frannie and Jessie, wearing Diana’s flashy makeup. Jessie gets up and retrieves a note, handing Sandy a folded slip of pink paper.\n\nSandy unfolds the note and proceeds to his office, passing men and women in suits. He gives a curt nod to the receptionist and a weak wave to someone else before pausing at his office door, glancing at his name placard. He then joins a conference-room meeting already in progress. Daniel, standing in the room, looks up and points behind Sandy, who turns to see Diana through the glass walls of an office. She is seated across from a detective, with two officers standing nearby.\n\nSandy opens the door and nods stiffly as the officers leave. He shoots Diana a wide-eyed stare before she is escorted away in handcuffs, her flowing black dress trailing behind her. Sandy watches as Diana turns to give him a teary smile before being led off by an officer. Daniel walks away, leaving Sandy standing alone. The scene fades to black.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to Trish carrying a cake across the yard to a table where Sandy cradles their newborn. He checks his watch, and the scene transitions to a prison's visiting yard. Diana holds up an exam with an A-plus grade, giving Frannie a big hug before reaching out for Jessie. She pulls a document from a large, yellow envelope, inspecting it before patting the birth certificate and sliding it over to Sandy. Diana rises from the picnic table, passing behind Sandy before abruptly embracing him. He looks at her and smiles, gathering up the envelope and standing, glancing at the paperwork in his hands.",
    "835": "In a bustling office, an elegant, well-dressed man glances at his sleek cell phone and takes the call. Meanwhile, in the lively chatter of a food court, a jubilant, plump redhead grins broadly, punching her fist into the air in triumph as she converses on her cell phone. We then find her in a disorderly house, vigorously towel-drying her hair before turning to a keypad to input a sequence of numbers. A string of counterfeit IDs, each bearing her photograph, dangles along a mirror. With a whirr, a machine dispenses a credit card embossed with the name \"Sandy.\" The redhead adds it to her growing collection of fraudulent cards, her face set with resolve as she departs.\n\nNext, our redheaded fraudster saunters into a trendy bar, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. She zeroes in on a pair of men tossing back shots and sidles up to the bartender, slipping him Sandy's credit card. One shot turns into many, and she gleefully joins the revelers, even chugging an entire bottle of vibrant green liqueur. With a flourish, she holds the empty bottle aloft, and the bartender dutifully adds the hefty tab—now over $2,000—to Sandy's card.\n\nEmboldened, the redhead climbs onto a table, hurling a bottle across the room. In a spectacular display, she lunge for the chandelier, only to crash onto the floor, where she lies prone as stunned onlookers gather. Suddenly, she springs to life, high-fiving patrons as an exasperated bartender approaches. Before he can react, she delivers a swift punch to his throat, sending him crashing to the ground.\n\nThe night takes a sharp turn with the arrival of a police car, its lights casting a stark glow on the bar's facade. Two officers emerge, leading the unruly redhead out. In a crude display, she breathes into a tube before turning to spew a stream of lurid green vomit onto one of the officers. As he recoils, she pivots, facing his partner. At the station, she stands, sullen, before a height chart, her earlier bravado apparently vanished.\n\nAcross town, the real Sandy is surrounded by the warm glow of family. His beautiful wife and two young daughters fuss over him as he sits before a birthday cake. She presents him with a playful paper tie, which he gladly accepts before hoisting her up and gently pressing her face into the cake's frothy icing. She laughs, straddling his lap to look him in the eyes. The couple shares a tender kiss, and as she raises an eyebrow, he sweeps her off her feet, carrying her out of the room.\n\nThe following day, Sandy embarks on a sluggish commute down a crowded highway. Upon arrival at his workplace, he steps out of an elevator and makes his way to his office, where a suited co-worker approaches him. Setting down a file, Sandy follows Cornish's assistant. He peers into an office, where Cornish waves him in. Wordlessly, Cornish points to an earphone, preventing Sandy from sitting. Then, he shuts the door.\n\nSandy navigates to the records room, punching a code into a keypad. Behind a cage wall, he reaches a computer station. He holds up a small packet, displaying a roll call of partners alongside their substantial bonuses. At the bottom, a conspicuous name catches his eye: Harold Cornish, $1.2 million. Seated at the computer, Sandy types Cornish's name onto a check before reaching for his buzzing cell phone.",
    "842": "In a swift sequence of events, a redhead snatches Sandy's suitcase, rummaging through it to find clothes and a toiletry bag. Meanwhile, a blue and yellow taxi pulls up outside. Sandy emerges from the back of the cab, clutching a pink slip, his shirt damp with a huge sweat stain down the front. He pays the driver and stealthily jogs along the side of the house, his back now equally soaked in sweat.\n\nCautiously, Sandy enters the back gate and peers through a window, spotting the redhead going through his toiletries. She aggressively applies his deodorant to her armpits as he sneaks into the room, handcuffs at the ready. Surprisingly, she complies but then abruptly punches him in the throat. A scuffle ensues: Sandy grabs her leg, knocking her down, but she retaliates with a slap to his face. Standing up, she backs him into the counter and throws him over a chair before bolting. Sandy, in desperation, hurls a small appliance and then strikes her with a guitar.\n\nAmidst the chaos, a bunch of IDs are scattered around. Two thugs suddenly appear at the door, and a gunshot blast obliterates the doorknob. Sandy and Diana flee as the woman and her male partner, armed with a short gun, burst in. Diana quickly pierces two of the thugs' tires with a knife and rushes into Sandy's car. Sandy, in a frenzied escape, reverses over her mailbox, plows into the neighbor's yard, knocking over a sign, and cuffs their hands together before speeding off. The female thug, however, manages to rip the knife from the tire, pick the lock, free herself, and reach into her shirt.\n\nSandy pulls over, and the woman hitchhikes, glaring at Diana before bolting. Sandy easily catches up to the overweight woman, but Diana snatches his keys and runs, flashing her middle finger. Sandy jogs in front of her, causing Diana to stumble to a stop. Exasperated, Sandy rolls his eyes and crosses his fingers. Diana stares into his eyes, then limps back toward the car, with Sandy following closely behind. He retrieves the keys from the middle of the highway and hurries back to the car.\n\nThe scene shifts to an auto garage where a muscular, tattooed mechanic is working. The female thug watches him nearby, lifting her phone. Elsewhere, an aging man sits in a jail cell, furrowing his brow as a prisoner pays the guard. Meanwhile, in Sandy's car, Diana faces him with wide eyes and pursed lips, dancing in her seat. Sandy changes the radio station, glaring as she mimes playing instruments. They speed over a bridge spanning a small river.\n\nIn another part of town, a roughneck man with weathered skin and a gray goatee approaches a van. The aging man, now driving a brand new van, arrives at a strip mall and stops outside a salon, peering inside. Entering, he finds a young brunette stylist sweeping the floor. The stylist nods and smiles as he eyes the salon.",
    "846": "In the opening scene, a man peers through the passenger window to see a groggy skiptracer slumped against the steering wheel. Suddenly, the side door of the vehicle swings open, and Diana tumbles out, landing on her feet. She is bleeding from her nose but manages to embrace the man. As they separate, he glances back just in time to witness a tractor-trailer smashing into the rental car, reducing it to a mangled wreck. Sandy, frozen in shock, stares at the destruction before turning to Diana and giving her a soft nod.\n\nLater, Sandy is behind the wheel of a beat-up van, navigating a narrow dirt road. Meanwhile, in an office, Big Chuck is seated opposite Marisol and Julian. Chuck's initial smile vanishes as he eyes the thugs, and in a sudden burst of violence, Julian slams Chuck's head against the desk. Back in the van, Diana is rummaging through their belongings as the temperature gauge begins to rise. Sandy pulls over when steam starts billowing from the hood. He steps out to inspect the damage, while Diana busies herself with duct-taping the unconscious skiptracer. Taking a moment for herself, she takes a sip of water, touches Sandy's chest, and gently grazes his beard with her nose. Sandy, meantime, props open the hood, allowing the steam to vent out.\n\nSandy's gaze shifts to a nearby sign before he opens the van's door, revealing the skiptracer restrained with duct tape, his breaths deep and audible. The scene then cuts to a state trooper directing traffic past Sandy's wrecked sedan. As Julian and Marisol drive by, they overhear a witness recounting the event. Returning to Sandy and Diana, they are now seen walking along a deserted road, Sandy on his cell phone. He shoots Diana a glance, but she looks away, avoiding his gaze.\n\nAs night falls, a pickup truck approaches. Diana gives a thumbs-up sign, and Sandy shows her his phone. They later start a fire, the warm glow illuminating their faces. Sandy looks up, and Diana closes her eyes briefly. He shrugs nonchalantly before lying down on his side near the fire. Diana snuggles up behind him but then pulls her arm away. Their peaceful moment is interrupted when a snake begins to slither towards them. It inches closer, and as Sandy glances back at Diana, the snake slithers into his pants.\n\nStartled, Sandy jumps up and frantically removes his jeans, tossing them into the woods. Unbeknownst to him, another snake descends from a tree, dropping onto his shoulders. Diana quickly dips a stick into the fire and swings it at the snake, which has begun to tighten around Sandy's neck. Despite her efforts, the snake sinks its fangs into Sandy's neck. Diana strikes it repeatedly with the stick until Sandy collapses to the ground. She continues to hit the snake and then tosses it away before tugging at it to help Sandy pry its teeth from his neck. Finally, she discards the snake and shakes her hands, trying to rid herself of the haunting sensation.\n\nThe next morning, a cargo train rumbles past a rusty, disheveled station. Diana is applying makeup while Sandy lies on a bench in dirty khakis. As he awakens, he reaches for his neck, feeling the tender bite mark. Diana watches him with a warm smile. Sandy gets up and walks away, moving towards the ticket booth. He looks back at Diana, pacing thoughtfully as the camera fades out.",
    "850": "In the throes of a tense moment, he stands, briefly grasps her shoulder, and then walks away. Charlie's forehead is creased with anxiety. Outside, an eerie mist drifts over the outstretched hands of a horde of possessed individuals, who sway slowly from side to side under the glow of a full moon peeking through dark clouds. An ominous presence looms overhead, its gaze fixed on the diner.\n\nBob and Jeep enter the diner, where Charlie stands transfixed as Michael slowly approaches her. Suddenly, Sandra snatches the baby. Michael levels his gun, and at that moment, something descends rapidly towards the diner. Beside Charlie, Audrey shakes her head in dismay. Outside, a bright light bathes the possessed, and an intense white light pierces through the diner's entrance. The door bursts open. In a shocking turn, Michael shoots Sandra in the head, causing her to jerk backward and drop the baby. Jeep dives and catches the infant just in time.\n\nA towering, muscular figure with enormous black wings emerges from the blinding light—Gabriel. He spreads his wings and swings a mace down towards the baby. Holding the child, Jeep rolls out of the way, and the mace gouges a hole in the floor. Bob fires at Gabriel, but the winged figure spins, deflecting the bullets with his wings wrapped protectively around him. With a swift slice, Gabriel cuts across Bob's chest, causing him to drop his gun and clutch his bloody wound. Gabriel then strikes Bob across the face, sending him crashing onto a cooker. Amidst the chaos, Michael hands Jeep some keys.\n\nJeep, Charlie, and Audrey rush to a door and fling it open, revealing a pathway lined by the possessed, their heads bowed low. Jeep steps out, pistol in hand, followed by Charlie holding the baby, and Audrey close behind. The possessed remain motionless as mist floats above their bowed heads. Inside the diner, Gabriel confronts Michael, who shakes his head slightly. The possessed part ways, allowing Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey to pass through. They reach a figure with a bag over its head, standing in front of a police car. The figure wheezes and slams the car's hood with a stick.\n\nQuickly, Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey climb into the police car. Michael approaches Gabriel, who studies him intently. Jeep starts the engine and drives away, keeping a careful eye on the wing mirror. Michael steps right up to Gabriel, clasping his hand against the winged figure's cheek and looking deeply into his eyes. Gabriel's eyes moisten, and he looks down, his lips moving as if struggling to find words. He clutches Michael's hand, gazing intently into his eyes before pushing him away.\n\nMichael readies his assault rifle, and blades extend from Gabriel's mace. Gabriel spreads his wings and lunges towards Michael, who fires and leaps out of the way, setting the stage for a climactic confrontation.",
    "852": "In a series of swift and chaotic events, a car speeds past a sign, marking the beginning of a thrilling chase. Suddenly, the back window explodes as Gabriel lands forcefully on the roof. In a fit of rage, he tears off the roof lights and pounding it with his fists. The vehicle's occupants, Jeep and Audrey, attempt to deter him, with Jeep firing shots upward. Despite the gunfire, Gabriel manages to cling to the back of the car, even as it swerves erratically. In a desperate struggle, Gabriel manages to knock Jeep's hand, causing a flare to ignite inside the car. Gabriel tries to secure himself within the shattered back window, his actions growing more frantic as he grabs Audrey's arm, striking her, and then seizes Jeep's gun arm. Jeep fights back, but Gabriel gains the upper hand, clamping his hand over Jeep's eyes and blinding him temporarily. Meanwhile, Charlie, holding her baby tightly, watches in horror.\n\nThe car spirals out of control, the speedometer climbing rapidly from 90 to 110 before Jeep slams on the brakes, sending Gabriel hurtling out of the front window and onto the road. The car careens off the path, hitting a bump and rolling into a ditch, landing upside down. Jeep, disoriented and upside down in his seat, struggles to free himself, while Charlie manages to escape, standing by as Jeep finally extricates himself from the wreckage. With Charlie's support, they begin a arduous climb up a steep hill, their progress hindered by the increasing gradient and the struggle to find secure handholds.\n\nAs they climb, Jeep glances up to see Gabriel descending from the sky, landing ominously in front of them. With a single powerful punch, Gabriel knocks Jeep unconscious. Charlie, seeing her chance, attempts to run but finds herself trapped at the edge of a cliff. Gabriel turns his attention to her, his hand outstretched, but she refuses, looking protectively at her baby. Just as Gabriel seems ready to strike, Jeep leaps onto his back, sending them both tumbling over the cliff onto the ground below.\n\nGabriel, undeterred, tosses Jeep aside and draws a knife, advancing menacingly. As Gabriel raises the knife to strike, a dazzling ray of light descends from the heavens, revealing Michael. Gabriel's face contorts in anger, and he lunges at Michael with the knife. In a swift and powerful motion, Michael strikes Gabriel with his sword, causing him to drop the knife and fall to his knees, blood dripping from the blade. Jeep watches in awe as Michael stands over Gabriel, the tip of his sword at Gabriel's chin, but rather than delivering the final blow, Michael shakes his head and steps away. Defeated but alive, Gabriel rises, spreading his wings and taking off into the sky. Michael then turns to Jeep, who slowly gets to his feet, the intense confrontation finally at an end.",
    "853": "In a tense sequence, a man engages in conversation with Estevez, only to abruptly drop an unspecified item. He then turns his gaze toward the cops, complying with their commands. Estevez approaches to handcuff him, but the man swiftly uses Estevez as a human shield. Meanwhile, Burton begins to convulse, his body trembling as he dances erratically on the spot amidst flickering lights. His eyes wide and face tense, Burton suddenly shoots Estevez. Michael swiftly responds, diving to the ground and firing two handguns at Burton. After placing his weapons in bags, Michael carries them to the police car and drives away, leaving Burton's lifeless body on the sidewalk. The squad car, marked with the number 1127, speeds past buildings, their lights shutting off as it passes.\n\nInside a modest two-door trailer, a man in his late 20s awakens with a start, switching on a light and looking around from his chair, a small television to his left. Stepping out into the early morning, he walks away from the big gray trailer, hands stuffed in his jacket pockets, his features illuminated by the green neon lights of a sign. He returns to find Jeep, visibly pregnant, sitting on the swings. Charlie's heavily swollen belly is evident as they sit facing opposite directions, Jeep wearing a resigned expression. She stares at him sideways before looking away, rising from the swing to place a hand on his shoulder briefly before continuing back to the trailer. Jeep leaves him alone on the swing, disappearing inside.\n\nAt the Paradise Falls diner, Jeep’s father, Bob, fiddles with a TV set and a lighter. The chef, a tall, bald black man adorned with a crucifix and dog tags, has a distinctive hook for a left hand. A young woman, scantily dressed, leans over a jukebox, drawing the disapproving stare and grunt of a woman seated with a man. As the man glances around and makes a move, Bob and others in the diner turn their attention.\n\nMeanwhile, a man in an SUV cruises along a deserted freeway, a half-smoked cigarette dangling from his mouth. Wearing a brown beanie, scarf, and casual jacket, he enjoys the sunny morning, stubbing out his cigarette to check his cellphone. Spotting a sign for Paradise Falls, he unfolds a map to study it, then notices the diner ahead. Pulling into the forecourt, he sees Charlie standing by a phone box, smoking a cigarette.",

    "857": "A tall, gaunt-faced man, dressed in a light shirt and matching trousers with a dark floppy bow tie, steps in front of his van, headlights still glowing. He pauses, then moves forward, sniffing the air. His arms extend eerily from his sleeves as he bends over and bounds like a stick insect. Mid-leap, Michael shoots him, continuing to fire until the man stops twitching on the ground.\n\nInside a diner, women and a man named Jeep watch anxiously as two columns of cars approach, their drivers seemingly convulsing as they speed towards the diner. Bullets rip into the lead cars, sending them spinning, and a car rolls over in flames. From the roof, Michael spots another convoy and launches a grenade, taking out the lead vehicle and causing a truck to spill its load and crash. Surviving vehicles stop, and their occupants—men, women, children—exit, walking towards the diner with impassive faces.

The intruder, a woman with a contorted young face, pulls Howard out, and as the others try to hold onto him, she cuts Charlie, severing his hand.\n\nMichael, now inside with an assault rifle in each hand, shoots out of the window, battling the relentless horde.

    "861": "In the depths of the sea, a French tricolor flag undulates beneath the surface. Above, a battered wooden galleon tilts precariously to its starboard side, fighting rough seas as it is towed into a dry dock. Rows of weathered, unshaven prisoners strain and grunt in unison, their chained hands gripping heavy ropes to haul the ship onto dry land. Waves relentlessly crash into the dock, leaving the central group of men waist-deep in churning water, while others toil at higher levels. Overseeing the scene from the quay above is a stern man in a blue uniform, Javert, his gaze fixed intently on one particular prisoner who avoids his stare.\n\nThe ship finally secured, the line of prisoners begins to file out of the dock. Javert halts one man—the same who had drawn his scrutiny earlier. This prisoner, tall and bearded with a stooped posture, turns back towards a broken flagpole lying on the ground. Javert gestures for another prisoner, preventing him from assisting. The tall prisoner, Jean Valjean, heaves the long, thick flagpole onto his shoulder, grimacing as he struggles to stand and lug it forward, Javert's cold eyes following his every move. The sodden flag still attached to the pole trails through the water as Valjean labors onward, ultimately dropping the pole at Javert's feet before staggering away from the dry dock, the inspector's gaze never leaving him.\n\nLater, Valjean ascends a mountain, using a sturdy staff to traverse the rocky terrain. He crests a snow-blanketed hill, his solitary figure silhouetted against the sky as he presses on towards a distant cross atop the summit. Upon passing the cross, he gazes ahead, the rising sun painting the horizon with warm hues. With a satchel slung over his shoulder, he pauses at a ledge, taking in the vista of mountains stretching out before him.\n\nComing upon men at work, Valjean stops by a farmer, who reads something—perhaps a letter of introduction. As Valjean continues on his way, a portly town hall officer turns to confer with a guard. Children in the street jeer and pelt Valjean with stones as he passes. Seeking refuge, he warms his hands at an inn's fire, only to be viciously attacked outside, fists and boots brutal against his body.\n\nBruised and weary, Valjean wanders into a churchyard, lying down by the sanctuary. Startled awake by a noise, he finds a kindly bishop holding a lamp, illuminating the darkness. Initially wary, Valjean is invited inside, where he voraciously devours a meal prepared by two women attending the bishop. He watches intently as one of them places silverware into a cupboard before retiring to a bed, where he stares up at the ornate ceiling above.\n\nRising silently, Valjean creeps back to the cupboard, and as the bishop sleeps, he steals the silverware, stuffing it into his satchel before slipping away into the night.",

Breathing quickly, swallowing, and heaving, she sits up, strokes her short hair, and looks back tearfully, her expression solemn. A smartly-dressed man accosts her, but she scratches his face and is pushed away just as Javert approaches. Recognizing Valjean, Fantine turns her back on him, breathing rapidly, and spits in his face when he approaches. Javert raises a hand to halt his men, then picks up Fantine and watches Valjean carry her away.\n\nJavert receives a letter, reads it, and finds Valjean. With a furrowed brow, Valjean rises, only to sit back down, puzzled. Javert bows curtly and leaves, watched intently by Valjean who later kneels at a church altar, packs his belongings, and travels by carriage to court, escorted out by the usher.\n\nMeanwhile, at the hospital, a nurse tends to a semiconscious Fantine, dabbing her forehead before leaving. Valjean enters, and an image of a nine-year-old blonde girl flickers in his mind. As the vision fades, Fantine grows still, her head lolling to the side. Valjean closes her lifeless eyes, bends down, and gently kisses her temple.\n\nJavert, relentless, draws his sword on Valjean. Though initially fended off with a baton, Valjean is disarmed but escapes by diving into the river, leaving no trace. Back at the hospital, Fantine lies at peace.\n\nElsewhere, at a bustling inn, a young, grubby Cosette watches enviously as children play in the snow, glaring at a pretty little girl among them. Inside, the cunning Thenardier tends to his patrons, stirring up trouble and stealing from a silver-haired gentleman's coat. His wife, equally devious, messes with a handsome soldier's jacket, eyeing him flirtatiously. Outside, a mule stands tethered to a crate, a sign of the inn's illicit dealings.",
    "864": "In the heart of a dimly lit forest, a waif-like Cosette, bearing a bucket, spots Valjean approaching. Startled, she drops her burden and scampers to hide behind a tree, her eyes wide with fear. The soft moonlight illuminates her youthful face as she cautiously observes Valjean. Suddenly, her expression brightens, and she steps forward to take his arm. Together, they traverse the town, Valjean carrying the water-filled bucket.\n\nMadame Thenardier intercepts them, seizing the bucket, while her husband, Thenardier, opens his arms to Cosette. The girl shakes her head defiantly, refusing to go to him despite his beckoning. Madame Thenardier gasps in disbelief. Meanwhile, Valjean reclaims his hat from Thenardier and takes Cosette under his wing. He presents her with a doll, and they depart together, Valjean carrying Cosette in his arms.\n\nAt the inn, Javert arrives on horseback but soon rides away. Inside, Madame Thenardier shoves her husband, who attempts a kiss only to be rebuffed. Under the cover of night, Valjean and Cosette journey in a carriage, the child sleeping peacefully with her head on Valjean's lap. He tenderly strokes her hair as the moon casts its silvery glow through the forest trees.\n\nValjean's serenity is shattered when he spots Javert. Hastily, he conceals the doll within his coat, and they alight from the carriage, fleeing hand in hand along the city wall. Javert, on horseback, sees them and gives chase. They dash along a colonnade, Valjean hoisting Cosette over a stone balustrade before jumping over himself. Javert is forced to halt, turning back in defeat.\n\nValjean secures a rope dangling from a building, and while Javert searches the dark alleyways on foot, he ascends a high wall, Cosette watching fearfully. Using the rope, he pulls her up beside him, and they lie still atop the wall as Javert passes beneath them. Once Javert walks away, Valjean lowers Cosette down the other side and climbs down himself, carrying her once more.\n\nThey peer into a chapel bathed in the golden glow of candlelight, where nuns sing melodiously. Valjean, holding Cosette, turns to find a stout, scruffy, balding man with a spade. The man discards his tool and removes his hat—it is Fauchelevant. They follow him, leaving the scene behind.\n\nMeanwhile, high atop a tower, Javert stands before an ornate cross. He closes a Bible and steps out onto a ledge overlooking Paris, a huge stone eagle by his side. The tower soars behind him, crowned with a spire and cross. Far below, in the derelict remains of the Bastille, stands a colossal, decaying elephant monument, a relic of Napoleon's ambitious plans. A ragged, wild-haired urchin emerges from a hole in the elephant's head, climbing out into the wasteland.",
    "865": "In the bustling streets of Paris, a group of urchins emerges from an elephant structure, sliding down ropes before darting across the barren wasteland. Their journey takes them through a restaurant, where they swiftly pilfer food amidst the chaos. Meanwhile, beggars extend their hands to the wealthy Parisians, hoping for a moment of generosity. One of the urchins, Gavroche, boldly leans into a carriage occupied by a finely dressed couple, causing a stir. With agile grace, he traverses the tops of several carriages before disappearing into the crowd. Settling onto the back of a moving carriage, Gavroche observes as young students join the beggars and urchins, their voices rising in unison. Two figures stand prominently on a platform, capturing the attention of the growing assembly.\n\nAs police officers arrive on horseback, the students distribute leaflets, their fervor undeterred by the authorities' presence. A distinguished man with white hair makes his way to his carriage, while his grandson Marius and others raise their fists in solidarity. In the quiet of his attic room, Marius removes a gold ring from his finger and retrieves a pistol from its case, his expression resolute. At his door stands Eponine, the daughter of the Thenardiers, watching him with a thoughtful gaze.\n\nMarius steps out onto the bustling street, pausing to allow a carriage to pass. As he prepares to continue, his attention is drawn across the way, where Jean Valjean is seen giving money to a beggar. Accompanying Valjean is Cosette, now a beautiful young woman with flowing blonde hair. She notices Marius's gaze and offers him a smile as she places a coin in the beggar's hand, leaving Marius captivated. Eponine observes the exchange, her expression tinged with sadness.\n\nMeanwhile, Thenardier lurks by a hovel, his eyes fixed on Valjean and Cosette as they make their escape. Thenardier approaches Javert, dusting off his jacket with an obsequious demeanor. Javert surveys Thenardier with a critical eye before Marius intervenes, grabbing Eponine's arm as she attempts to walk away, a smile playing on his lips.\n\nThe students convene in a tavern, Marius lost in thought amidst the lively gathering. Enjolras, noticing Marius's distraction, frowns in his direction. Marius's attention is soon drawn to Eponine, and he rushes over to her, only for her to walk out, leaving him to exchange a glance with Enjolras before following her.\n\nIn the candlelit sanctuary of her bedroom, Cosette is startled by the sight of a scar on Valjean's wrist as he enters the room. She appears chastened and exits through the front door, leaving Valjean to sit alone, his fingers knitted together in contemplation. Marius, pursued by Eponine, walks down a dark street before pausing to gaze through the railings of Valjean's garden. Cosette approaches him, her path lined with blossom-laden branches, her eyes locked on his. After a tender moment, she returns to the house, prompting Marius to depart. He discovers Cosette's handkerchief on the ground, picking it up before disappearing into the night, leaving Eponine to watch sadly from the shadows.\n\nThenardier walks down the street with his accomplice, Babet, his harsh demeanor evident as he strikes Eponine. Cosette, appearing desperate, receives a candlestick from Valjean, which she places in her bag. She pens a letter, sealing it with wax before rushing to the garden to secure it within the railings. Eponine, ever-present in the shadows, retrieves the letter, her fate intertwined with the unfolding drama.",
    "866": "In the heart of Paris, a tale of revolution and sacrifice unfolds under the relentless downpour. Eponine, secretly in love with Marius, opens a letter addressed to him and reads it, her face etched with distress. As rain soaks the cobbled streets, she walks alone through the dark, her clothes drenched and clinging to her skin.\n\nMeanwhile, tension escalates at the Place de la Bastille. Student protesters and townspeople line the streets, awaiting the procession of General Lamarque's hearse. Gavroche and his fellow urchins watch from their hideout within a statue elephant. Soldiers march down the street, followed by cavalry and the hearse. Enjolras, defiant, waves a red flag and climbs onto the street, joined by Marius and other revolutionaries. Javert, disguised as a civilian, lurks in the crowd.\n\nThe cavalry faces off against the protesters gathered around the hearse. Enjolras and Marius cock their pistols in response to the soldiers raising their swords and muskets. A shot rings out, striking a woman who collapses onto the cobblestones. Chaos erupts as cavalry charges, and men exchange fire with the soldiers. Enjolras shoots while Courfeyrac, one of the students, is knocked down, only to be helped up by Javert.\n\nMarius gallops down the street, and a flurry of activity commence as a barricade is built. An overturned cart, furniture thrown from windows, a cannon, tables, and even pianos are used to fortify the blockade. Students take their positions, shooting from behind the barricade as people chase the cavalry away. Marius's enthusiasm is evident as he beams with excitement. Javert, seizing an opportunity, steals a rosette in a café and pins it to his dark jacket, blending in with the revolutionaries.\n\nAmidst the chaos, a tender moment unfolds as an old woman is kissed before her chair is taken for the barricade. Javert arms himself with a pistol, and a red flag is tossed to Marius, who waves it defiantly atop the barricade. People wave tricolors from their windows in support. Javert, returning to the scene, is overpowered by the students after a brief struggle. Enjolras knocks him out with a club, and the group, weapons in hand, heads to the barricade.\n\nAs night falls, the students man the barricade, aiming their weapons at the approaching platoon of soldiers. Gunfire flickers, illuminating the street with the spark of gunpowder. Soldiers climb the barricade, met with a barrage of shots from the students. A soldier falls dead atop the barrier. Marius, grasping a flaming barrel of gunpowder, prepares to make a stand. Gavroche's cries echo through the air as Eponine, hidden behind the barricade, makes a fateful intervention. A soldier aims at Marius, but Eponine grabs the musket and is shot.\n\nWith a torch in hand, Marius lowers it towards the gunpowder, forcing the officer and his men to retreat. Breathless, Enjolras takes the torch from Marius, signaling the unyielding spirit of the revolutionaries. The night is far from over, and the fight for freedom rages on.",
    "867": "In the pouring rain, a woman sits hunched, clutching a wound on her chest where she has been shot. Marius, seeing her plight, squats down and wraps a comforting arm around her. Her pale face, speckled with glistening raindrops, growing weaker, her eyes gently close. With a tender effort, she reaches out to touch his face, and Marius gazes intently at Eponine. Her hand, however, soon drops lifelessly to her side. Young Gavroche watches the scene unfold, a single tear rolling down his cheek. Marius, with a gentle touch, kisses Eponine's brow, while Enjolras looks on, his face grave. Enjolras then squats down, and together, he and Marius carefully pick up Eponine's lifeless body and carry her away.\n\nMarius, his eyes filled with tears, stares at a letter from Cosette. With the letter clutched in his hand, he approaches Gavroche. The boy hurriedly ascends a dark stairway to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings, where Valjean offers him a coin in exchange for the message. Gavroche pauses briefly before continuing on his way. Valjean, reading the letter, furrows his brow in concern. He looks up to the heavens, then around thoughtfully, contemplating his next move.\n\nStepping outside, Valjean steals a dead soldier's jacket, peaked cap, and musket. Disguised, he makes his way to the barricade where vigilant students keep watch. Removing his cap, he is cautiously let in, with guns aimed at him. Meanwhile, Javert stands with a noose around his neck, beaten and bloody, his gaze slack as he stares at Valjean. Kneeling with his hands tied, Javert is forced to face Valjean, who pulls his head up. They lock eyes for a moment before Valjean hauls Javert to his feet and marches him to a dark corner.\n\nProducing a dagger, Valjean holds it up, standing face to face with Javert. Instead of causing harm, Valjean cuts the ropes binding Javert's wrists. Javert, freed, walks off but turns back to face Valjean. Aiming his pistol, Valjean walks towards him, causing Javert to frown in disbelief. Javert attempts to walk off again, but Valjean fires a shot into a wall, causing Javert to stop and look back before disappearing into the dark.\n\nReturning to the group, Valjean finds everyone sitting around, their expressions serious. He nods at them, and Enjolras begins to address the assembled revolutionaries. Marius, who had been adjusting the barricade, stops to sit with the others. Wine is passed around as Marius sits clutching Cosette's handkerchief, and Valjean, standing nearby, wears a fraught, serious expression. He leans in a doorway, looking at Marius, and eventually stands beside the young man as he sleeps.\n\nMarius awakens and stares fearfully at Enjolras, while everyone else looks thoughtful. Suddenly, a soldier shoots at Gavroche, who has climbed through the barricade. The boy is hit and, despite Marius' attempts to provide cover with his musket, Gavroche is shot again and falls onto his back, lifeless. One of the students rushed to pick him up and carried him back behind the barricade. An army officer watches the grim scene as Enjolras looks around, his expression heavy with sorrow. Despite the students' efforts to shoot down a few soldiers, cannons are rolled forward, signaling an impending assault.",
    "870": "In the quiet of dawn, a beam from a lighthouse sweeps across the shimmering blue ocean, signaling the start of a new day. Kate Armstrong, a pretty brunette in her late thirties, begins her morning routine, her eyebrows raised in contemplation as she dons a pristine white chef's apron in her tidy restaurant kitchen. She meticulously checks the orders and steels herself for the day ahead with a brief moment of respite in the walk-in fridge, leaning against a rack.\n\nThe restaurant hums with life as Kate chats with a middle-aged couple, the Petersons, before they depart. She warmly greets another couple, shaking their hands, then navigates back to the kitchen. Her chefs are engrossed in their tasks, barely acknowledging her presence. Holding two plates of food, Kate turns, her lips pursed, considering their indifference.\n\nAs the day ends, Kate steps out onto the snow-covered streets of New York, her long hair now loose under a black beret. She returns to her modest apartment, dropping her keys and mail by the door, and checks her phone messages before exhaustion claims her, and she falls into a deep sleep.\n\n Known for her dedication, Kate's day begins again at half past four. She visits a bustling fish market before returning home to cook, her blue apron protecting her black top and jeans. A phone call interrupts her culinary rhythm, and she hurries to answer it. Leaving her apartment, she encounters her neighbor Sean on the stairs, a brief, silent exchange occurring between them before she continues on her way.\n\nAt her therapist's office, Kate garnishes a plate of food, sitting down as he begins to eat. She turns away, her emotions tucked safely beneath the surface. Back at the restaurant, chaos ensues as Bernadette, a waitress, collides with a colleague. Pregnant Leah retrieves the fallen bottle, and Bernadette regains her composure. Kate, drawn to the commotion, reluctantly answers the ringing phone, turning away from the kitchen's noise as she listens. Her eyes well up with tears, and she rushes down a hospital corridor, guided by a nurse to young Zoe's room.\n\n Zoe lies in bed, her eyes closed, with grazes above and below her right eye. Kate circles the bed, her sadness palpable as she gazes at her injured niece. Dr. Barton, a balding man in his forties, offers Kate a reassuring pat on the shoulder before retreating. Kate remains, her vigil continuing through the night as she watches over Zoe, eventually succumbing to sleep in the chair beside her bed.",
    "874": "In the quiet of the morning, Kate stirs awake, her eyes fluttering open as she takes stock of her surroundings. Her gaze lands on Zoe, her niece, who is already awake and watching her intently. The pair share a silent, weighty exchange before Kate sits up, her eyes locked onto the young girl's face. Tears begin to stream down Zoe's cheeks, her face a picture of anguish, and Kate responds with a sad nod, a silent acknowledgment of their shared pain. A tear escapes Kate's eye as well, tracing a path down her cheek.\n\nKate drags herself into her apartment, her movements leaden. She unwinds her long, red scarf from around her neck, dropping it onto the answer machine before coming to a halt in the hallway, her coat still clutched in her hand. She seems transfixed, lost in thought, but after a moment, she turns and retraces her steps towards the door.\n\nThe scene shifts to a bustling restaurant. Conversations falter as Kate enters, all eyes drawn to her as she passes by. Paula, noticing Kate's arrival, places her wineglass down on the table. Kate, however, avoids her gaze, instead making her way to the empty kitchen. She ties her apron around her waist, her back to Paula, before walking away, her mind clearly elsewhere. Leah, noticing Kate's distraction and the tears welling up in her eyes, watches her with concern. Kate retreats to the walk-in fridge, huddling on the floor with Christine's letter clutched in her hand. Through the window in the door, Paula observes her, worry etched on her face. As she enters, Kate looks up, her chin trembling, and Paula takes her hands in her own, offering silent comfort.\n\nWe find ourselves in Zoe's hospital room, Kate entering cautiously. She makes her way to the end of Zoe's bed, depositing her bag on the over-bed table before moving it to a chair by the window. She sheds her coat and scarf as she speaks softly to Zoe, who has her gaze fixed on the Bugs Bunny cartoon playing on the TV. Kate takes a seat beside the bed, but Zoe looks away, only offering a faint nod of acknowledgment before turning her attention back to the screen.\n\nUnder the gray skies of New York, a yellow taxicab navigates the rain-slicked streets, Zoe seated in the back. She gazes out of the window, her eyes glazed over, lost in thought. The cab pulls up to Kate's apartment building, a smart brownstone with an inviting set of steps leading up to an arched entranceway. Zoe shoulders a red rucksack as she steps out of the cab, her eyes scanning the building's facade. Inside, Kate leads her on a tour of the apartment. Zoe ventures slowly into her new bedroom, taking in the light and airy space with its large bay window, window seat, and enormous double bed.\n\nAt a cemetery high on a hill, overlooking the city, Zoe stands grim-faced beside her mother's casket. As the other mourners begin to leave, she turns to Kate, and together, they walk away, their steps heavy with grief. Back at Kate's brownstone, an assortment of toys are carried inside, a large, lifelike giraffe leading the way. Zoe clutches a stuffed elephant, and the menagerie of cuddly toys are arranged around her room, a silent attempt to bring comfort in the face of loss.",
    "876": "In the quietude of her room, Kate finds herself immersed in memories as she pages through a photo album. The snapshots reveal a narrative of love and life: Christine with baby Zoe, Christine beaming beside a birthday cake, Zoe clutching a teddy bear, and Christine with Kate, their smiles radiant and arms entwined. Recent photos of Zoe mark the passage of time. With a gentle motion, Kate closes the album and places it on the chest of drawers. She turns off the lamp, slowly circling the bed before sitting down on its edge, lost in thought.\n\nThe next morning, Zoe stands by the bed, gazing down at Kate, who sleeps soundly. As Kate stirs and checks the clock, she finds Zoe in her room, staring intently. Kate sighs, a mix of resignation and affection, and begins to search through a cardboard box in Zoe's room. She pulls out a scarf, but Zoe shakes her head disapprovingly. Kate tries another, but Zoe rejects it too. Undeterred, Kate places the pink, stripy scarf back and moves on to a second box.\n\nZoe follows Kate into the hallway as she picks up her keys and coat. The little girl, wearing a red woolen hat and multicolored scarf, gives a brief nod before looking away. Kate returns with coffee, and they prepare to leave. Outside, scores of children stream towards a large, brown brick school building. Kate and Zoe join the flow, stopping by a yellow school bus parked nearby. Inside, they walk down a corridor adorned with children's artwork. Ellen, a teacher, takes Zoe's hand and leads her away, leaving Kate alone with her thoughts.\n\nLater, Kate is with her therapist, her disbelief palpable as she lies back on the couch, trying to process her emotions. After the session, she stands outside Zoe's school among other parents and guardians. As a gaggle of schoolchildren runs down the steps, Kate's face lights up seeing Zoe emerge on her own. Together, they walk home.\n\nAt home, Zoe sits at the table while Kate brings her a plate of food. A sudden knock at the door has Kate hurrying to answer it. Standing there is a teenager with a nose piercing—Charlotte, a sullen young goth. Kate looks her up and down before glancing at Zoe, who walks past. Turning back to Charlotte, Kate manages an awkward smile. Charlotte steps inside, and Kate closes the door, walking off towards Zoe's room. A silent understanding passes between Kate and Zoe as they share a look.\n\nLater, at the restaurant, Kate walks into the kitchen where Leah and Nick are chatting. She turns off the CD player, causing Nick to look up, slightly annoyed. The staff sits around a table as Nick dishes up spaghetti, passing a plate to Kate. Handsome and shaggy-haired, Nick stares at Kate, a hint of irritation in his eyes. Despite the tension, the restaurant hums with an undercurrent of unspoken emotions and relationships slowly unraveling.",
    "877": "In the opening scene, Nick directs a meaningful gaze towards Paula before carrying a plate of spaghetti to Kate, who is seated at the far end of the table. He places the dish in front of her, drawing the hungry gazes of Leah and Bernadette as they eagerly dig into their own meals. Kate, pausing her crossword, tucks her pencil into her neat bun and takes a bite of the pasta. She casts a petulant glance at Nick, who then returns to Paula. Kate's expression darkens into a glare, and with visible anger, she abruptly stands up and storms out of the room.\n\nRetreating to her office, Kate vents her frustration by slicing a menu in half before attempting to refocus on her paperwork. Later, in the bustling kitchen, she approaches Nick, who offers her a taste from a pan he's cooking. Kate, using her own spoon, declines and walks away, leaving Nick to sample the sauce himself, looking pleased with the flavor.\n\nAs the kitchen hums with activity, Nick is seen smiling and chatting with Leah, their camaraderie drawing a disapproving look from Kate. Leah's laughter rings out, catching the attention of the line cooks. Nick notices Kate's gaze and extends a pan towards her, inviting her to taste his creation. She dismissively shakes her head and wanders off.\n\nThe scene shifts to an array of exquisite desserts meticulously arranged on pristine white plates. Among them are a circular chocolate pud garnished with raspberries, a delicate chocolate teardrop adorned with a swirl of cream, and an immaculate fruit tart. Kate, using a blowtorch, is caught in the act of caramelizing a fourth dessert as Nick enters her workspace, nearly colliding with her. He sets down a plate and picks up a bottle of dessert sauce, while Kate selects another bottle and begins decorating a plate. She briefly acknowledges him before carefully placing a delicate spun-sugar cage over a white chocolate mousse nestled on sliced strawberries.\n\nNick's watchful presence unnerves Kate, causing her to accidentally break the sugar cage. She swiftly moves to the other side of the worktop, carrying the dessert plate and a second sugar cage, with Nick's contemplative gaze following her.\n\nThe tension escalates as Kate seeks a moment of respite in the walk-in fridge. Bernadette hurriedly exits, leaving Kate to lean wearily against a shelving unit. As Nick enters and approaches her, she averts her gaze. He removes his apron, and together they exit the fridge. Kate turns to Leah, whose pleading look does little to soften her cool demeanor towards Nick. Igniting the blowtorch, Kate turns away from him as he walks past her. Distracted, she inadvertently sets a tea towel tucked into her apron on fire. Quickly reacting, she tosses it to the floor and stamps out the flames, adding a dramatic punctuation to the simmering conflict.",
    "880": "Zoe lay on her bed, facing away from Kate. She turned and propped herself up, leading to a silent stare between aunt and niece. Kate's gaze fell first, and she left the room wearing a faint smile.\n\nThe scene shifts to a bustling restaurant kitchen where Zoe was prepping asparagus, with three precious black truffles resting nearby. Kate arrived, grating some truffle onto a roast quail dish before handing it off to a colleague. Zoe, meanwhile, disposed of the asparagus trimmings and, after a disgusted sniff, tossed the truffles into the bin. Kate returned, and upon finding the discarded truffles, retrieved them and stored them in a yellow lockbox filled with even more of the delicacies. Zoe watched, bewildered, while Nick, grinning, chopped onions nearby. He struck up a conversation with Zoe, demonstrating how to handle potatoes before stepping away to take a phone call. Later, Nick offered Zoe a taste of his sauce, which she approved of with a nod. The pair shared a playful moment, with Zoe teaching Nick some lively dance moves.\n\nDinner service began as Nick served pasta to the hungry staff. Zoe attempted to give a plate to Kate, who tried to pass it on, but ultimately accepted it from Zoe and began to eat, acknowledging Nick with a warm smile.\n\nLater, Zoe and Kate took a stroll in the park. Zoe, balancing on benches, leaned in to whisper to Kate before jumping down and walking ahead.\n\nBack at the restaurant, Nick geared up for service, tying on his apron. Meanwhile, at the apartment, Kate looked down from her window to see Zoe pacing outside. She went down to meet her, finding Zoe in the bathroom, standing on a stool to fix her hair. Zoe hurried to the door and rushed downstairs. In the kitchen, Nick checked Kate's cupboards while Kate investigated a box from his bag. Zoe ushered Kate out of the kitchen, and Nick took the opportunity to teach Zoe how to prepare a pizza base.",

Unbeknownst to them, a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, observes their enthusiastic approach from afar, a soft smile gracing her lips as she watches the scene unfold.\n\nTurning away, Lizzie, clad in a simple day dress and straw bonnet, begins her descent down a winding country lane. She takes in the lush greenery surrounding her, breaking into a joyful canter. After gathering a small bunch of wildflowers from the woods, she traverses a sunlit field where a chestnut mare and her foal graze peacefully. Continuing on, she heads towards the nearby village, but upon nearing her home, Longbourn, she circumvents the entrance to avoid her sisters' quarreling voices within.\n\nPeeking into her father's study, Lizzie shares a knowing smile and eye roll with Mr. Bennet before carrying on. Inside the house, chaos reigns as Lydia playfully dons Kitty's bonnet, causing the latter to flee the room in tears, passing Jane in the hallway. Meanwhile, outside the local church, Mrs. Bennet engages in a fervent conversation with a neighbor. Her five daughters trail behind Mr. Bennet as he leads the way back home, Mrs. Bennet eventually disengaging from her chat to hasten after her family.\n\nUpon entering the house, Mr. Bennet promptly deposits his hat and cane, a maid swiftly appearing to tend to Mrs. Bennet. Lizzie and Jane exchange amused smiles, while Lydia casts a dramatic eye roll. Later that evening, Jane sits at her dressing table, carefully brushing her long, golden hair by candlelight. Lizzie, wearing a wistful expression, sits nearby, eventually planting a gentle kiss on Jane's head before retreating to her own bedroom.\n\nDownstairs, the late hour finds Mr. Bennet hunched over his study desk, painstakingly reviewing the household ledgers. He marks a few notes, returns his quill to its holder, and leans back in his chair, weariness etched on his face. With a furtive glance, he reaches for a decanter of spirits. Upstairs, Lizzie gazes at her reflection in the mirror, playfully practicing various facial expressions before finally extinguishing her candle.\n\nSoon, the quiet village bustles with activity as a lavish carriage, led by torch-bearing men, arrives outside The Assembly Rooms. A servant swiftly opens the door, placing the steps for the passengers to alight. Bingley emerges first, grinning at his new surroundings and donning a large Napoleonic-style hat. The more reserved Darcy follows, with the elegant Miss Bingley, resplendent in a grand ball gown and feathered hat, bringing up the rear. The stage is set for their introduction to the local society, unaware of the lasting impressions they are about to make.",
    "885": "In the bustling realm of a grand ball, a tale of pride, prejudice, and burgeoning romance unfolds. The evening commences with the arrival of a third gentleman, Mr. Hurst, who joins the gathering. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy surveys the festive scene with a detached air, his demeanor aloof and reserved.\n\nInside the grand hall, the dancing is in full swing. Men and women, resplendent in pastel gowns, hold hands and twirl in a joyous circle. The lively rhythm is punctuated by the enthusiastic clapping of Sir William Lucas from the sidelines. Among the revelers, Lizzie and Lydia Bennet, dressed in elegant empire-line dresses, are thoroughly enjoying the festivities. With dainty steps, they pair with their partners, engaging in a lively do-si-do before rejoining the circle.\n\nThe ballroom transforms into a kaleidoscope of color as the dancers form a two-line procession before the chamber musicians. In unison, they glide gracefully across the floor, their bright attire and feathery accents creating a breathtaking spectacle. The atmosphere shifts as the Bingley party makes their grand entrance, hushing the room in a wave of awe and anticipation. The new arrivals, clearly uncomfortable, are swiftly greeted by Sir William Lucas, who hurries over to welcome them.\n\nAs the dancing resumes, Lizzie joins her sisters Jane and Mary, along with Charlotte Lucas, Sir William's daughter. Lydia and Kitty, eager to share their excitement, rush to join their mother. With a curt bow, Darcy excuses himself, leaving Mrs. Bennet visibly annoyed. Jane, however, keeps her focus on Bingley, her eyes radiating a growing fondness.\n\nLater, Jane finds herself twirling in Bingley's arms, her smile warm and genuine. Despite their obvious enjoyment, Darcy's disdainful gaze from the sidelines casts a shadow over their merriment. As he continues his survey, Darcy catches Mrs. Bennet belittling him over tea and cake with her inner circle. His attention is then drawn to Kitty and Lydia, who merrily dart through the hall with unrestrained exuberance.\n\nOutside, the dark street below hums with the mirth of local men playfully mimicking the elegant dance within. One enthusiastic reveler careens into a water trough, adding a splash of merriment to the scene. Back in the ballroom, Jane and Bingley's dance draws to a close, and Bingley leads her to meet his sisters. Mrs. Bennet watches on with an approving smile as the couple take to the floor again. Bingley cuts a dashing figure in his dark tailcoat and pale satin breeches, his noble features and fair curly hair complementing Jane's delicate creamy gold gown and long white evening gloves.\n\nMeanwhile, Darcy paces through the hall, his expression set in grim forbearance. Sir William attempts to speak with him but ultimately thinks better of it. Nearby, Lizzie is engrossed in conversation with a more somber Mary. As another dance begins, Bingley allows Jane to introduce him to Charlotte Lucas, a decision that does not go unnoticed by Lizzie. With a nervous glance at his party, Bingley steps away, leaving Lizzie bristling with indignation. Having heard everything, Lizzie casts a mischievous glance at Darcy before rising and crossing the room directly in front of him, a playful smile gracing her lips. The night is young, and the dance of hearts and intentions continues to unfold in this grand spectacle of society and emotion.",

She turns to Jane, who manages a frail smile, reciprocated by Lizzie with teary eyes. As twilight descends, the hunting party returns to Netherfield Hall.\n\nLizzie, dressed in a white silk gown, shares a smile with Jane before descending a staircase, a mix of uncertainty and nervousness flickering across her face. Startled by a footman, she gratefully acknowledges him but remains disoriented. Wandering into a dark corridor, she inadvertently enters the billiard room, where Darcy is playing alone. He bows swiftly, and after a moment's hesitation, Lizzie hurriedly retreats, leaving Darcy thoughtful.\n\nLater, Lizzie is engrossed in a book in the drawing room. Darcy, after a glance at the ongoing card game, approaches her and takes a seat at a desk nearby. An exchange occurs, eyebrows are raised, and Darcy realizes Lizzie is addressing him. She smiles, and Darcy holds her in a contemplative gaze.\n\nMrs. Bennet, accompanied by Lydia and Kitty, arrives at Netherfield Hall, the girls eagerly taking in the grand facade. They are escorted in, and while Darcy departs, Mr. Bingley silences his sniggering sisters with a glare. Mrs. Bennet takes a seat, Bingley looks towards Darcy, and Lizzie closes her eyes, embarrassed.\n\nDarcy retires to his quarters, washing in a copper bath. A servant pours water over him, and he leans back, relaxing. Meanwhile, Lizzie strolls through the grounds, playfully chasing after a proud Great Dane.

Charlotte, deep in thought, advances towards the residence.\n\nInside, a flurry of activity is taking place. Mr. Collins is hastily packing his belongings. He pauses to bow before exiting, with Charlotte trailing behind him. In the drawing room, a lady is meticulously working on a delicate floral embroidery.

Lydia, Kitty, and Lizzie, dressed in their finest, navigate through the busy town. Lydia is escorted by Denny, Kitty by Carter, and Wickham seizes the opportunity to bestow a hopeful smile upon Lizzie. She returns the gesture with a radiant beam, and the two stroll through the town together. Later, Mrs. Bennet, engrossed in conversation with Denny, steps out of Longbourn. Her daughters follow suit, and Lizzie shares a subtle smile with Wickham as he acknowledges her mother with a polite nod before departing with the other officers.

The officer leads Melvin Purvis, clad in a crisp suit, into the cellblock, while other lawmen watch intently from a nearby table. Dillinger sets aside his magazine, rises, and saunters toward the bars, where the two men engage in a silent, tense exchange. Dillinger, brows furrowed, shakes his head slightly, while Purvis remains stoic, a faint smile playing on his lips. The gangster straightens up, flashes a cocky grin, and watches as Purvis departs, hands tucked in his pockets, bathed in sunlight that accentuates his clean-shaven face. Dillinger follows Purvis with his eyes as the G-man leaves with his agents, their leisurely stride barely slowing.\n\nLater, a three-propeller plane with a bulky underbelly and six skylight-like windows cruises through the sky before descending onto a rain-soaked airfield. Inside, Dillinger lurches in his seat as the plane touches down, taxies past distant hangars, and halts near a man holding a lit flare. A vast crowd and journalists await, cameras ready, as lawmen debark from a car, rifles at the ready. Trench-coated officers escort a shackled Dillinger across the tarmac, his wet bangs dangling, as flashbulbs explode around them.\n\nThe officers push Dillinger into the back seat of a Sedan adorned with a bird-winged hood ornament.

As the light turns green, Dillinger shifts the car into gear, casting a quick glance over his shoulder as he turns onto another street. His accomplice, dubbed \"Young Blood,\" keeps a vigilant watch out the rear windshield as the Ford speeds away from the town, cruising past sprawling fields. Dillinger looks at the mechanic beside him, shaking his head in light-hearted disbelief, a sentiment echoed by the confused mechanic.\n\nMeanwhile, in a stark contrast to the gangsters' escapade, J. Edgar Hoover sits in his office, listening intently to a radio broadcast. He pinches the bridge of his nose, a gesture of stress and concentration. Elsewhere, in her apartment, Billie Frechette sits anxiously, her hands fidgeting in her lap. Suddenly, she rushes to the telephone, leaning against the wall as she listens intently to the receiver. Unbeknownst to her, the call is being monitored at a telephone exchange by Agent Baum. Billie's eyes fill with sadness and resignation as she clutches the phone, resting her chin on her knuckles. Dillinger, despite his tough exterior, reveals a tender smile as he stands inside a phone booth, unaware of the surveillance closing in around him and Billie.\n\nUnderneath a bridge, two men sit in a concealed car, their eyes fixed on Billie's apartment. Later, Agent Melvin Purvis joins the stakeout, receiving a file from Baum containing a transcript of Dillinger's phone call to Billie. Behind them, an elevated traincrosses a bridge, its interior lights casting a soft glow in the dark night.\n\nAcross town, a tan car pulls up to a safe house, and Dillinger and his associate, Red, emerge. With Red providing armed cover, Dillinger cautiously rounds the corner, stepping onto an icy walkway. Sport, another of Dillinger's associates, emerges from the house, followed by Marty. Sensing danger, Dillinger narrows his eyes and brandishes his machine gun. Inside, an armed man stands ready by the doorway, while outside, Red takes aim at the house.\n\nLater, in a brazen move, Dillinger and Red storm into a cigar shop, with Red quickly apprehending two customers. Behind the counter, the shop's proprietor, Gilbert, regards the outlaws with a steely gaze. Under duress, Gilbert leads the pair upstairs to a clandestine betting operation, filled with chalkboard-covered walls, rows of men on telephones, and small overhead lights with green lampshades hanging amidst dangling clusters of phone wires. A blonde man gestures for Dillinger to raise his hands, and the notorious criminal complies, his eyes scanning the dimly lit room, unaware of the danger lurking just around the corner.",

Dillinger's head cocks to the side, while D'Andrea observes Gilbert, whose hand is poised on his gun. Turning to face Dillinger and Red, D'Andrea remains composed, perched on the edge of a desk. Dillinger holsters his weapon, his brow furrowing in thought as he locks eyes with D'Andrea. The mustached gangster leans in, but Dillinger, with a narrowed gaze, turns away and exits with Red, leaving D'Andrea with a mere shrug.\n\nMeanwhile, Hoover and Purvis traverse a hallway. Hoover diverts from Purvis, approaching a group of well-dressed boys arranged in lines. After shaking hands, Hoover addresses the press. This event is broadcast on a newsreel in a movie theatre, where Dillinger is seen conversing with a rugged gangster, acknowledging Shouse with a nod. As Dillinger's photo appears onscreen, he discreetly conceals his face. Shouse attempts to stand but is forcefully pulled back into his seat by Red, causing Homer to avert his gaze nervously. Dillinger, his face tilted down in worry, is illuminated as the overhead light brightens the audience.\n\nThe theatre patrons shift their attention right, then left, before settling back as the lights dim, signaling the start of a new story. Dillinger, deep in thought, rubs his lips and nods at Tommy. After exchanging a glance with Red, they rise, grabbing their coats. Homer, a few rows ahead, dons his hat and follows them into the aisle.\n\nExiting the theatre, Red moves closer to Dillinger. In a bustling town square, a stiff wind rustles storefront awnings. A policeman arrives on a motorcycle, drawing Baby Face's fire from within the bank. Baby Face shoots at the ceiling, causing chaos outside as Homer takes a man hostage. Inside, Dillinger and Tommy exchange a frustrated look. Dillinger tosses a bag to Tommy from the vault, guiding the bank president and a woman as hostages.\n\nShielding themselves with the hostages, the gangsters exit the bank, passing Homer who waits by their car with his captive. Baby Face fires indiscriminately into the town square, causing two men to dive for cover. A man takes aim from a window across the street. Amidst the chaos, Dillinger lurches forward, his eyes wide.

He tosses one to Baby Face, and together, they take positions at the barroom windows. Bullets rip through the air, shattering liquor bottles along the wall.\n\nUpstairs, Red and Johnny narrowly dodge gunfire from their broken windows, returning shots with fierce determination. Agent Winstead joins the fray, his bullets chipping the wall above a guest room mirror. Purvis, using a disabled car for cover, fires relentlessly at Dillinger's room, the plaster walls crumbling under the barrage. Caught in the chaos, we find ourselves huddled among the gangsters in a second-story guest room, our view jerking from one side to the other, focusing on Dillinger. Outside, FBI gunfire strafes a balcony, while a nearby window frames a gangster taking aim. The battle persists as Agent Rice takes a bullet in the leg.\n\nUnder Red's covering fire, Dillinger makes a hasty retreat to an adjacent guest room, using his gun to smash open a window. The two escape onto a rooftop, descending to a dark yard below. Back in the barroom, a shaky close-up captures Baby Face edging towards a side door. He bursts out, gun blazing towards the car, kicking up clouds of dirt. Purvis returns fire, his bullets tearing through the door. Inside, Baby Face flees past Homer, launching himself through a bay window. Agent Pleg spots the escape, prompting Purvis to glance at Baum, who immediately gives chase.\n\nPurvis resumes his gunfight with Homer, exchanging shots through the side door. Baum sprints past Agents Clegg and Madala, hot on Baby Face's trail. Meanwhile, Dillinger and Red navigate their escape through dense woods. Winstead, spotting them, signals his partner. Unnoticed, they trail the criminals, who hurriedly pick their way along a forested hillside, Red clutching a cloth sack. As Dillinger and Red pass a misty overlook, Winstead and Hurt reach a pair of trees, splitting up to gain tactical advantage.\n\nHurt climbs to higher ground while Winstead presses forward on the trail. Through the leafy canopy, the agents spot their targets. Winstead discards his hat, takes aim, and fires. Dillinger retaliates, emptying his gun as Winstead dives for cover. Kneeling, Winstead returns fire, forcing Red and Dillinger to duck behind trees. Winstead's relentless shots pound the trunk sheltering Dillinger, who calmly reloads, his breath fogging in the cold night air. With steely resolve, he leans out and fires back, the night echoing with unending gunshots.",

Boarding the vehicle, Purvis braces himself outside as they tail Baby Face. The relentless chase leads them through winding curves, with Purvis's Tommy gun barking at the stolen Ford ahead.

Navigating the drab lobby and concrete corridors, he pauses at a door, tool in hand. With a deft maneuver, he picks the lock and slips inside, his senses on high alert. The sparsely furnished living room appears unoccupied, but suddenly, an assailant lunges through glass doors, brandishing a switchblade.\n\nA brutal struggle ensues. Bond hurls the attacker into the bedroom, only for the man to retaliate with wild swings of his blade. Bond grapples for a weapon, utilizing anything within reach—a phone, scissors, a book—to counter the relentless assault. The brawl spills onto the balcony, where Bond secures a lethal grip on the man's throat. As the scissors plunge into the assailant's neck and thigh, Bond remains stoic, even as his opponent gasps his last breath.\n\nUnfazed, Bond searches the rooms, fashioning a makeshift bandage from a shirt to tend a wound on his arm.

Bond regains command, steering them through a barrage of bullets, his eyes fixed on the pursuing inflatable. Camille swiftly takes out a gunman with a well-aimed boat hook, but the inflatable circles back, relentless.\n\nThe chase is a spectacle of swerving boats and towering sprays of water.

He grasps the wheel, bracing as the other boat closes in, the chase now directed towards a crowded marina.\n\nBond eases off the throttle, and the pursuing boat crashes into them, its force driving it onto their stern, knocking Camille down. With the boats locked, Bond hurls a grappling hook, sending the inflatable reeling. He turns their boat, leaving the chaos behind, Camille now unconscious at the bottom. He navigates towards a serene inlet, rolling hills in view, aiming for a dock near a cluster of white buildings.\n\nAt the jetty, Bond lifts Camille, carrying her through throngs of elderly tourists.

Bond, now also in a tuxedo, navigates a stark white corridor and enters a room. Above, in a reception area shaped like a cube, guests mingle. Greene, exuding charm, greets an older man while his companion wanders off. Performers, including a muscular actor struggling to find his costume, ready themselves.\n\nBond surveys the scene from a balcony, spotting Greene and his friend enjoying champagne with two elegant women. Meanwhile, hostesses distribute gift bags. Bond tails a guest into the restroom and empties the bag, discovering a small Q-shaped pin and an earpiece. Greene, in his private box, does the same. The guest Bond followed is found slumped, and Bond, after pocketing the items, forcefully removes the door handle as he exits.\n\nThe opera begins dramatically, with the singer elevated on a decorator's cradle and a vast moving eye as the set backdrop. Bond ascends a series of metal stairs, reaching a high gantry overlooking the packed amphitheater. Below, Greene's anxious friend notices grim-faced men standing up and exiting throughout the auditorium. Bond captures photos of the strange occurrence before taking down an approaching intruder.\n\nReturning downstairs, Bond hears Mr. White speaking. On stage, a dungeon lid slams shut, signaling the opera's climax. Greene hastily leaves his box as Bond steps near the stage, removes his earpiece, and casually walks past where White is seated, just yards away.",
    "941": "In the bustling heart of London, a tale unfolds. Underneath the iconic skyline marked by terraced houses and chimney pots, Baker Street is a flurry of activity with underground-railway construction in progress. Dr. John Watson, a man with a distinct limp, walks along the pavement, cane in hand, leading a bulldog. A hand-knitted scarf is draped around his neck, adding a touch of warmth to his demeanor. As he opens the front door, the dog eagerly scampers upstairs, leaving Watson to navigate a room filled with tropical plants and an unexpected assortment of animals, including a turkey and a goat. Amidst this eccentric setting, Watson spots his old friend, Sherlock Holmes, motionless by the window. Suddenly, a dart hits Watson in the shoulder. Holmes, camouflaged in a two-colored garment and a brown hood, pulls off his disguise, revealing himself to a glowering Watson.\n\nHolmes leans over Watson, unveiling four mice before disappearing behind closed curtains. Watson, intrigued, opens the curtains to reveal his old office, now adorned with a map of the world, newspaper articles, photographs, and lines of red ribbon. The scene shifts to a restaurant where Holmes, with a bruised left eye and a clean but not clean-shaven appearance, sits with his back to the entrance. He hears a woman's laugh, checks his watch, and notes that it's eight minutes past nine. Irene, seated nearby, turns to face him, swallows deeply, and then staggers away, leaning on other tables for support. Holmes, coolly sipping his tea, stares ahead icily.\n\nIn a striking contrast, Holmes and Watson find themselves in a nightclub, where two girls swing upside down from a trapeze, and men throng the club, chatting and drinking. Holmes downs his drink, and Watson, in a fit of exasperation, grabs the cigar from Holmes' mouth and marches off. The narrative weaves through moments of tension and camaraderie, capturing the essence of Holmes and Watson's unique bond amidst the backdrop of a city in transition.",
    "943": "In a swift and brutal exchange, Sherlock Holmes hauls his opponent away and strikes him with a curtain rail as they struggle. Amidst the chaos, a formidable figure known as the Corsac manages to secure a line to Holmes' belt. Sim, witnessing the struggle, decisively kicks the Corsac out of the window. The taut line drags Holmes towards the window, ultimately pulling him out and sending him crashing onto a sand-laden barge in the canal below.\n\nThe Corsac, undeterred, bursts from the sand and seizes Holmes, but Holmes fights back and tumbles onto a lower deck. The Corsac attempts to escape, but Holmes, using the rope that binds them, yanks him back. A group of men seizes both Holmes and the Corsac, only to release them moments later. Seizing the opportunity, Holmes snatches a club from one of the spectators and strikes the Corsac in the face, then tugs on the rope, pulling the Corsac towards him. The Corsac, however, manages to cut the rope and begins to climb back through the window they fell from.\n\nUpstairs, Sim sees the Corsac returning and backs away. Meanwhile, one of the spectators urges Holmes on, and Holmes scales a rope hanging from a block-and-tackle on the building's side. As the Corsac re-enters the building, Dr. Watson, oblivious to the tumult, collects his gambling winnings. Holmes dramatically smashes through a window, colliding with Watson and scattering the money. As Holmes recovers, he spots the Corsac pursuing Sim on the second-floor balcony, with Sim fleeing on the first floor. The Corsac leaps down to her level, prompting Holmes to give chase.\n\nA scuffle ensues among the gamblers as they dive for the scattered money, with Watson struggling to keep his winnings. Mycroft Holmes, who had been conversing with others, breaks away from his companions. The Corsac, meanwhile, trips Sim down some steps, but she rolls and draws a knife. The Corsac dodges her attack, striking her twice before Holmes intervenes, kicking the Corsac out a door and into the canal. Sim gets to her feet, clutching her injured nose, as a slightly intoxicated Dr. Watson arrives and promptly falls over, much to Carruthers' skepticism.\n\nHolmes retrieves Sim's bag and Rene's letter, setting off the next day along a narrow road to a village. He parks outside a church and turns to a bruised and exhausted Watson, who is sleeping beside him. Sporting dark glasses and puffing on his long pipe, Holmes attempts to rouse Watson, but to no avail. He exits the vehicle, circles it, and shoves Watson again, but Watson remains stubbornly asleep.",
    "944": "In the early morning, Sherlock Holmes spots two pipers outside a church and signals for them to begin playing. Meanwhile, Dr. Watson awakens with a start, his face showing his dismay. Holmes proceeds to tug at a coat that Watson had been using as a makeshift blanket. Watson, still groggy, clings to it briefly before Holmes manages to pull it away, revealing a disheveled Watson struggling out of a car littered with empty bottles. As Holmes attempts to neaten Watson's appearance, he accidentally tears off the sleeve of Watson's jacket, which he then discards back into the car. Watson looks at Holmes with weariness, but Holmes reassures him with a nod. Together, they make their way towards the church, Watson still unsteady on his feet.\n\nInside the church, the wedding guests are already seated as the bride begins her procession up the aisle. The congregation stands, including Mrs. Hudson, who nudges a sleeping Holmes awake. Startled, Holmes rises just in time to see a cleaned-up Watson standing beside him. With a quick adjustment to Watson's tie and buttonhole, Holmes ensures Watson is presentable before he lifts the bride's veil. The bride smiles at Watson, taking in his battered appearance, complete with a black eye. She glances at Holmes, who offers a reassuring wink. Watson slips the ring onto his bride's finger, and they share a tender kiss. Holmes watches the scene thoughtfully.\n\nAs the newlywed couple exits the church, they walk beneath an arch of raised swords formed by guardsmen. Standing alone by the churchyard gate, Holmes applauds their union. Soon after, Holmes makes his way through the gate and starts his car, finding Moriarty's bearded agent leaning against it. The agent casually rolls a cigarette and steps aside, allowing Holmes to drive off in a plume of smoke.\n\nThe scene shifts to Kings College, Cambridge, where Holmes, puffing on his pipe, crosses a quadrangle and enters a building. He steps into a room filled with the soft music of a gramophone, where Professor Moriarty and another man, Matthew, are present. Moriarty turns to acknowledge Holmes as he sits at his desk to sign a book. Holmes walks behind him, examining a blackboard filled with complex calculations. He notices a book near the blackboard and a wilting plant nearby. Moriarty hands the signed book to Holmes, and they exchange a handshake. As Holmes steps back to examine the signature, Moriarty stands up, triggering a flashback in Holmes's mind to Irene Adler. Holmes recalls that Irene's tea had been poisoned and sees a bloodstained handkerchief as evidence.\n\nMoriarty sits at a chessboard, picking up the black queen. Holmes, deep in thought, takes Irene's handkerchief from the chessboard. He glares at Moriarty before turning to leave. Moriarty watches Holmes go, then refocuses on the chessboard, making a move with the black queen.\n\nLater, Watson and his new wife, Mary, are at a train station, making their way to a waiting train. Watson notices some soldiers nearby as they prepare to embark on their journey.",
    "945": "Upon entering their cabin, Watson and Mary are greeted by champagne on ice. Watson, glancing into the corridor, notices a woman conversing with the conductor. Turning his attention back to Mary, he receives a smiling handoff of a mysterious item from her. The train, enveloped in clouds of steam and smoke, races through the night. Watson and Mary engage in a passionate kiss within their compartment, but their intimate moment stops abruptly. A steward enters bearing a bottle of wine, but as he slides the door shut, the compartment is plunged into darkness. Seizing the opportunity, the steward brandishes a knife and lunges at Watson. A fierce struggle ensues between Watson and the steward, during which Mary swiftly retrieves Watson's gun and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson, seizing the advantage, opens the exterior compartment door and forcefully ejects the steward from the train. With the immediate threat neutralized, Watson takes the gun from Mary's hand, signaling for silence as he cautiously opens the door to the corridor.\n\nTo his surprise, Watson witnesses the woman—poorly disguised as Holmes—overpowering and shooting several soldiers in the corridor. As Watson holds off more soldiers, Holmes looks out the open exterior door, then shoves Watson out of the carriage as the train crosses a bridge. Returning to the compartment, Watson finds Mary gone and turns his attention back to Holmes. A struggle ensues, during which Watson rips off Holmes's blouse, revealing his identity. Soldiers burst in, one aiming a rifle at Watson.\n\nHolmes's mind races back to earlier events: applying lipstick in the corridor, he had observed soldiers readying their guns in the adjacent carriage through a grill. With swift ingenuity, Holmes had dismantled a tap from the basin, used it to open a gas valve, and decanted phosphorous into a container. Just as the train entered a tunnel, Holmes had sprinkled phosphorous dust over a soldier and replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, also shoving the lipstick case into the muzzle of a soldier's rifle.\n\nBack in the present, the soldier with the sabotaged rifle pulls the trigger, causing the gun to explode and setting fire to the phosphorous-dusted clothes of another soldier. Holmes quickly sets a booby-trap on the door, removes his skirt, and climbs out of the compartment, bare-chested. Watson follows suit, and together they precariously edge along the side of the speeding train. Meanwhile, a soldier unwittingly triggers the booby-trapped grenade upon entering Watson's compartment, adding to the escalating chaos.",
    "948": "Under the luminescent glow of a full moon, a boy cycles his bike, an unusual passenger—a dumpy alien—perched in the handlebar basket, their shadow dancing on the ground. Meanwhile, a small robot darts through tall grass beneath a cloudy sky, suddenly halting to blink, as if experiencing a moment of realization—\"Bad Robot.\" Sparks cascade within the Lillian Steel Foundry, hinting at some unseen commotion.\n\nIn a quiet residential street, a detached house stands amidst snowy surroundings. A police car sits idly in the driveway, while in the garden, 14-year-old Joe Lamb slumps on a swing, staring gloomily at a locket in his hands. Inside the house, a wake is underway; Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk watch Joe through a window, and other boys cluster around a buffet table. The crunch of tires on snow announces the arrival of a yellow Coupe from the '70s, its black vinyl roof gleaming. A handsome man with shoulder-length blonde hair steps out, glancing at Joe before striding towards the house. The man, Lewis, is swiftly escorted out by Joe's dad, Jack, who forcefully pushes him into the back of the police car and drives off, leaving Joe to watch the disappearing taillights.\n\nAs summer holidays commence, excited pupils pour out of Lillian Middle School. Joe, among them, is approached by Charles, one of the boys from the wake. Joe's shock is palpable as Charles nears. Later, a group of boys engrossed in a make-believe game sees Martin, playing a detective, draw a toy gun, only to have it knocked away by Cary, acting as a zombie. A scuffle ensues, ending with Cary dramatically impaled on wall spikes, fake blood dripping from his mouth—all under the watchful eyes of Joe and Charles. Joe departs, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk to exchange a meaningful look.\n\nCycling home on the tranquil residential street, Joe finds his father's patrol car in the driveway. Inside, he discovers his father weeping in the bathroom. Jack quickly shuts the door, leaving Joe startled. Later, at Carol's Diner, Jack and Joe sit at a table, eating. Jack passes Joe a leaflet, met with a look of skepticism. Taking a swig of his beer, Jack gazes earnestly at his son, who eventually focuses on the pamphlet, his mind churning with new thoughts and unanswered questions.",
    "953": "In a moment of slight disorientation, Jack hesitates, contemplating his response to Joe's remark. Meanwhile, Joe casts a skeptical glance at Jack before shifting his focus back to a pamphlet filled with images of enthusiastic boys enjoying a game of baseball. Jack's attention is drawn to the locket Joe holds in his left hand. The scene transitions to Joe's bedroom at 12:02 PM, where he is meticulously painting a model monster.\n\nLater, Joe and his friends convene on a grassy bank. A yellow Coupe, previously seen at the wake, pulls up outside the house. Behind the wheel is a teenage blonde girl named Alice. She turns away with a moody expression, shaking her head before glaring at Joe thoughtfully. Joe responds with a grin and offers Alice a piece of candy, delighted when she accepts it. As Alice glances at him in the rearview mirror, Joe's smile falters.\n\nThe car arrives at an isolated railway station, and the kids step out. Joe tenderly applies makeup to Alice's face using a sponge. Alice ties her hair back, allowing Joe to continue his gentle application. He pauses, uncertain, before dabbing the makeup onto her eyelids. Meanwhile, Cary's fireworks go off, and Alice's eyes fill with unshed tears, captivating Joe with her performance. Martin, playing the detective, stares intently at her. Alice breaks character, and Martin wipes away a tear.\n\nCharles dashes across the station platform, his eyes fixed on an approaching train. Panic spreads among the boys, who scramble in alarm. The camera is loaded, and as the train nears, they ready themselves to film. Joe and Preston exchange smiles, but the moment is shattered when Joe sees a pickup veer onto the tracks ahead of the train. The vehicles collide violently, knocking the camera over. The freight train plows through the station, derailing in a catastrophic wreck.\n\nAlice watches in horror as the train careens off the tracks, one car smashing through the station building, reducing it to matchwood. Electrical explosions erupt around the station, sending trucks hurtling through the air. The kids flee frantically through the debris as explosions mushroom around them. More trucks and carriages fly off the line, colliding with one another. A tanker is thrown through the air, exploding upon impact with the ground.\n\nJoe races past the flaming debris, witnessing a piece hurtle skyward before crashing down just in front of him. A warning sign catches his eye. As he turns to run, a massive explosion erupts from the debris, hurling him to the ground. He looks up, regains his footing, and surveys a carriage lying on its side, racked by a series of explosions. Clutching the locket tightly in his left hand, Joe watches as a final explosion throws a chunk of the carriage high into the air, marking the chaotic climax of the unfolding disaster.",
    "955": "As they cycle along a road, Joe casts an awkward glance downwards. Suddenly, an old yellow Coupe pulls up and out steps Louis. Joe and Alice watch him intently as he approaches, removing his shades to reveal heavy sideburns. Louis briefly steps inside the house, then promptly returns, with Alice following him back inside, leaving Joe shifting uncomfortably on the veranda. When Alice reemerges, Joe looks surprised and moves towards her.\n\nMeanwhile, a movie scene is being filmed; Martin directs the shot as zombie Cary is captured on camera, with Alice observing. The backdrop features a wrecked train, a eerie reminder of the distant crash site. Joe takes the camera and sets it up to film the far-off destruction. News crew helicopters buzz overhead, surveying the scene as the filmmakers look down at the devastation. Joe's expression is troubled as he watches Air Force personnel clearing up strange white cubes, repacking them into crates loaded onto military trucks. Among the bustle, Joe's dad, Jack, is seen with Air Force Colonel Nelec, who eventually leaves. Jack looks around, dissatisfied, and spots men carefully creating a plaster of Paris mold.\n\nLater, Jack is back at the police station, talking to Sheriff Pruitt, who leaves him looking confused. The sheriff drives into a gas station, entering the shop to find the clerk, Breen, engrossed in a new Sony Walkman. Unable to get his attention, the sheriff tosses a candy bar towards him, pays, and returns to his car. As he fills his patrol car and unwraps the candy bar, odd noises catch his attention. A pack of dogs darts across the forecourt, and suddenly, his patrol car starts acting up. On edge, the sheriff investigates, keeping a hand on his gun. A dumpster flying past startles him. Inside the shop, Breen remains oblivious, his music drowning out the chaos.\n\nSuddenly, the sheriff's car jolts violently, making the shop's lights flicker. Breen removes his headphones, looking apprehensive as he steps outside. The patrol car is wrecked, steam rising from its ruptured radiator, and the petrol pump's nozzle lies in a pool of gasoline. As Breen hears something behind him, he turns to face it, sheer terror written on his face.",

Meanwhile, Alice turns around, her eyes widening as she spots a horrifying creature lurking nearby. Louis, catching a glimpse of something in his rear view mirror, frantically tries to escape the car. He spills out of the passenger door, his body tumbling to the ground. With adrenaline fueling his movements, he sprints back up the street, only to trip over Alice's bike, his hurried steps faltering.\n\nIn a nearby scene, soldiers stand watch as one of their own wields a flamethrower, the intense heat and light casting eerie shadows. Meanwhile, Charles and Joe collect their developed film, cycling past the town's towering water tower. A ominous plume of smoke billows just outside the town, hinting at the chaos to come. Stuck on the water tower's side is a peculiar vibrating cube, an enigmatic artifact from the night's strange events.\n\nAs Charles and Joe examine their footage from the night of the crash, they find it initially obscured by clouds of smoke. Joe stands supportively beside a disheartened Charles as they continue to scrutinize the film. Suddenly, the smoke on screen clears, revealing a chilling sight: a gigantic spider-like creature emerging from a wrecked carriage. The jarring sound of a siren causes them to look around in bewilderment. Joe hastily stops the projector, tearing the film off in his haste.\n\nOutside, the streets descend into chaos as civilians and military personnel rush about in a frenzy. Joe and Charles venture down the street, their eyes drawn to a massive column of smoke looming over the town. Families, gripped by panic, hurriedly load their cars, preparing to flee. Troops direct the frantic traffic, issuing urgent instructions. Amidst the turmoil, Charles and Joe make their way to a bus, ready to evacuate.\n\nA convoy, led by military vehicles, begins to leave the town. As they make their escape, they pass military container trucks transporting mysterious white cubes, recovered from the crash site. The evacuation convoy snakes out of the town, with Charles and Joe aboard one of the buses, their faces etched with tension.\n\nAfter an arduous journey, the convoy reaches Greenville Air Force Base. Vehicles line up at the east entrance, eager to gain entry. Inside, civilians disembark from the buses, finding themselves in an enormous hangar. Air Force personnel guide the displaced townspeople, their efficient movements stark against the backdrop of confusion and fear.\n\nJoe, determined, weaves through the hangar, searching for Jack. Instead, he finds Louis lying in a sick bay, relief washing over Louis's features as he sees Joe approach. Joe later reunites with Charles, Preston, Martin, and Carrie, their faces a mix of anxiety and resilience. Meanwhile, Donnie, the camera shop employee, scans his surroundings warily.\n\nIn a sudden burst of action, an armed guard enters, escorting Donnie down a corridor. Seizing his chance, Donnie overpowers the guard, stealing his uniform and gun. Disguised, he navigates through the base, spotting a fuel tanker outside. With a calculated shot, he causes the tanker to erupt in a fiery explosion. As Air Force personnel rush to contain the blaze, Jack commandeers a Jeep, speeding off into the distance.\n\nHe races along a rugged, unpaved track, the open fields whipping past him. Finally, he pulls up near an isolated grain silo, his eyes tracking a convoy of vehicles rolling along a nearby road. The stage is set for a tense confrontation, the air thick with anticipation and danger.",
    "962": "In the dimly lit dance studio, David watches, spellbound, as Elise gracefully wraps her arms around a male dancer's neck. The dancer lifts her effortlessly, and as they spin, Elise extends her legs in a graceful arc. The dancer sets her down only to lift her again by the waist. Two other dancers join in, taking Elise's hands as the center dancer lowers and raises her in a fluid motion.\n\nBehind David, Thompson steps up, drawing David's attention away from the performance. David turns, glaring at Thompson briefly before giving him a sidelong look. Thompson, however, keeps his eyes fixed on the dancers, never acknowledging David's stare. David's brow furrows as he looks back at the stage, where a dancer tosses Elise into the arms of another. She extends her arms and legs as she is spun around.\n\nThompson begins to step away, his eyes still glued to the dancers. David watches, puzzled, as Thompson pauses in the studio's doorway, his gaze never leaving the performance. On stage, Elise bends forward, her legs sweeping straight up into the air behind her. As a male dancer tosses her, Thompson gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Elise tumbles, her face contorting in pain.\n\nDavid rushes toward the stage as a male dancer picks up Elise and swiftly carries her off. David chases after them, out of the studio. Meanwhile, Thompson turns away, his face pinched with an unreadable expression, and casually strolls through a nearby doorway.\n\nLater, Elise leans against David's shoulder as they ride in the back of a cab to the hospital. Still in her dance costume, Elise is carefully positioned on an X-ray table, a protective lead apron secured around her waist. An X-ray machine hovers above her, aligning a cross-haired light pattern with her ankle. David, meanwhile, sits in the waiting room, his head bowed and eyes closed, gently massaging the bridge of his nose.\n\nSuddenly, Thompson appears before him. In an instant, David lunges, punching Thompson squarely in the face. Thompson stumbles back, straightening his fedora as two men in the waiting room rise, their eyes fixed on David. With a stern look, Thompson turns away, tipping his hat at one of the men as he leaves. David stares after him, chest heaving, before lowering himself back into his chair, bowing his head.\n\nLater, David stands vigilantly beside Elise's bed in the emergency room, gently touching her bandaged ankle resting on two pillows.

In that same moment, a taxi collides with the stranger, sending him sprawling onto the asphalt. The cabbie slams on his brakes and rushes to the fallen man, but the stranger, seemingly unfazed, opens a mysterious book. Inside, a line traces a path across a map, moving in sync with a bus driving away from the scene. The stranger locks onto this and takes off after the bus, his eyes glued to the pulsing red dot on the map.\n\nMeanwhile, on the bus, the lovely woman, now revealed as Elise, attemptsv to tip David's coffee cup, grabs his phone mid-ring, and mischievously drops it into his coffee, causing it to bubble furiously.

Meanwhile, Daisy is seen strolling through the snowy streets of Moscow with a young man, later lying in bed with him. Back in the present, Benjamin, clad in a brown leather jacket and dark glasses, cruises down a tree-lined road on a cherry red motorcycle. He is seen stripping paint from the porch of a retirement home, dressed in white overalls and a cap, descending a stepladder with a sober nod. His journey continues, the memories of Daisy lingering in the air like the fading scent of a bouquet.",
    "979": "In the quietude of a morning, a postman arrives, delivering a telegram to Benjamin, who stands on his front porch, tearing open the missive as the postman departs. The scene shifts abruptly, as the clouds part to reveal the sprawling magnificence of Paris from above. The Arc de Triomphe stands majestically at the heart of the Place de l'Etoile, with twelve roads radiating outward, pulsating with the city's relentless energy.\n\nBenjamin's journey unfolds as he exits a taxi and traverses a grassy courtyard with purpose. Ascending a flight of stairs, he approaches a nurse seated at a reception desk. After a brief exchange, he takes a seat opposite her as she places a call. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her apartment, hailing a black cab that promptly pulls away with a new passenger as she turns to secure her door. Simultaneously, Daisy sits on a stage, her legs swinging nonchalantly.\n\nThe tranquility is shattered when a cab brakes harshly, jolting Benjamin upright. Elsewhere, Daisy combs her hair, unaware of the impending turmoil. Back at the hospital, the nurse concludes her call, and Benjamin rises, venturing into a ward filled with bed-bound patients. In a sudden, jarring moment, he collides with someone. Regaining his composure, he approaches a hospital bed where a woman lies with a bruised face and an elevated right leg encased in a metal frame.\n\nHer eyes flutter open, but his image is a blur. Benjamin takes a seat, offering a warm smile despite his youthful, fresh-faced appearance. His initial warmth dissipates as his face falls, and she hides hers in response. He looks at her intently as she struggles to hold back tears. Benjamin's gaze drops to the floor before returning to Daisy, who has turned her head away, eyes closed. A heavy moment passes before she turns back to find him gone, leaving only a swaying triangular support above her. She grasps it sharply, her emotions raw and palpable.\n\nCaroline, elsewhere, continues to read, her expression harrowed. Benjamin walks the streets, pausing at a corner to stare upward before moving away from an apartment block. Caroline leaps up, her aged mother's unnaturally bent wrist a silent testimony to their shared burden. Caroline sits back, picking up a diary as Benjamin sails on a calm lake, his past a whirlwind of departures and silent encounters.\n\nA dark-haired young woman rushes out of Benjamin's bedroom, freezing at the sight of an elderly resident staring at their rooms. Benjamin, fresh-faced with short cropped hair and a bright white T-shirt, stares wistfully before moving to his window. He alights from his sailboat, strolling casually on a wooden jetty, and later drives a blue motorbike parked outside. Queenie watches from a high window as he crosses the lawn, past a man raking dead leaves. Removing his cap, Benjamin glances up at Queenie, striding towards the main building where he was left as a baby.\n\nPausing on the porch, he turns to see Daisy standing in the opposing doorway, dressed in black, her hands knitted together at her waist. Their eyes meet, and the circle of their journey seems to close, if only for a moment.",
    "981": "In the opening moments, Benjamin and Daisy arrive at their destination and set down their bags. Benjamin curiously looks into the kitchen and then down the narrow staircase leading to Queenie's basement bedroom. Daisy observes him as he walks to the bottom of the stairs. Suddenly, an elderly woman materializes on the landing above.\n\nThe scene shifts to a quaint white church filled with a predominantly black congregation gathered for a funeral. Queenie's daughter sits prominently, draped in a black veil, with a man in a suit beside her, nodding solemnly. Daisy and Benjamin take their seats at the end of the pew nearest the wall, witnessing the open displays of grief from the mourners. At the front, Queenie lies in an open casket. The man from earlier shakes Benjamin’s hand in passing, while Daisy lowers her gaze, contrasting Benjamin's serene demeanor. As the service concludes, people begin to rise from the pews, revealing a framed family photograph hanging on the wall.\n\nLater, inside a house, Daisy turns on a bathroom tap, but no water flows. She quickly wraps herself in a bed sheet and rushes into the bathroom, while Benjamin receives a delivery at the fridge freezer. Now fully dressed, they work together to decorate the house. Playfully, Benjamin paints Daisy's behind with a pink roller, prompting her to chase him with a brush.\n\nAs night falls, the couple engaged in a playful dance on the mattress in their lamp-lit bedroom. Benjamin removes his T-shirt, and they share a passionate kiss, leading to Benjamin lying on top of Daisy. Post their intimate moment, Benjamin hangs a picture and makes popcorn while they watch The Beatles perform on a black and white television.\n\nIn another scene, a woman performs physiotherapy on Daisy's leg. At the swimming pool, Daisy watches as another young woman dives gracefully into the water and executes a flawless front crawl. Benjamin, dressed in a white shirt, appears poolside, observing the scene. As the swimmer emerges effortlessly from the pool, Daisy’s gaze follows her with a tinge of sadness. Overwhelmed, Daisy rests her arms on the poolside, her head lulled in the crook of her arm, sobbing quietly. Day breaks, casting a warm light through the tall windows as Benjamin walks calmly to the pool's edge.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, Daisy, wearing a headscarf, rides on the back of Benjamin's motorcycle as they journey down a winding road under a gloomy sky crackling with lightning. Upon stopping, Benjamin, wrapped in a patchwork blanket and carrying two mugs, walks up from behind the parked motorbike. He continues past the lake house to the boardwalk, where Daisy sits staring at the derelict jetty stretching out to the lake. He hands her a drink and takes a seat beside her, the two of them bathed in the warm glow of the rising sun.\n\nNext, Daisy moves gracefully through a dance studio as young girls file out. She locks up the studio and places her keys by a desk, standing alone in the room with tall mirrors lining the walls opposite the front windows. She strolls across the varnished wooden floor, regarding her reflection as she poses with one arm elevated, lost in thought and reflection.",
    "982": "Benjamin, his hands tucked into his pockets, watches intently as Daisy struggles to turn, her bad leg shaking slightly. She steadies herself, stretching her leg tight before grasping a wall-mounted ballet bar, lifting her right leg high behind her. Benjamin steps close, wrapping an arm around her as they share a moment in the mirror. Daisy turns to him, her initial smile fading as she studies his reflection seriously. He removes his arm, looking directly into her searching eyes, and offers a reassuring smile. Overwhelmed, she embraces him tightly.\n\nLater, they sit side by side on a tram, Daisy smiling as Benjamin gazes distantly out of the window, lost in thought. He snaps back to reality, meeting Daisy's fond smile, but his attention is drawn to a man seated with his young daughter nearby. Daisy, noticing his drift, wraps an arm around Benjamin and plants a soft kiss on his cheek.\n\nAs night falls, they find themselves in a diner, seated across from each other. Daisy finishes an ice cream sundae, brushing a crumb from her swollen belly. Benjamin leans back, allowing her to take his hand, but his smile is unconvincing. She tries to reassure him, kissing his hand, before excusing herself to the restroom, draped in an autumnal poncho. Benjamin settles the bill, his eyes drawn to a television in the corner where Elizabeth’s grinning face appears on the screen. Upon Daisy's return, they leave the diner, but Benjamin stops abruptly in the lounge, his eyes fixed on Daisy at the bottom of the stairs, bleeding.\n\nPanicked, Benjamin rushes to the phone before darting down the basement stairs. He finds Daisy sprawled on the bloodstained floor beside a wash basket. Alone in the kitchen, Benjamin paces anxiously, peering out into the corridor. His worry escalates as he leans on a kitchen surface, his eyes doe-eyed. A uniformed man and a female doctor emerge from the bedroom through separate doors. Benjamin enters to find Daisy with their newborn baby. He sits on the bed, and together they gaze at their daughter, wrapped snugly in a blanket. Daisy soothes the infant with her little finger, looking back at Benjamin through teary eyes. He caresses his daughter tenderly.\n\nIn the hospital, Caroline turns to her mother, Daisy, sharing a meaningful look. Putting down a diary, Caroline leaves Daisy's bedside, her brow furrowed and face gaunt. Daisy watches as Caroline wanders into the corridor. The clock by the wall-mounted TV reads 9:55. Caroline lights a cigarette, catching the attention of a nurse eating an apple. The TV weatherman's voice drones in the background. Daisy taps a fist on the bedside table, prompting Caroline to pick up the diary and read aloud by the window.",
    "975": "In the opening scenes, a cascade of colored buttons tumbles down, forming the iconic Warner Brothers' shield, setting the stage for the story to unfold. The focus then shifts to a gaunt, elderly woman named Daisy, her weary, sunken eyes fluttering open briefly before closing again. She lies frail and tired in a hospital bed, her head wrapped in a tight turban. Her daughter, Caroline, in her thirties, approaches her bedside, clasping her hand with a mix of concern and tenderness. Daisy, in her discomfort, had been scratching her chest, prompting a nurse to adjust her IV drip. Caroline, her dark hair framing her thoughtful face, looks away pensively before taking Daisy's hand again, hugging her gently, and stroking her arm. Daisy's eyes open slightly, her brow furrowing as she seems to recall a memory.\n\nA flashback ensues, revealing a grand train station with an impressive colonnade. A watchsmith, bald with a mustache and dark glasses, is seen with his family, sending their son off at the station. The scene shifts to Mrs. Gateau, Daisy, opening a letter at the dining table, exchanging a glance with her husband before he leaves the table. They stand on a platform as uniformed men unload a somber line of coffins from a steam train, a grim echo of the war's toll. Later, Mr. Gateau is seen fitting a large brass cog, as a crowd watches him unveil a massive, embossed, brass clock at the train station. In a surreal sequence, the clock's second hand begins to turn backwards, and scenes of war reverse: a fallen soldier rises and runs backwards from an explosion, soldiers retreat over muddy fields, and their son returns on the reversing train. President Roosevelt, watching solemnly, hangs his head before looking up again.\n\nThe flashback deepens, showing grainy footage of Mr. Gateau rowing out to sea in a wooden boat, a poignant image of solitude and departure. Back in the hospital room, the nurse leaves, and Caroline, pale and thoughtful, discovers Daisy's suitcase hidden under a sofa. Inside, she finds a leather-bound book containing a black-and-white wedding photo, hinting at a story waiting to be told.\n\nThe narrative then jumps back in time to a vibrant street scene filled with fireworks and revelers waving American flags. Thomas Button, in his forties, sprints through the crowd to a house where his wife lies in a large bed, sheets stained with blood. A doctor and a priest are present, the atmosphere tense and urgent. Thomas nods to the priest, who begins to give the last rites, as Thomas approaches the baby's cot with a mix of caution and anticipation, marking a pivotal moment in his life. The story is set to unfold, weaving together the threads of past and present, love and loss, in a tapestry of human experience.",
    "986": "In a modestly furnished basement room, Queenie directs the baby's gaze towards an elderly woman, causing the infant to chuckle warmly. Suddenly, Tizzy arrives, drawing Queenie's stern glance from her bed, her white nightdress stark against the dim surroundings. Tizzy removes his suit jacket, his eyes fixed on Benjamin, who lies in a makeshift cot—a drawer beside Queenie's bed. Queenie's glare intensifies as Tizzy sits on the bed, prompting him to avert his gaze. He starts to leave, pausing only to remove his spectacles and place them on the dresser before returning to sit close to Queenie. The tension between them dissolves as they embrace, their eyes locked, and Queenie leans in to kiss him tenderly. They sink onto the bed, Tizzy's hand cupping Queenie's neck as their kiss deepens.\n\nYears pass, and Benjamin, now a child, bears an uncanny resemblance to a bald, elderly man. He sits at a dining table, using an ear trumpet, his round glasses perched on his nose and wisps of white hair framing his shiny, bald head. Confined to a wheelchair, Benjamin propels himself along a porch, his journey halted by an elderly resident's walking stick lodged between his spokes. Undeterred, Benjamin continues to the top of the front steps, where he watches children playing in the street. His wheelchair inches closer to the edge, the drop growing steeper with each movement.\n\nTime shifts again, and Benjamin is seen lying beside Queenie, clasping her hand as Tizzy enters the room. Later, Tizzy carries a frail, child-sized Benjamin up the stairs, depositing him in his wheelchair in an empty, wood-paneled lounge. An elderly woman slumbers in the corner as Benjamin wheels himself to the glass-paned double doors, standing to peer out, his breath fogging the glass. Suddenly, his legs buckle, and he crumples to the ground. Outside, an elderly man raises a flag up a flagpole in the pouring rain, while a white-haired old woman with scarlet lipstick observes from nearby.\n\nIn the intimacy of their home, Queenie bathes Benjamin with the bathroom door wide open, attempting to straighten his stiff right leg as Tizzy washes up nearby. A large marquee has been erected, and within it, Benjamin dozes in a wicker-backed wheelchair. Queenie wakes him, rising elegantly to her feet as women in white uniforms and nurses' hats approach. A preacher in a suit stands nearby, and Queenie, dressed in a pale orange dress, places her purse beside Benjamin. She whispers something to the bespectacled preacher, who places a comforting arm around her, addressing the congregation. In a peculiar gesture, the mustachioed preacher places a hand on Queenie's belly before guiding her into the arms of the nurses. Queenie steadies herself, and the preacher removes Benjamin's boater, gazing intently at the peculiar child.",
    "994": "In the opening sequence, Nick grins as Gatsby ascends the steps to the grand mansion, leaving Nick to walk away. However, Nick pauses and turns back to Gatsby, who acknowledges him with a nod. Nick responds with a thoughtful smile before finally turning to leave. Meanwhile, Gatsby continues up the grand staircase, stopping at the top to gaze thoughtfully at the mansion. Flanked by servants, he enters the house.\n\nThe scene shifts to Nick in his doctor's office, sitting at a typewriter, as a female staff member brings him breakfast. Elsewhere, photographers swarm around a car, their curiosity piqued. Inside the mansion, Gatsby and Daisy share intimate moments, lying together in the dark as curtains billow from open windows. Outside, photographers maintain their vigil, staking out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy eventually rise from their repose, standing at the dock's end, gazing across the bay. Gatsby notices Herzog nearby, and Nick appears unsure of the situation. When Gatsby looks again, Herzog is seen lurking in the shadows before turning and walking off, leaving Nick lost in thought.\n\nMeanwhile, Tom lights a cigar as Gatsby and Daisy appear apprehensive, attended by servants. At the Buchanan's, a tense gathering unfolds around the dining table, with Tom pacing and Gatsby frowning heavily. Tom glances at Gatsby, who points at something, causing Daisy to look increasingly nervous. Gatsby rises, and Tom looks out, squinting at the green light flashing atop wooden posts. Gatsby reaches for Daisy's hand on the white tablecloth, but she pulls away abruptly. Attempting to light a cigarette, Daisy fumbles and drops the lighter. Gatsby retrieves it, lighting the cigarette as Daisy cups her hand around his. They share an earnest look, Daisy's eyes brimming with tears, as Tom steps closer, glowering. Nick listens intently while Tom stubs out his cigar. Daisy then marches off down the hall, Jordan following closely behind. Tom looks at Gatsby briefly before walking off himself.\n\nIn the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg and Tom's smaller blue coupe are brought around. Tom drives ahead recklessly with Nick and Jordan beside him, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others. Ahead, a truck has spilled its load of fruit and vegetable crates. Tom veers around, squashing watermelons, and nearly hits an oncoming car. They continue to the grim Valley of Ashes, overlooked by the oculist's unnerving sign. Their destination is Wilson's garage, where Wilson looks ill, and Myrtle watches from an upstairs window. The stage is set for the upcoming drama.",
    "995": "In the throes of a heated drama, Tom spots Daisy, sparking a chain of events that will change everything. Gatsby, ever the man of action, approaches Tom, causing him to panic. In a desperate attempt to escape, Tom throws money at Wilson and speeds off, hot on the trail of Gatsby and Daisy, who are already ahead. From her upstairs window, a desperate and tearful Myrtle watches the scene unfold.\n\nGatsby and Tom race along a filthy road, littered with heaps of trash and coal waste, their destination unknown. They cross the Queensboro Bridge side-by-side, the tension between them palpable. Gatsby, ever the competitor, glances at Tom and presses his foot down on the accelerator, edging his coupe ahead. Daisy, seemingly unfazed by the drama, grins and waves exuberantly as they pass a train and head into New York City.\n\nIn a plush suite at the Plaza Hotel, the scene is set for a showdown. Tom watches intently as an employee chips away at a large block of ice with an ice pick. The windows are wide open, and several fans whir, offering little respite from the oppressive heat. Sweat glows on their faces as they sit around, drinking whiskey. The ice, now chipped, is placed on a tray, and Tom presses a piece against the back of his neck, seeking relief.\n\nNick and Jordan watch the exchange closely, their discomfort growing. Gatsby, standing across the room from Tom, frowns and nods at his rival. The tension in the room is thick. Gatsby, unable to bear the suspense, takes a sip of whiskey and moves to stand at a window, his back to the room.\n\nTom, with his back to Gatsby, takes Daisy's hand, a silent declaration of possession. Gatsby turns to face Tom, his eyes burning with unspoken words. Tom, silently seething, turns to face Gatsby, his glower intensifying. Daisy, caught in the middle, sits down, tears filling her eyes. She shakes her head, overcome with emotion.\n\nTom, unnerved by the scene, points at Nick. Gatsby, fueled by anger and desperation, looms over Tom, holding him by his shirt collar, his fist raised. For a moment, their foreheads rest against each other, a silent battle of wills. Tom grins, as if he's won some kind of game, while Daisy and Jordan hold their hands over their faces fearfully.\n\nGatsby, shocked and chest heaving, steps away from Tom. Daisy stares at Gatsby, tears brimming in her eyes. He goes to her, and the tears flood from her eyes. Tom, nonchalant, looks at his watch. Gatsby, unable to bear the scene any longer, runs out, knocking over a lamp in his haste.\n\nTom pushes the door shut, the phone book falling to the floor. He takes a slug of whiskey, unwrapping another bottle as Nick, frowning heavily, moves to look out of a window. Tom, avoiding Nick's gaze, glances away. Nick, drawn back to the drama, turns from the window, only to return his gaze moments later.\n\nAcross the Queensboro Bridge, a tragedy unfolds. Myrtle, her forehead cut, is assaulted by Wilson, who shakes the poles around her neck. She hits him and runs, desperate to escape. The bright yellow Deusenberg thunders through the Valley of Ashes, and seeing the car, Myrtle runs into the road.\n\nAnother car approaches, and Gatsby, gripping the wheel of the Deusenberg, tries to swerve. But it's too late. The Deusenberg hits Myrtle, and she rolls up the bonnet, hits the windscreen, and is thrown into the air, her life extinguished in an instant. The drama, it seems, has reached a horrifying climax, leaving the lives of all involved forever changed.",
    "997": "In the opening moments, Nick's face clouds with confusion, his brow furrowing in perplexity. He retreats to the shadows of his cottage, lost in thought. His gaze shifts to Gatsby's mansion, where a yellow Duesenberg draws up. Compelled, Nick approaches and discovers Gatsby scrubbing blood from the car's damaged front—a grim testament to its fatal encounter with Myrtle. The vehicle's right fender is dented, the windscreen cracked. Gatsby, kneeling with a rag and bucket, pauses and looks around before they both conceal the car from view. Spotting Herzog, Gatsby dispatches him into the house with a pointed look. With a sharp nod and a sweeping gesture, Gatsby leads them into the house, but not before a final, skyward glance. Nick, wearing a cautious frown, follows.\n\nAs dawn breaks, they stand on the dock, Gatsby's gaze fixed on the bay. Meanwhile, at the garage, Wilson tosses Myrtle's pills into a drawer, takes up a revolver, and stares blankly at the Dr. Eckleburg billboard. The sun ascends, casting a golden glow over the calm bay. Gatsby and Nick retreat to the terrace, then venture down to the pool, Gatsby leading the way through tall, stone urns and descending steps. Nick pauses at the top as Gatsby turns and smiles. Nick returns the smile, his expression thoughtful, then continues along the gravel path, leaving Gatsby resting on a low, metal gate. They exchange waves and smiles before Nick sits, a sleepy spectator to the activities around him.\n\nGatsby, now poolside, dives into the round, azure pool. Elsewhere, Daisy sits listlessly near a telephone, her complexion pale. Gatsby surfaces as his phone echoes, a faint, hopeful smile playing on his lips. He ascends the pool steps, eyes drawn to the Buchanan mansion across the bay. Herzog takes the call, but before Gatsby can react, Wilson advances from the shadows, revolver in hand. A shot rings out, Gatsby's body jerking from the impact. Herzog turns, startled, as Gatsby touches his chest, examining the blood on his fingertips. His deep blue eyes widen, stare wild and unseeing across the Bay of Consequence. Then, his mouth agape, Gatsby's eyes glaze over, his eyelids droop, and his life ebbs away.",
    "999": "High atop a skyscraper, a workman pounds away at a steel girder, sending sparks flying. Meanwhile, Nick awakens, clad only in his underwear, curled up on the porch swing outside his modest cottage. Unbeknownst to him, Gatsby observes from a window. Soon after, Nick receives a personal invitation to what promises to be a grand event.\n\nAs night falls, Gatsby's colossal mansion is illuminated, its grandeur on full display. Out front, a fountain bubbles while cars packed with eager partygoers stream in. Nick, clutching his invitation, is swept up in the throng surging towards the mansion's cavernous ballroom. Inside, a spectacle unfolds: a spotlit dancer twirls enormous multicolored feathers under a glittering, dome-shaped crystal chandelier. A massive pipe organ played by a man hanging upside-down from the ceiling accompanies the revelry. At the ballroom's center, a flood-lit blue pool beckons.\n\nNick, dressed sharply in beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie, wanders through the festivities, smiling and taking it all in. He pauses to chat with a bartender and downs a martini in one swift gulp. Nearby, two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses do the Charleston with a man on a podium, while an alluring young woman glides through the crowd. Nick turns to Jordan, who removes her hat as Gilda, resplendent in a cream flapper dress adorned with tiers of tassels, shimmies across the dance floor. Gilda's moves are frenetic; her tassels swish and sway as she spins and kicks, and soon the dance floor is filled with eager participants.\n\nAscending the stairs with Jordan, Nick finds himself in a library after a playful tussle. An elderly gentleman descends from a set of library steps, offering them drinks. From their vantage point, they gaze down at the pulsating party below, revelers jumping into the pool and dancing wildly as colorful confetti rains down and the band, adorned in red fezzes, plays on.\n\nRejoining the throng, Nick interrupts Jordan's dance with Teddy Barton, a chiseled young man with slicked hair. They take to a circular platform over the pool, shimmying together as glittering strings fly through the air. Teddy attempts to reclaim Jordan's attention, but she turns back to Nick, leaving him looking miffed. It's then that Nick comes face-to-face with Gatsby—a handsome, fine-featured man with bright eyes and swept-back, wavy brown hair. Gatsby greets them warmly, kissing Jordan's hand and squeezing Nick's shoulder before nodding and departing.\n\nFireworks suddenly light up the sky, and in the commotion, an older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, leaves Jordan looking bewildered. From his perch at the top of the stairs, Gatsby watches the scene unfold before walking away, leaving Nick and Jordan amidst the opulent chaos.",
    "1000": "In search of the enigmatic Gatsby, Jordan casts a bemused glance at Nick before venturing through the vibrant party scene, leaving Nick stood in contemplation, his back turned to the captivating firework display that held the rest of the crowd enthralled. From his upstairs window, Gatsby watched the sparkling spectacle, the reflections dancing across the glass. The night sky was alight with a thousand silver stars bursting forth in radiant explosions. Jordan, elegantly navigating the confetti-strewn dance floor, ascended the stairs and disappeared through the double doors at the top, all while Nick watched, frowning, his back still turned to the dazzling fireworks.\n\nGatsby, standing at the window, wore a benign smile and held a cigarette between his fingers. Nick, finally drawn to the spectacle, turned to admire the display as twinkling specks of light descended like snowflakes. A giant champagne bottle released a cascade of shimmering golden flakes that floated down upon the guests reclining in a cushioned lounge. Amidst this opulence, Nick lay back, a dreamy expression on his face as he gazed up at the photos and paintings adorning the walls. A barman began clearing up the remnants of the festivities, prompting Nick to stand and survey the scene thoughtfully. A woman draped herself across the piano, adding a touch of decadence to the atmosphere.\n\nJordan reappeared, this time with Teddy in tow, and the two were swiftly driven away. Gatsby, watching from the top of the steps, pressed his lips together thoughtfully before offering a polite smile and retreating. The fountain became a lively gathering spot as people cavorted nearby, while Jordan, standing in the car, waved as she was driven past. Nick, smiling, returned the wave and then walked along the dimly lit driveway to his cottage. Pausing, he looked back at Gatsby's mansion, where Gatsby, framed by a painting of charging stags, lowered a telephone and waved. Nick waved back, and Gatsby, smiling charmingly, watched as Nick continued on his way. However, as Nick turned his back, Gatsby's smile faded, and he lifted the telephone to his ear once more.\n\nInside his cottage, Nick sat reading, only to be interrupted by the sound of an engine. Frowning, he got up and looked out the window to see Gatsby circling the cottage in a bright-yellow Duesenberg coupe. The open-topped car, adorned with white-wall tires and four chrome side pipes curling down from the engine, was a sight to behold. Nick emerged, tightening his dressing gown, and nervously took the passenger seat. Gatsby, with a smile, patted his leg and drove the Duesenberg at high speed along a country road, weaving in and out of traffic with breathtaking agility.\n\nAs they sped along, Gatsby overtook other cars and cornered sharply, narrowly avoiding a pedestrian. When a motorcycle cop pulled alongside them, Gatsby merely held up his business card, prompting the cop to peel off to the right. Gatsby's smile widened as they headed towards the Queensboro Bridge, where they drove alongside a convertible. The convertible, driven by a white chauffeur, carried two black couples in the back, all enjoying champagne. Nick looked on, bemused, as they entered a barber shop where a distinguished man with gray hair, beard, and mustache sat waiting. Gatsby, with a purposeful air, tapped a wall inside the shop.",
    "1004": "In the grandeur of his home, Gatsby becomes aware of Nick's gaze and quickly composes himself. The melody of the organ brings a smile to Gatsby's face, and he gestures towards the ballroom, where Nick and Daisy exchange smiles. The organ is played by Klipspringer, a young man with wild hair and glasses. Gatsby leans back on cushions, watching as Nick and Daisy dance in the candlelit ballroom. Daisy spins to face Nick, and they shimmy in sync. Gatsby's expression turns grave as he reminisces about a past moment in uniform, dancing and kissing Daisy, followed by memories of battle.\n\nRain cascades onto the terrace and the dock stretching into the bay, while across the water, a green light pulses gently through the mist. Klipspringer dozes on the organ keys, and Nick sits on the stairs, drink in hand. Daisy and Gatsby share a slow dance, their intimate moment observed by Nick, who wears a serious expression. Gatsby kisses Daisy, resting his cheek against hers.\n\nIn a stark contrast, one of Gatsby's extravagant parties is in full swing. Guests in lavish attire indulge in drinks, dance, and frolic in the ornamental pool. Gatsby maintains a polite smile as he, Daisy, Tom, and Nick navigate through the crowded party. Gatsby escorts Daisy by the arm, while Tom accompanies Nick. They eventually settle at tables on a raised platform, overlooking the festivities. Gatsby smiles, but Tom appears bored and slightly bemused by the spectacle.\n\nThe butler, Herzog, discreetly informs Gatsby of the arrival of Mr. Slagle, a stern-faced man in a sharp suit, accompanied by his associates. As the band plays, Gatsby and Tom exchange a courteous smile. Gatsby rises and gestures towards the dance floor. Daisy looks around before Gatsby takes her arm, leading her to dance. Meanwhile, Tom's attention is drawn to the captivating actress Marlene Moon. He acknowledges her with a raised eyebrow and a nod, then watches Gatsby and Daisy dance, as does Nick.\n\nTom, noticing Marlene's expectant gaze, joins her and glances back at Nick, who halfheartedly raises his glass and returns his focus to the dancing couples. Gatsby whispers to Daisy and guides her through the crowd, with Nick watching, frowning. Outside, Gatsby follows Daisy through a gate and across the terrace, nodding to servants along the way. Nick, now outside, stands by a drink table adorned with a cocktail fountain, observing the scene unfold.",

The artist, Crawford, continues his meticulous work as the Queen, adorned in a white embroidered dress and black velvet cloak bearing the star and shield of St. George's Cross, maintains a nearly unchanging expression despite turning her head. The grandeur of the palace is underscored by the solitary figure of a piper walking along the lengthy colonnade, with the royal standard flag gently swaying in the breeze overhead.\n\nThe scene transitions to the Queen's private chambers, where she lies in bed in a darkened room. A woman enters, depositing a newspaper on the bedside table, which captures the Queen's attention. Soon after, the Queen is seated at her desk, accompanied by her beloved corgis, when Robin enters the room.\n\nMeanwhile, a black Jaguar draws to a halt in the palace courtyard. A man in formal attire opens the rear door to reveal Tony and Cherie Blair within. They are escorted through an opulent hall by a man in naval uniform, who leads them to a pair of imposing closed doors. Cherie takes a seat nearby as Tony is brought into the room, where he and the equerry bow to the Queen, standing regally in the center. Tony shakes the Queen's hand and waits for her to be seated before taking his own seat opposite her. Cherie and the equerry stand from their chairs outside and enter the room, with Cherie curtsying before the Queen, who acknowledges her with a warm smile and a handshake.\n\nAs the audience concludes, Tony and Cherie retreat awkwardly from the room, the Queen observing their departure closely. Upon exiting, they share smiles with the palace staff. The narrative then shifts to a series of images and footage: Diana and Dodi relaxing together, Diana seated alone on a diving board, and her boarding a small jet plane. The media frenzy surrounding her is depicted by numerous reporters gathered in front of a hotel and a group of men on motorbikes waiting by the back door, emphasizing the intense public scrutiny she faced.",

The Queen takes the necklace, gazes into a full-length mirror, and secures it around her neck, her reflection holding her attention for a moment. She then descends the stairs, her expression troubled, and encounters Prince Philip emerging from a nearby room. Without pausing, she hastens into the courtyard, dons a head scarf, and climbs into the driver's seat of a waiting Land Rover. The vehicle promptly pulls away, with three bodyguards swiftly following in another car.\n\nElsewhere, Alastair abruptly enters Tony's office but quickly leaves, drawing a curious glance from Tony.

The Mayor steps up to the lectern as Spanish flags wave in the background. Enrique rubs his palms together, his mind consumed with thoughts of Veronica's assignation and the young man leaving her. Suddenly, the Mayor finishes his introduction, and President Ashton steps forward, raising his arms wide. Without warning, the President staggers back and falls.\n\nEnrique jumps onto the podium and runs across it, only to be tackled by Barnes. Matthews and Holden quickly lead Enrique away, all while a man in a checked shirt films the chaotic scene. Amidst the commotion, Enrique spots Veronica striding through the crowd, watching her intently as she catches sight of him. Their gazes lock, and Enrique's eyes move down to the bag he brought through security for her. Veronica tosses it under the podium just as an agent begins to lead Enrique away.\n\nBreaking free, Enrique elbows the agent in the face and seizes his gun. Smoke quickly fills the plaza, and as Enrique sits up, Holden, beside the fallen Matthews and Barnes, glances over and sees him. Enrique holsters the agent's gun, prompting Holden to give chase. Rounding a corner with Holden and another agent, Parsons, in pursuit, Holden fires a shot into the air.\n\nEnrique rushes out into the street, darting into the road as an ambulance approaches. Veronica sits in the passenger seat, and Enrique stands gaping, only to be hit by a car. Undeterred, he gets to his feet and runs, with Holden and Parsons chasing him into an arcade. Enrique shoves people out of his way, sprinting upstairs and into an apartment building. Residents on the staircase delay the secret service agents, giving Enrique a chance to run onto a balcony and leap from it into a courtyard.\n\nHolden and Parsons reach the balcony railing and race along it, but Enrique has already dashed away from the building and is sprinting along the street, constantly looking behind. Dodging traffic, he crosses the road until he is hit by another car. Despite the impact, he runs across a road to an underpass carrying highway traffic, his escape desperate and relentless.",
    "1044": "In the heart of the day, the historic Plaza Mayor is abuzz with a restless crowd, the drone of a helicopter echoing overhead. Among the throng is Howard Lewis, clad in a checked shirt, his camera pointed at the upper windows and arches of the plaza, capturing the enthusiastic shouts of children from nearby balconies. His LCD screen displays a timer nearing two hours and two minutes as he meanders through the crowd, camera aloft.\n\nHoward's lens finds a couple by a pillar: Veronica and a young man. Zooming in, he witnesses Veronica slip something into the man's hand, her fingers lingering on his palm. As they lean in closer, Howard averts his gaze, briefly stopping his recording. Resuming, his camera catches a small man approaching and a little girl brushing past him with her ice cream. The girl, Anna, is swiftly whisked away by her mother, leaving Howard with only a backswept glance from the child.\n\nDrawn by a wave of applause, Howard refocuses on the podium where President Ashton greets the Mayor. He inches closer, his eyes glued to the LCD screen, grinning as he captures Barnes, a security agent, looking upward and speaking into his sleeve. Howard's camera catches a moving curtain, a shadowy figure behind it. As he fixates on the mysterious form, a shot rings out—the President is hit.\n\nPandemonium erupts. Holden and Matthews, secret service agents, rush to the President's side as the crowd recoils from the podium. Howard swivels back to the now-open window, then to the podium, where Enrique, the young man from earlier, leaps onto the stage. Barnes tackles Enrique, but Howard keeps recording, even as Veronica discards her bag under the podium and flees.\n\nThe crowd's unease grows as a distant explosion booms. Anna, the little girl from earlier, loses her mother's hand in the chaos. Panic sweeps through the plaza, people trampling the fallen as they flee. Amidst the turmoil, Howard pulls out his cell phone, his camera still rolling, documenting the bedlam unfolding before him.\n\nEarlier, before the plaza erupted into chaos, Enrique was not merely a spectator but a catalyst. Drenched in sweat, he had stepped out from behind a pillar, gun in hand, his eyes scanning the road with a fierce glare. But the clock had not yet struck noon; time was not yet ripe for the catastrophe that would soon engulf them all. Rewinding further, Enrique's day had begun with a jolt—literally; he was hit by a car. Veronica was there, in an ambulance. Holden aimed his gun at Enrique, an explosion sounded, and Barnes, along with Veronica's companion, tackled him. The clock had struck twelve, setting the stage for the mayhem that Howard would later capture on tape.\n\nNow, as Enrique steps out from behind the pillar, his heart hammers, and his grip tightens on the cocked gun, slick with sweat. His eyes harden as he surveys the road, steeling himself for the storm about to break.",
    "1046": "In a burst of action, Holden and Parson initiate a shootout from across the highway, sending Howard fleeing. The camera zooms back in on Enrique, who lies motionless. An officer leans over Enrique's body, carefully lifting his head, only to spot Anna stepping onto the highway. A white car swerves erratically to avoid hitting her, just as an ambulance crests the hill bridge, racing towards the scene.\n\nHoward dashes along the highway towards Anna but freezes mid-stride as the speeding ambulance hurtles towards her. In a desperate move, Howard lunges for Anna, scooping her up in his arms. Suddenly, the scene freezes, and events unfold in reverse: Enrique is seen bouncing off the windscreen of a red sedan, and a fiery explosion shrinks into nothingness, leaving only black.\n\nElsewhere, marksmen perch on the rooftops of tall buildings, watching as the President's motorcade approaches the plaza. Inside one of the cars, President Ashton is on a phone call, flanked by Cavic and another agent. The motorcade comes to a halt in the shadows under a bridge, where a dark-suited man, later identified as Ted Heinkin, climbs into the car. Ashton lowers his phone, and Heinkin hangs it up, his eyes narrowing with concern. Two flags are swiftly removed from the President's limousine, and Heinkin places a document in a folder, slamming it shut. Ashton gazes out of the window, his expression grave.\n\nMeanwhile, a seething crowd fills the Plaza Mayor, waving placards and protesting as the President's limousine drives into the hotel's underground car park. Government agents stand guard outside the Hotel Vesta, their vigilant eyes scanning the area. Ashton exits his limo in the bright, nearly empty parking lot, accompanied by Heinkin and silver-haired Phil McCullough. An agent swipes a card through a machine and speaks into a radio, granting them access. Outside the plaza, protesters wave an inflatable skull and skeleton hands, their chants filling the air.\n\nInside the hotel, Matthews and Holden approach the limousine, with Matthews opening the door for Ashton's double. In the elevator, Ashton pores over a folder of large photographs, while a guilt-ridden McCullough looks away awkwardly. Ashton stares at McCullough before stepping out of the elevator, followed closely by Heinkin and McCullough.\n\nBack at the plaza, the crowd waves Spanish flags as Secret Service agents escort Ashton's double to the podium. De Soto takes his position at the lectern, ready to address the gathering. In his hotel room, Ashton parts the curtains and gazes out at the Plaza Mayor, his eyes fixed on the live television footage. Secret Service agents take their positions around Ashton's double on the red-carpeted podium.\n\nSuddenly, chaos erupts as Ashton's double is shot. McCullough lunges for the phone, and Barnes floors Enrique, pinning him down. Ashton watches the live footage in disbelief, transfixed by the unfolding drama.",

The tranquility is shattered by the thunderous sound of a herd of horses stampeding past the house, driven by Drover. With a burst of energy, he sprints up to Sarah, who awaits him on the porch, and leaps into her arms. Their reunion is marked by a passionate kiss, a moment of intense emotion that seems to halt time.\n\nMeanwhile, drama unfolds elsewhere as Fletcher knocks Carney into a swamp with his rifle, leaving the cattle king to the mercy of a crocodile's jaws.

Meanwhile, a boy lies beneath the water, eyes wide, as a white man in a suit plummets in and dies, his blood diffusing through the water. The lifeless body sinks to the riverbed. The boy surfaces, startled by a panicked horse floundering in the water. Reaching out, he calms the horse, stroking its muzzle, before climbing onto its back and urging it out of the water.\n\nClad only in shorts, his long hair flowing behind him, the boy traverses a dusty, sparsely treed landscape punctuated by towering rock formations. Passing through a rustic settlement—Faraway Downs—filled with wooden buildings and animal pens, he notices smoke from a bonfire mingling with dust in the air, and an animal skull dangling from a dry branch.

She surveys the chaos—a barman wielding a truncheon and a drunk slumped in the corner. Exasperated, the barman rolls his eyes as Sarah heads for the door.\n\nExiting, she's confronted by Drover and Bull brawling, using her luggage as weapons. Clothes explode from a burst suitcase, catching the eye of Carney, who watches through binoculars. Pushing through the melee, Sarah is horrified to see Drover smashing a case over Bull's head, finally felling him. Seeing the exhausted Drover, she's appalled.

By nightfall, they set up camp around a fire. Drover is seen washing his muscled torso with water from a bucket. Sarah, popping her head out of her tent, stares as water cascades off his rippling muscles. They playfully mime keeping each other warm, and she quickly ducks back into her tent. Drover, with a raised eyebrow, walks towards her and suggestively pulls down the waistband of his trousers.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, camels pull a truck with no engine, observed by Goolaj and Magarri. A man falls off the vehicle, landing in a heap in the dust. Later, he is seen in the truck next to a horrified Sarah. Drover nods, and they continue driving across a flat, dusty plain, bumping slowly along a rocky track. A girl runs up to them, and a boy gallops on a horse through sparse trees, arriving at Faraway Downs. He reins in the horse, looking out at the approaching truck, then runs through the gate to the house, leaping over a fence. They narrowly miss the horse, which rears up.\n\nThick smoke obscures the house as the boy climbs into the water tower. Drover walks through the smoke, and the boy drops down inside the tower. Sarah sits uncomfortably next to the drunk Kipling. As the smoke clears, a large house is revealed. Kipling collapses, and Drover, shrouded in smoke, walks past a dead cow. Sarah, with a set jaw, gets out of the truck and stomps furiously towards the house. Drover approaches a blazing funeral fire, examining it thoughtfully and looking around. The boy stretches out his hands, and an aboriginal sits on the ground.\n\nAs Sarah enters the house, women hold out buckets of smoking leaves. The boy poses mystically. Sarah strides past members of the household and sees her husband, dead on a table. She reels in shock at the sight of the wound in the middle of his chest and his glassy, staring eyes. She reaches out to close Maitland's eyes, but a man's hand does it for her. She eyes the man, her hand poised near Maitland's face, as members of staff hover in the corners of the room. The house is shrouded in a cloud of dust and smoke, a big blaze but tiny in the vast landscape.",
    "1073": "In the tall grass, a boy watches intently. With a smile as arid as the vast plains extending to the distant hills, he accompanies Sarah down the hillside, leaving the cemetery behind. The sun descends, casting a darkening shadow over the plains and hills, as night falls on Faraway Downs, extinguishing all lights. Basking in the moonlit room, Sarah sleeps soundly.\n\nGazing into the night, Fletcher ushers an aboriginal lady indoors while King George chants beside a fire. Abruptly, Sarah awakens and lights a lamp, her heart pounding as something stirs beneath the steps, and King George dances by his hilltop fire. Rushing inside, she finds the boy in her room; he strikes a playful pose, grinning broadly as the curtains billow. Intrigued, Sarah looks around, then moves to the window with Nullah. She jumps, startled, as a shadow falls across the porch, but Fletcher, peering through the shutters, sees nothing and departs.\n\nMorning arrives with clothes hanging on a line under the sun's warm glow. Fletcher emerges from his cabin, puzzled, as Nullah's mother lingers in the doorway. She follows him out, wearing an orange dress, then walks away after a glance at Fletcher. He tosses a stone, watching her go, under the clear blue sky. Sarah steps onto the main house's veranda, Nullah trailing behind. As two riders approach, Nullah dashes off, hiding behind the gate before slowly approaching them. Sarah greets them nervously, while Nullah slips away from the Chinese cook.\n\nMeanwhile, the boy, having climbed the windmill, removes a chain, setting the blades free to turn. Rusty water pumps from a pipe as everyone watches in awe. Enraged, Fletcher pursues the boy, but Nullah leaps clear of his grasp. Fletcher strikes the boy, holding his mother aside, just as Sarah intervenes, striking Fletcher with a riding crop. With steely resolve, she points him away. Fletcher reaches his truck, scans his surroundings, and backs up defiantly as Flynn joins Sarah. Driving off, Fletcher's drovers abandon the cattle to ride off with him.\n\nSing Song observes the scene emotionlessly, while Nullah, his mother, and her friend gather with Sarah. Flynn, removing his hat respectfully, joins them too. Sarah surveys her small group, turns, and shields her eyes from the sun. Later, she sits at her cluttered desk, reflecting on the day's events.",
    "1077": "In a sudden burst of urgency, Nullah rushes towards Flynn, but the panicked animals trample Flynn under their thundering hooves. Nullah recoils at the horrifying sight and stands isolated, confronting the stampede on the precipice of a cliff. Time seems to slow as the stampede advances closer to Nullah, who stands precariously on the cliff's edge. Meanwhile, Drover and Sarah spur their horses forward with desperate determination.\n\nFletcher watches the scene unfold with a cruel smirk. Nullah focuses intently, stretching out his arms wide. His grandfather joins him in a solemn chant, their voices merging in harmony. The herd begins to decelerate, coming to a dramatic halt just yards from Nullah's fragile form. Above, King George observes the unfolding drama with a watchful gaze.\n\nAs Sarah and Drover arrive on the scene, Nullah's emotions overwhelm him, and he begins to weep. Sarah swiftly dismounts her horse and wraps her arms around him, pulling him back from the brink of the abyss just in time. Drover lunges forward, catching them both and pulling them to safety. Nullah looks up at Sarah with wide, tearful eyes before nuzzling into her shoulder for comfort. Drover, feeling out of place, steps back awkwardly, leaving the pair to their moment. King George looks on with a proud smile.\n\nIn a swift and decisive move, Drover gallops towards Flynn, who lies lifeless and bloodied on the dusty ground. Leaning in, Drover places his ear close to Flynn's mouth, straining to hear any final words. Flynn's eyes flutter briefly before closing forever. Drover retrieve's his hat from beside the fallen man and firmly places it back on his head. His gaze falls upon Flynn's harmonica, still clutched in the dead man's hand.\n\nAmidst the smoldering remnants of their camp, Nullah holds the harmonica while Sarah sits nearby, a mix of embarrassment and grief etched on her face. Nullah extends one of her hats towards her, but she drops it to the ground, her face crumpling with sorrow. Drover approaches, standing resolutely beside her as they share a look of unspoken determination.\n\nUnder the blazing sun and a sky dappled with wisps of white clouds, the cattle drive presses on. Sarah rides with newfound confidence, wielding her whip with the skill of a seasoned hand. Nullah diligently rounds up a stray steer, reuniting it with the herd as they march steadfastly towards the golden hues of the setting sun.\n\nBack at the cliff, Fletcher stands atop Flynn's rocky grave, his crocodile-skinned boot planted firmly on the pile. He picks up a stone, turning it over thoughtfully as he gazes into the abyss. His men approach on horseback while a gentle breeze dislodges Flynn's hat from the grave's wooden cross. Fletcher's eyes linger on the distant herd, visible only as a cloud of dust on the horizon.\n\nAs night falls, Drover's team sets up camp by a meandering river. They gather around, swigging Poor Fella Rum from tin cups, while Drover drinks straight from the bottle. The potent liquor proves no match for Sing Song and Sarah, who eagerly extend their cups for more. An empty bottle rolls to the feet of a startled wallaby, which sniffs at it curiously.\n\nSarah rises and approaches Drover, who leans against a nearby tree. Their laughter subsides as they become lost in each other's eyes. Slowly, their faces draw nearer, and Sarah's bright blue eyes flutter closed as they share a tender, heartfelt kiss.",
    "1078": "In the opening scene, Nullah descends from a tree, finding Sarah and the Drover standing together, a hint of guilt in their posture. Sarah's gaze follows Nullah curiously as he moves away, pensively. She is visibly shocked by his appearance, and he, in turn, regards her steadily. He approaches her, and she looks up, only to have her smile fade as quickly as it appeared, her eyes shifting to the ground. He offers a tight smile before walking away, leaving Sarah to hesitate before wandering through the tall grass.\n\nThe scene shifts to daylight, where a dead steer lies beside a watering hole. Magarri inspects the water thoughtfully as Drover, Sarah, and Nullah arrive. The vast, sandy desert stretches out before them, the atmosphere somber. Across the dusty plain, a solitary figure approaches—King George, standing on one leg and leaning on his spear, his form shimmering through the dust. They move towards him, and as sunset paints the sky with fiery hues, King George begins to sing, jump, and dance with his spears.\n\nA dust storm engulfs the drove, causing the cattle to stir restlessly. King George’s singing continues, echoing through the chaos. Nullah dreams of his grandfather discovering water and catching a fish, a vision that materializes in the twilit desert as King George holds up a fish on a pole, his chanting resonating through the air, his body caked in dust.\n\nBack in Darwin, Carney offers a pen to the captain, who hesitates over a purchase agreement while Fletcher hangs up the phone in the cattle pen. The salon women watch in amazement as a calf meanders past the window, and the building trembles as the captain signs the agreement. The town is suddenly filled with the thunder of hooves as the drove charges in, leaving Carney frowning and the salon women staring in awe. Carney peers through his blinds as Sarah rides up, his glare unwavering. They turn their horses and gallop away, prompting Carney to dive for the phone.\n\nFletcher watches in disbelief as the Drover jumps his horse into the holding yard, cracking his whip amidst Fletcher's frantic attempts to rally his team. The gates close before the Drover, and the cattle stream into the wooden loading tunnel, with Sarah leading her herd towards the docks. The Carney men laugh as they urge their cattle into the loading tunnel running down the wharf. The Drover pauses, then rides off, jumping the fence and knocking out the top slat, heading straight for the street outside the Territory Hotel. Fletcher's glare follows him as the Drover watches the Carney herd being loaded, then rides towards the cargo vessel at the end of the wharf.",
    "1079": "As the film begins, a wooden loading tunnel extends directly to a bustling scene. Fletcher, caught in a moment of tension, watches as policemen file out of their office. Meanwhile, Administrator Allsop peers through his telescope, surveying the area. The action escalates as Drover, with a burst of speed, gallops through Carney's men, slicing the rope that holds up the gate at the tunnel's end. The gate slams shut, effectively trapping the cattle inside. Drover, with a forceful crack of his whip, drives Sarah's cattle thundering down the wharf, to the cheers of the townspeople who line the route, their enthusiasm palpable as Sarah rides past the hotel. The cattle, a relentless stream, pour onto a waiting ship.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, Nullah rides up to Sarah, who acknowledges him with a triumphant nod and smile as he follows the last of the herd onto the ship. Her gaze then locks onto Fletcher, their eyes meeting in a tense standoff. Sarah, not one to back down, rides towards him, her whip cracking mere inches from his face, leaving him visibly shaken. She rides off, her grin wide and confident, while Nullah chases the final steer onto the ship.\n\nThe town's jubilation is infectious as Drover escorts Sarah through the cheering crowd to the pub. Pride radiates from Sarah as two glasses are filled with Poor Fella Rum at the bar. They down the potent drink, gasping at its strength, and their laughter fills the air as they stare into each other's eyes, a moment of shared victory.\n\nThe scene shifts to Fletcher, answering the phone at the holding yard, under the stern gaze of Carney who watches from his veranda. Fletcher's demeanor is one of defeat, his shoulders slumped as he stands by the phone. Meanwhile, Sarah, her eyes brimming with tears of joy, embraces Drover warmly.\n\nThe film then offers a glimpse into Drover's gentler side as he exercises Capricornia in a small yard. Sarah, stepping onto the balcony above, observes him nuzzling the horse with affection. As she makes her way downstairs, Drover demonstrates his skill by getting the mare to lie down, leaving Sarah watching in awe. However, their moment is interrupted as Drover, startled, turns away, his expression thoughtful but distant. He breaks eye contact, nods, and walks off, leaving Sarah feeling uncomfortable and disappointed.\n\nElsewhere, Nullah sits glumly by a cooking fire with Sing Song and Bandy Legs. A nearby man watches intently as Sarah smears black ash on Nullah's cheek, offering him a smile. Later, seated in the black section of the audience with Sing Song, Bandy turns to look up at Nullah, who is perched in the rafters near the projector, his eyes wide with wonder.\n\nThe tension rises again as all eyes turn to Carney, who swigs from a wine bottle before approaching Sarah. She, cool and composed, places his bottle on a waiter's tray. As King, with a broad smile, leads her to the dance floor, Fletcher watches intently from the punchbowl. A photographer captures the moment, but Sarah seems distracted, her frown indicating her wariness.\n\nThe garden scene shifts, with Allsop pausing to stare as everyone turns to look up at the house. Sarah turns, her gasp audible as she stands and stares. At the top of the steps, clean-shaven and dressed in a white tuxedo, stands Drover, a commanding presence amidst the chaos.",
    "1083": "In the heart of a quiet cabin, Tuvia broods over the sight of sick individuals sprawled within. Suddenly, Lilka enters, her gaze meeting Tuvia's searching eyes as she returns a revolver to him. Shifting to an army camp, Viktor studies a chart intently before Tuvia arrives, drawing a mix of reactions. Zus briefly acknowledges Tuvia's presence before retreating and then reapproaching him.\n\nUnder the cloak of night in the deserted town of Stakiewicze, Zus and Tuvia sit tense in a parked vehicle. Tuvia, wracked by coughs, retrieves an ornate Mezuzah case. Zus, in a swift motion, seizes it and exits the truck, beckoning Benzion and Krensky. The trio, heads low, dash towards the Nazi-flagged police station. Tuvia, feverish and anxious, watches intently from the vehicle, his grip tightening on his gun at the flash of gunfire.\n\nInside the police station, chaos erupts. Krensky is fatally shot, but Benzion retaliates, killing two officers. Zus, undeterred, rushes into another office, dodging the police chief's shots just long enough to take him down. Desperately, Zus grabs a sackful of medicine bottles from a cupboard. Meanwhile, Benzion, after smashing the transmitter, is gunned down by a policeman who meets his end at Zus's hands as Zus retreats, clutching a stomach wound.\n\nOutside, dread etched on his face, Tuvia watches their vehicle speed away from the town, Zus wincing in pain but holding tight to the precious medicine. Later, Shimon solemnly officiates a burial, while Tuvia battles fever in his cabin.\n\nAt mealtime, Arkady, standing at the food table, exchanges angry glares with Asael; knives are drawn. Arkady, noticing Tuvia's pale, feverish face, retreats with a sneer, leaving Asael to seethe silently. Observing the tension, both Asael and Lilka appear anxious.\n\nBack at the army camp, Zus sits alone, his anger boiling as he witnesses Lova, covered in blood, kneeling by a water basin. Viktor, in his tent, plays his accordion, his eyes bleary with intoxication, while Gramov whistles alongside. Viktor, dismissing Zus with a wave, continues his drinking, nonchalant despite Zus's simmering rage as he departs.",
    "1084": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film opens with a group of soldiers on the move, Viktor and Gramov at the forefront on horseback, while Zus and the rest of the troop follow on foot. Back at the camp, Tuvia is confined to his cabin, grappling with a fever, while outside, the community waits patiently in a queue for food. Arkady and his friend lighten the mood by sharing a joke. Suddenly, Aron rushed to his brother's cabin. Meanwhile, Chaya serves Arkady a hearty meal, and Tuvia emerges from his cabin, noticing Asael's black eye. Asael looks towards Arkady, who is ostentatiously enjoying his food, feigning ignorance of their stares.\n\n Arkady, with a defiant smirk, finally turns to face Tuvia, sensing the fear in the crowd around them. Tuvia, in disbelief, turns to the community and then, in a sudden burst of violence, spins around and shoots Arkady at point-blank range before lowering his gun. The men at the table swiftly carry off Arkady's lifeless body, passing by Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel. Tuvia, with his two younger brothers by his side, confronts the stunned crowd.\n\nIn the quiet of his cabin, Tuvia lies in bed, a blanket tucked around him. He awakens briefly to see Lilka's smiling face, her presence comforting him before he drifts back to sleep. She sits beside him, bathed in the soft golden light filtering through the log cabin. Morning finds Tuvia on watch, machine gun in hand. Asael peeks out of his cabin as the icicles begin to thaw, and Lilka basks in the warmth of the sun. Tuvia ventures out into the hazy morning light, traversing the melting snow.\n\nThe camp comes together for a group photograph, the camera lens capturing the assembled Bielski community. Nearby, women wash in the creek, with Bella playfully splashing Chaya. Meanwhile, Tamara, visibly anxious despite the sunshine, tightens her black coat around her. Lilka, noticing her distress, steps out of the water to meet her. Tamara, with a nervous glance, leads Lilka out of earshot and reveals her secret—she's pregnant. Lilka, her clear blue eyes filled with empathy, gently supports Tamara as her face crumples with emotion.\n\nAmidst this tableau, Tuvia descends through the trees, gun in hand, a silent sentinel watching over the camp. The journey of these individuals and their shared experiences offers a vivid portrait of resilience, love, and the complexities of human nature, all interwoven within the fabric of their community.",
    "1088": "In the throes of battle, a barrage of cannonballs decimates the Bielski lines, claiming more lives. Asael, blinded by the smoke, fires his gun indiscriminately. Meanwhile, Tuvia, renewed in strength and spirit, tosses a bag to Malvin and sprints across the field, diving into the dense woodland behind enemy lines. From their concealed position, they spot German soldiers and a tank ahead. Crouching low, they watch as half a dozen Germans set up a gun position mere steps away. With a steely gaze, Tuvia steps forward, mowing down the soldiers with his machine gun. Seizing the German weapon, he opens fire on the unsuspecting troops, felling several before the Germans regroup.\n\nThe tank's massive gun begins to swing towards Tuvia and Malvin. As the dark muzzle inches closer, Tuvia narrowly evades the blast, diving behind a tree. More Germans swarm the field, taking cover just yards away, as shells detonate on either side of Tuvia. Malbin, hidden behind a nearby tree, readies an explosive. With a determined grimace, he charges the tank, only to be cut down by gunfire, the missile exploding around him.\n\nThe Germans turn their fire on Tuvia, shells ricocheting off the surrounding trees. One soldier advances, only to be felled by a bullet to the back. As the other Germans glance backwards, Zus bursts from the tree line, catching the enemy off guard and single-handedly decimating their ranks. His men follow, swiftly overwhelming the remaining Germans.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the tank operator fires again. Zus climbs atop the tank, dispatching the operator before dropping a grenade into the vehicle. His men fan out across the field, eliminating the last of the Germans. Standing atop the tank, Zus scans the trees, anxious and alert. Around him, his men scavenge the pockets of the fallen soldiers.\n\nThrough the smoky haze, Tuvia emerges, his vivid blue eyes scanning the scene. Up on the hillside, the Bielski Otriad raises their heads, their guns at the ready. Slowly, they rise to their feet, ascending the sun-drenched slope as the battle subsides.",
    "1080": "In the grim glow of grainy black and white footage, Adolph Hitler, with his arm extended at a sharp angle, performs the Nazi salute as he reviews troops while his impassioned speech blares in the background. A Nazi motorcade advances towards a curved metal bridge, the dreadful sight accompanied by a skull and crossbones flag fluttering in the breeze. Meanwhile, a man is brutally dragged across the street, joined by others, each bearing identifying labels on their backs, all mercilessly hounded by Nazi officers. The chilling sequence of events unravels as Jews are callously shot and left in a ditch, and women, trembling in fear, are forcefully pushed from their homes. An old woman collapses to the ground, only to be harshly dragged back to her feet. Elderly men in cloth caps, bags slung over their shoulders, and women carrying cases are herded from their village like cattle.\n\nThe atrocities escalate as black uniformed SS officers kick a defenseless man on the ground, and a helmeted German soldier shoots another man in the back without hesitation. An officer, with cold detachment, pulls a revolver from his pocket, raises it, and a young man crumples lifelessly to the ground. The officer casually returns his gun to his pocket and resumes his conversation, all while an army photographer callously films the horrifying events unfolding. Small children are hauled into trucks, families are torn apart, and an SS officer, cigarette dangling from his lips, watches with grim satisfaction as a truckload of people is escorted by Nazi outriders, the scene intently observed by two men hiding behind a tree—one in his thirties, the other in his early twenties.\n\nNearby, they witness villagers being led into a wood by black-shirts and their snarling dogs. The two watchers flee the scene, their escape punctuated by the sight of a body lying face-down in a marshy pond. They vault over a farm gate, discovering a man slumped against the farm fence. The younger man, Asael, drops his head, breathing heavily, and looks up helplessly at his older brother, Zus.\n\nZus, tall and dark-haired, unshaven and carrying a small axe, creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low door, and steps inside. Crouching down, he pulls back two planks from the floor, revealing a small boy with a blackened face and hands peering up at his two older brothers. Warily, the boy takes Zus' hand and steps out of the hole. Zus pats the boy's face, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over the boy's shoulder. Zus, noticing something in the doorway, removes a narrow ornamental case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah, from the right-hand side of the door frame. He grabs the saw and a cloth bag and hurriedly leads his little brother away, past a flock of ducks.\n\nFinally, Zus holds his brother to his feet and leans him against a tree, patting Asael's neck. For a moment, Zus rests his head against his brother's brow, a fleeting moment of solace amidst the chaos.",

    "1098": "In the quiet of Walt's house, Sue tentatively approaches the mesh basement door. Suddenly, Walt bolts out the back door, with Sue in hot pursuit. Under the cover of night, Walt finds himself standing outside Smokie's house, gazing up at it, his face half-shrouded in shadow. A gangster, spotting Walt from a window, alerts the others. Smokie and Spider emerge to confront him, backed by more gang members, with Spider drawing a gun. Neighbors, drawn by the commotion, begin to watch from their windows. Walt, with a cigarette in hand, boldly mimes shooting the gangsters with his finger, then calmly places the cigarette in his mouth. More neighbors spill out to witness the scene. Walt's hand slowly dips into his jacket, then swiftly emerges, triggering a hail of bullets from the gangsters. Walt's body is brutally riddled, and he collapses backwards, his hand falling open to reveal his 1st Cavalry lighter. Blood trickles down his sleeve, pooling in his palm and dripping from his mouth. The unlit cigarette rests beside his lifeless body, splayed out in a cruciform position.\n\nPolice cars soon flood the area, their lights flashing in the darkness. Walt's Gran Torino pulls up, and Thao and Sue rush out, hurriedly approaching a police officer. The trio—Sue, Thao, and Father Janovich—somberly watch as Walt's body, now in a bag, is loaded into an ambulance. Father Janovich's gaze shifts to the handcuffed gangsters kneeling on the grass, overseen by a stern police captain. Thao's lip is bitten raw with emotion as Spider, then a defiant Smokie—still bruised from Walt's blow—are led away in handcuffs. Thao's breath hitches, his emotions surging, as he takes in the Silver Star still pinned to Walt's T-shirt.\n\nDays later, Sue and Thao, dressed in intricately embroidered traditional Hmong attire, leave their house with their mother. Sue dons a turban-like headdress, and they all climb into a waiting taxi, leaving Grandma on the porch with Daisy, who lies sadly at the top of the steps. At the church, a multitude of mourners gather for Walt's funeral. He lies in an open casket at the altar, dressed in his new suit. Mitch and Karen take their seats beside Steve, Mitch glaring at Thao across the aisle. Father Janovich steps forward to begin the service.\n\nLater, the family convenes for the reading of Walt's will. Mitch and Steve exchange a meaningful look, while Ashley smiles in anticipation, eager to hear what's in store.",
    "1099": "In the opening scene, a man extinguishes a cigarette beneath his foot, his gaze fixed incredulously on Ashley as he moves towards the door, spits, and exits. Ashley, in response, rolls her eyes dramatically. The man, Walt, opens his front door to reveal a teenager, Thao, but abruptly slams it shut and turns his attention to Father Janovich, a fresh-faced priest whom he brusquely pushes past. Meanwhile, next door, a steady flow of Southeast Asian Hmong people, most bearing plates or bowls of food, approach the front door. As the mourners depart, Walt uses jump leads to assist a woman with her car. Mitch drives up in a Toyota Land Cruiser, capturing Walt's attention as he straightens up and watches the silver vehicle leave. Placing his jump leads on a garden table, Walt ascends to his back porch, his eyes scanning the neighboring garden where family and friends are gathered. He snarls at the sight of an elder in ceremonial dress preparing to slaughter a chicken.\n\nIn the neighboring garden, a grandmother converses with a middle-aged man as the extended family gathers before the elder, Kor Khue. With a shake, Kor Khue animates a hoop adorned with metal rings, a young woman holding a brightly embroidered papoose with a baby stands beside him. He lays the hoop on the carpet, tossing a split horn into it. Thao emerges from the back door as Kor Khue, with cupped hands, gestures to the mother and child, the father raising his hands beside them.\n\nNext door, Walt meticulously sweeps his drive with a broom, his Labrador, Daisy, scampering down the front steps. He pauses, observing Thao walking up his front steps, noting the thin and parched grass in the neighboring garden. Grandma, seated on the porch, watches Walt intently, muttering to herself. Walt, glaring, spits towards her, and she responds with a copious spit of her own, causing him to grimace. Retreating inside, Walt leans down to Daisy by the front door before opening it to Father Janovich, only to shut it again immediately.\n\nThao wanders along a high chain link fence, engrossed in a book. A large black sedan with side exhaust pipes rolls up, two heavy-duty Latino guys leaning out of the window. Thao continues walking, smiling to himself. A white car containing five South Asian guys stops ahead, the driver, Spider, distinguished by his long black hair and bandanna. Spotting Thao, Spider drives down the road, stopping beside the black sedan. He and his passenger, Smokie, lean out of the window, revealing a revolver and a machine pistol. The Latino guys speed off, and Spider reverses up beside Thao. As Spider exits the vehicle, Thao walks on, and they eventually drive off, leaving Thao to continue his journey. Later, Thao tends to the garden while his sister Sue sits on the front steps, engrossed in a book.",
    "1103": "Walt ascends the stairs, with a group of boys trailing behind her. Meanwhile, Walt approaches Thao, who looks away as Walt takes a sip of his drink before marching off, leaving Thao with a mix of dejection and contemplation. Later, Walt meticulously mows his front lawn using a manual push mower. He pauses as he notices two of his Hmong neighbors bringing flowers to his house, their smiles warm and friendly. Walt continues his task but soon stops to watch them as they retreat. Later that day, he opens his door to find more neighbors, this time bearing food. He inhales the aroma appreciatively and welcomes the three women inside, following them in.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, Walt pulls into his driveway in his pickup truck to find Sue, Thao, and their mother waiting for him. He dismisses them but later, while enjoying a cup of coffee on his porch, he stands up as Thao approaches, looking sheepish. Walt leaves Thao and heads towards his garage. When Thao finds Walt, he is intently watching over his abatis border, deep in thought. Thao, observing Walt's focus, shrugs thoughtfully. Walt's gaze then shifts to a dilapidated house across the street.\n\nThao begins to fix the old house, climbing a ladder to remove a louvered shutter from the roof. In the garden, he uproots a dead tree and loads rubble into a wheelbarrow. Walt watches from across the street, chewing tobacco, accompanied by Daisy. Thao meticulously fixes the house number onto a post on the porch, scrapes off old paint from the clapboard exterior, and gives it a fresh coat. Even in the pouring rain, Thao struggles with an old tree stump in the garden, eventually digging it out. Exhausted, he takes a seat by the stump.\n\nWalt witnesses this hard work, smoking a cigarette as an elder Hmong man and a young girl approach him on his front steps. Later, with a grin, Thao walks up Walt's front steps, rubbing his blistered hands together. Upon seeing Walt spit blood into the sink and regard himself in the mirror, it appears that Thao’s presence poses a certain contemplation for Walt. Although Thao's smile fades and he turns to leave, Walt's expression softens. Thao leaves the porch as Walt disappears inside, shutting the door.\n\nIn another scene, Walt sits in a doctor's waiting room, observing the diverse array of patients—an Indian woman beside him, an Indian man and a black woman opposite him. A Muslim nurse wearing a headscarf appears, causing Walt to frown in irritation before he gets up. A female Oriental doctor checks his notes, marking the end of this sequence.",
    "1106": "Walt, in a fit of rage, begins to wreck his kitchen, punching in cupboard doors and kicking tables, sending them crashing over in the front room. Terrified, Daisy runs for cover as Walt, bleeding, collapses into an armchair, his gaze distant and grim. A tear rolls down his cheek, cutting through the dried blood on his face. Quietly, Daisy joins him, sitting by his side.\n\nA knock at the door announces Father Janovich's arrival. Letting himself in, the priest finds Walt smoking, lost in thought. He perches on a nearby coffee table, beside an open photo album, and stares at Walt, who drags on his cigarette, deep in reflection. Rising, Father Janovich fetches four cans of beer, sharing a couple with Walt. They drink in tense silence, Walt's stare unblinking.\n\nThe next morning, Thao finds Walt in the kitchen, nursing a coffee. They sit together, Walt's scornful look prompting Thao's reluctant nod before he departs. Later, Walt is seen meticulously mowing his lawn, then relaxing in a bath, cigarette in hand, Daisy by his side. Martin gives Walt a haircut, pocketing the payment with a chuckle. At the tailor's, Walt is fitted for a suit.\n\nIn church, Father Janovich spots Walt while reading from the Bible. They meet in the confessional, stepping out afterwards. Walt walks away, looks back, and leaves with a small smile. Back home, Walt cleans his Colt .45 at the kitchen table. Thao enters, picking up Walt's rifle, accidentally pointing it at him. Walt leads Thao to the basement, showing him a medal, which he pins onto Thao's chest. Returning upstairs, Walt locks Thao in the basement.\n\nWith Daisy in tow, Walt visits Thao's house, tying Daisy to Grandma's chair on the porch. Meanwhile, Sue, bearing bruises on her swollen face, leaves her bed and goes outside, Grandma trailing her to Walt's house. Across town, Father Janovich accompanies the police as they apprehend someone at Smokie's house and drive away.\n\nIn this chronicle of events, Walt's volatile emotions and actions unfold, intertwined with the lives of those around him. Each scene captures a moment of turmoil, reflection, or quiet tension, painting a vivid portrait of Walt's journey.",
    "1108": "In the sprawling grandeur of a vast chamber, a gigantic figure retreats, leaving Harry in a state of uncertain contemplation, silently shaking his head. The scene shifts dramatically to a pristine, white landscape where elegant white horses emerge from a snow-laden forest, pulling stylish sleighs filled with students bundled against the biting cold. Inside the Great Hall, now adorned with towering Christmas trees, the ceiling mirrors the wintry scene outside, as large snowflakes gently drift above students seated at long, gleaming dining tables.\n\nAt the end of one such table, Harry and Ron sit alone until Hermione joins them, carrying her meal. She produces two cakes, drawing Harry and Ron into a clandestine plan. Peering around a corridor statue to ensure no one is watching, Ron lifts his bent wand, followed by Harry's own wand gesture. The cakes levitate, hovering in mid-air. Seizing the opportunity, Crabbe and Goyle appear, laden with more cakes, and swiftly grab the floating treats. They devour them greedily, only to freeze mid-chew, their eyes rolling back as they collapse onto the floor.\n\nLater, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione fills three glasses with a thick, dubious-looking potion. She distributes them to Harry and Ron, who eye the sludge warily. Adding hairs to the concoction, they clink glasses and drink. Ron recoils, rushing to a cubicle with Hermione close behind. Harry, clutching his stomach in pain, stumbles to a marble sink. His hands begin to swell and distort, a transformation reflected in his face as he gazes into the mirror. Slowly, Harry morphs into the bulky form of Goyle, his reflection revealing a satisfied grin. Turning, he finds Ron emerging from the cubicle, now the spitting image of the portly Crabbe. They exchange stunned glances.\n\nIn a dimly lit corridor, Percy Weasley spots the transformed duo, drawing Draco Malfoy's scrutiny. Draco shoots Percy a scathing look before retreating to the Slytherin common room, where he slouches onto a leather sofa. Harry and Ron, nervously surveying their surroundings, sit opposite him. Ron's fist clenches, but a nudge from Harry keeps him in check. Draco rises, looming over Harry with a menacing stare before thankfully retreating. Ron's surprise is palpable as he handles a small parcel, shaking it curiously. Harry's disapproving head shake prompts Draco to pocket the package, causing Ron to leap up in protest. Harry's warning touch to his reemerging scar quells Ron's dismay, leaving them both tense and alert.",
    "1109": "Ron's hair begins to change, turning a vivid shade of red. Suddenly, they both pivot and dash out of the common room. The scene shifts back to the girls' lavatory, where Myrtle drifts past eerily. Meanwhile, Hermione, still in her uniform, has transformed into a cat. Outside, lightning crackles and flashes ominously. Inside, Ron and Harry ascend the stairs, only to halt abruptly as they encounter a pool of water on the landing. Undeterred, they splash through it.\n\nIn the girls' lavatory, chaos reigns as all the taps are left running, causing the sinks to overflow. Harry and Ron survey the mess, their eyes finally landing on Myrtle, perched high on a curved stone windowsill. Ron recoils slightly. As Myrtle floats past again, Harry's gaze falls upon a book with a worn, black leather cover lying on the stone floor. He retrieves it, shaking off the excess water, but the book is soaked through.\n\nLater, seated at his desk, Harry flips through the now-dried pages, finding them all blank. He examines the book again, noticing a name embossed in gold letters on the back. Setting the book down, he picks up a quill, dips it into the inkwell, and attempts to write on the first empty page. A drop of ink falls from the quill, hitting the paper and slowly vanishing. Harry turns the page, but the ink blot is gone. He dips his quill again and starts to write, watching as his words fade into the paper, only to be replaced by new words appearing on the page. He writes again, and this time, an answer materializes.\n\nHarry leans back, a mix of disappointment and curiosity on his face. More words begin to appear, and the blank pages start to turn themselves over rapidly. He lifts the book with both hands, staring at it intently. A bright light bursts from the pages, blinding Harry. As the light envelops him, the book on his desk snaps shut, and he disappears.\n\nIn an instant, Harry is transported back in time, reappearing in a school corridor. He cautiously approaches the foot of a wide staircase, where a teenage boy in a Hogwarts uniform stands at the bend, fixated on the landing above. Harry climbs the stairs towards him, following his gaze to see four people carrying a stretcher covered with a sheet down the stairs. As they pass, Harry glimpses a limp arm sticking out from under the sheet.\n\nA man with a long, brown beard, Dumbledore, appears at the top of the stairs, giving Harry a probing look. Meanwhile, Riddle turns and strides down a wide corridor illuminated by flaming torches. He hurriedly makes his way to the top of a narrow flight of stone steps, with Harry in pursuit. They descend into a gloomy corridor with rough stone walls. Riddle approaches a heavy wooden door, wand at the ready. He looks around cautiously before throwing open the door to reveal a shadowy figure bent over a large wooden box.",
    "1111": "In a flurry, a swarm of spiders surges into a dark tunnel, with Ron anxiously scanning the area before Harry, with Fang leading the way, enters the cramped and gloomy passage. Ron, panting and apprehensive, pauses briefly before following Harry. The tunnel's low ceiling forces them to crouch as they progress, unaware of the enormous spider descending from above, its silhouette framed by the faint light from the entrance. As they venture deeper, the tunnel widens into a sprawling, dim hollow tangled with gnarled tree roots. Harry and Ron pursue the spiders, only to find their path blocked by a colossal pit ringed with tattered webs. Their guide vanishes into the chasm, leaving the boys stranded a short distance away. Harry raises his lantern, uncertainty etched on his face.\n\nSuddenly, several elongated, hairy legs emerge from the pit. A monumental spider, comparable in size to a double-decker bus, looms over the edge, its beady eyes fixed on the pair. Terrified, the boys gape in disbelief, with Ron's whimpers falling silent as he points upward. Harry's gaze follows, revealing countless large spiders descending from the roots, suspended above their heads. Harry acknowledges Aragog with a polite nod, then swings and drops his lantern. Drawing their wands, they brace themselves as the spiders advance.\n\nJust in time, the Ford Anglia roars to a stop beside them, its doors flinging open. Fang leaps into the back while Ron and Harry scramble into the front seats, narrowly escaping the attacking arachnids. Ron shifts the car into reverse, scattering spiders as they careen backward through the tunnel. Bursting out of the entrance, the car soars through the air before hitting the ground with a jolt, dislodging a pursuing spider. However, the respite is brief as the spider seizes Ron through the open window. Reacting swiftly, Harry aims his wand and repels the creature.\n\nrelieved, Ron looks at Harry, but their ordeal is far from over. Through the cracked windscreen, they witness hundreds more spiders emerging from the shadowy trees, ready to pounce. Ron quickly starts the car and accelerates, the horde hot on their heels. The forest floor writhes with spiders, and more lurk in the branches, poised to attack. In desperation, Harry turns to Ron, who grabs the gear stick. Together, they heave the stick, sending the car soaring into the air. It smashes through branches, scattering spiders in a frantic bid for escape.",
    "1115": "In the dimly lit Chamber of Secrets, Harry stands triumphant beside the lifeless head of the basilisk. He tenderly touches Ginny's hand; she remains clutching Tom Riddle's diary. Seizing the diary, Harry opens it and raises the basilisk's venomous fang. With a swift motion, he stabs the diary, causing Riddle to convulse as a brilliant light bursts from his chest. Blood seeps across the page, but Harry strikes again, driving the fang deep into the diary's black leather cover. In a blinding flash, Riddle disintegrates, leaving only faint sparks.\n\nGinny abruptly awakens, confusion etched on her face. She finds Harry nursing his injured arm in pain. Suddenly, Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes, sweeps down, perching beside Harry. The magnificent bird gazes sadly at Harry, its huge tears falling onto his wounded arm. Ginny watches in awe as the phoenix's tears vaporize from the wound, miraculously healing the torn flesh. Harry looks up at Fawkes, gratitude shining in his eyes. Later, clinging to each other, Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny are carried to safety by the powerful phoenix, leaving the Chamber of Secrets behind.\n\nIn Dumbledore's study, Ron and Harry share a look of amazement. Ron departs, leaving Harry to nod thoughtfully as he takes the silver sword, examining the inscription on its blade. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and Lucius Malfoy storms in, Dobby trailing behind. Lucius strides towards Dumbledore, casting a glare at Harry. Harry looks to Dumbledore, who smiles as Harry holds up Tom Riddle's diary. Turning to Lucius, Dumbledore's smile fades as Lucius cruelly kicks Dobby down the stairs.\n\nHarry places the sword on the desk, his eyes fixed on the diary. He intercepts Lucius in the corridor, handing him the diary. Lucius sneers and turns away, but not before Dobby discovers a sock tucked within the diary's pages. Harry reveals his injured ankle to Lucius, who draws a wand from his cane and menacingly approaches. Bravely, Dobby steps between them, and with a wave of his hand, sends Lucius hurtling backward. The small elf stands victorious, arms folded, before turning and strutting away. Harry smiles, relieved.\n\nLater, the Great Hall is abuzz with students. Harry floats between the tables, Filch standing sternly by the door, petting his cat. At the Gryffindor table, Neville looks around anxiously. Hermione appears in the doorway, grinning broadly. Ron and Harry leap to their feet, overjoyed to see their friend alive and well, as she rushes to join them.",
    "1117": "In a fluid motion, she flicks her wand, and Harry's glasses magically mend themselves, causing him to blink in surprise. She then escorts him to a bustling bookshop where the Weasley family is standing near the counter, amidst a queue of eager customers awaiting book signings. Suddenly, a blond man in a blue suit and matching cloak materializes, wearing a smug smile. He strikes a pose for the camera, noticing Harry's unkempt face in the crowd. The photographer promptly pulls Harry forward, causing Ron to pull a disgruntled face. As they make their way to the door, a boy with very fair hair rips a page from a book and steps in front of Harry. A man with long fair hair touches Harry's forehead with his serpent-headed cane. Meanwhile, the Grangers are engrossed in conversation with Mr. Weasley, who glances at Ron before taking a book from Jenny's cauldron and sliping two books back into it. He offers a reassuring smile to his children as Lucius turns on his heel and Draco shoots a glare at Ron and Harry.\n\nThe scene shifts to King's Cross and St. Pancras Station, where Harry and Louisa rush along Platform 10 with loaded trolleys. The Weasley twins and Percy confidently push their trolleys straight towards the solid brick wall between platforms, disappearing through it one after the other, followed by Jenny and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Harry, closely followed by Ron, attempts the same but collides with the solid brick, tumbling into a chaotic heap of trolleys and luggage. Hedwig flaps her wings in alarm as a porter approaches. Ron, looking thoughtful, decides to take matters into his own hands. Outside the station, the blue Ford Anglia ascends unsteadily into the air, astonishing a taxi driver below. Ron manipulates a button on the dashboard, and high above London, the car vanishes into thin air.\n\nAs the thick cloud dissipates, low green hills come into view far below. The car reappears, with Ron changing gear and steering it down towards the railway line. They skim above the track, passing over a magnificent stone viaduct, only to look back in horror as the Hogwarts Express bears down on them. Ron jerks the wheel to the left, sending the car swerving away from the track and swooping under the viaduct. The car tumbles between the stone arches, flipping over repeatedly. The car door flings open, and Harry plummets out, desperately grabbing the door handle to hang on. Ron stretches down, and Harry reaches for his hand, managing to clamber back inside the car. Ron turns the wheel again, and the train thunderously chugs beneath a plume of white smoke.\n\nAs darkness descends, the car's headlights illuminate the towers of Hogwarts School. Ron glances at Harry, whose smile of delight fades as the car engine begins to falter. Ron wrestles with the wheel, the car swooping out of control and zooming perilously close to the brightly lit windows of the Great Hall.",
    "1119": "In the bustling Great Hall, a magical envelope morphs into a mouth, turning to face Ginny before blowing a teasing raspberry directly at Ron. Then, having delivered its message, the howler rips itself to shreds, the tiny pieces fluttering down onto the table. Hermione casts Ron a sympathetic glance as the commotion unfolds.\n\nThe scene shifts to a crowded classroom where the door creaks open, revealing a beguiling professor who instantly captivates the girls with a dazzling smile. This display elicits scowls from the boys. With a flair for the dramatic, the professor taps on a cage, revealing it to be filled with tiny, mischievous blue creatures—pixies. As he opens the cage door, the pixies burst forth in a chaotic swarm, wreaking havoc as they tear up books and seize Neville Longbottom by his ears, carrying him aloft across the room. The students flail helplessly at the pixies, who deftly hang Neville from the light fitting by his cloak. The air is thick with torn pages and flying pixies, one of which begins pulling at Hermione's hair until Harry swiftly swats it away.\n\nProfessor Lockhart attempts a spell to contain the chaos, but it proves futile as a pixie grabs his wand. The mayhem escalates when a dragon skeleton crashes to the floor in a clatter of bones and dust. Lockhart turns and flees up a flight of stairs, snatching a photo of himself from a pixie's grasp before looking down at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He then hastily exits, leaving the students to deal with the pandemonium. Hermione takes charge, pointing her wand and freezing the pixies mid-air, harmoniously suspending them. Neville, still dangling from the ceiling, looks down with a mournful expression.\n\nElsewhere, on the Quidditch pitch, Gryffindor captain Oliver Wood leads his team out for an early morning practice, only to spot the Slytherin team already present. Ron turns to Hermione, and Draco Malfoy steps forward, his eyes narrowing as he glares at Hermione. Appalled, Ron reaches for his wand but is suddenly propelled backwards. Laughter from the Slytherins fills the air as Ron looks ill, expelling a huge slug followed by another. Harry and Hermione rush to assist Ron, Colin snapping a photo, as the Slytherins laugh while watching them depart.\n\nLater, in the cozy warmth of Hagrid's cottage, the half-giant hands Ron a wooden bucket, his expression serious. Hermione, her eyes brimming with tears, gives Hagrid a faint smile as she walks away thoughtfully.\n\nIn Gilderoy Lockhart's room, the celebrity professor autographs a picture of himself, suddenly appearing confused as Harry hears a strange voice echoing through the space. Both professor and student scan the room nervously. Leaving Lockhart's room, Harry is halted by the voice again, seemingly coming from the stone walls. He follows the sound and bumps into Ron and Hermione, who hurry after him. As Harry leads the way into a wide corridor, he suddenly stops his friends, and they glance down in surprise. At their feet, a line of spiders marches in an orderly procession, captivating their attention.",
    "1120": "In the gripping opening sequence, tiny creatures scurry across the floor, scale the wall, and escape through a cracked windowpane. Meanwhile, a mysterious pool of water mirrors writing scrawled on the wall above. Harry's gaze shifts to a cat, rigid and suspended from a lamp by its tail. Students, drawn by the commotion, gather at the corridor's ends, their eyes darting between the peculiar scene and Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who stand conspicuously nearby.\n\nColin, eager to document the moment, is thwarted by an unseen someone. Draco, seizing the opportunity, recites the wall's inscription aloud. Filch, the cantankerous caretaker, elbows his way through the onlookers, his eyes wide at the sight of his cat, hanging lifeless. In a fit of rage, he seizes Harry. Dumbledore, surveying the scene, acknowledges the trio with a grave nod. Lockhart, ever the eccentric, gawks at the cat, while Ron shoots Hermione a cautionary glance. Snape, ever skeptical, looks far from convinced by the unfolding events.\n\nLater, the grand staircases swing and shift, repositioning before the students' eyes. As they ascend, Hermione turns to Ron and Harry, her expression serious. A nearby portrait nods in silent agreement with her unspoken words. In the classroom, a spell gone awry sees Ron transform Scabbers into a goblet, the rat's tail still flailing. Professor McGonagall, usually so assured, seems unsettled as she regards her expectant students. Hermione's brow furrows with concern, while Ron squares off against a smirking Draco.\n\nRetreating to the library, Hermione selects a tome from the shelves, sharing its contents with Ron and Harry. The action then shifts to the Quidditch pitch, where towering spectator stands, adorned with heraldic banners, encircle the oval arena. Players on broomsticks dart overhead, the crowd's excitement palpable. The Slytherin captain's attempt on goal is thwarted by the Gryffindor Keeper, but a swift pass sees the Quaffle soar through the hoop moments later, sending Slytherin supporters into raptures.\n\nProfessors applaud as the Slytherin captain rallies his team, their green cloaks billowing behind them like victory banners. Harry, narrowly avoiding a rogue bludger, scans the arena for the Golden Snitch, his counterpart Draco doing the same nearby. A sudden warning cry from his captain sends Harry wheeling away, just as a bludger smashes his teammate's broomstick to splinters. Hagrid, spectating through binoculars, watches in horror as the rogue bludger zeroes in on Harry, hot on his tail. Chaos ensues as a second bludger demolishes a tall tower, sending debris raining down onto the pitch.",
    "1127": "In the heart-wrenching opening scene, Hermione crouches low, drawing a circle in the air with her wand, from which a wreath of white roses materializes. Meanwhile, Harry, overcome with emotion, wipes his nose on his sleeve as he gazes intently at a grave. Sensing his distress, Hermione gently rests her head on his shoulder to comfort him. Suddenly, she notices a dark figure lurking nearby. Harry, too, sees an elderly woman clad in a knitted cape with a hood, who then turns and slowly walks away. Intrigued, they follow her up the street until Harry pauses beside the charred remains of a roofless house, recalling the harrowing memory of Voldemort's attack and the lifeless bodies left in its wake. His joy from a previous thought seems to cement his resolve.\n\nTurning around, they find the old woman, Bathilda, standing close to them. Harry approaches her, and she stares deeply into his eyes. Inside her dark house, she hands him a matchbox to light a candle, her wizened face scrutinizing his features. Harry's attention is abruptly drawn to something behind her as she turns to Hermione. Holding up the match, he examines a framed photograph of the young thief who had stolen Gregorovitch's Elder Wand. Bathilda, picking up the candle, shuffles past him, leaving Hermione anxious in the filthy living room.\n\nAs Harry follows Bathilda upstairs, the tip of his wand illuminates his path. Downstairs, Hermione's wand also glows as she discovers a book with a note attached. Flipping it over, she finds a moving picture of a smirking Rita Skeeter on the cover. Upstairs, Harry enters a dingy bedroom where Bathilda awaits, her eyes fixed on the locket around his neck. She gestures towards something across the room, but as Harry examines a photograph album, Bathilda's face contorts hideously, becoming cadaverous. She suddenly disintegrates, revealing her true form as a horrifying creature.\n\nDownstairs, Hermione ventures into another dark room, her wand's light disturbing a swarm of buzzing flies. She spots blood on the ceiling just as the snake lunges at Harry upstairs. Fending it off with a chair, Harry is hurled through a brick wall into a child's bedroom. The snake wraps around him, but he grabs a brick from the rubble and smashes the snake's head. As it slithers off, Harry hauls himself back through the broken wall. Hermione rushes upstairs, only to be attacked again by the relentless snake. With a flourish of her wand, she strikes it down, sending it tumbling down the stairs. Exhausted, Harry's wand lies at the top of the stairs, dropped during the struggle.",
    "1129": "In the thrilling opening, Harry desperately struggles with a chain that drags him beneath the surface of an icy lake. Panicked and choking, he is disoriented, unable to locate the opening through which he fell. He frantically pounds the underside of the ice with his hands and kicks at it with his bare feet, his strength waning. Above him, a shadowy figure traverses the ice. Harry's movements begin to slow, his eyes fluttering closed as the mysterious figure enters the water behind him. A hand reaches out and grasps the sword Harry carries. He is then pulled across the ice and propped against a fallen tree, the figure still clutching the sword as they move away.\n\nRegaining some strength, Harry leans forward and retrieves his glasses. Through them, he sees Ron standing before him, drenched and staring awkwardly at the ground. Harry places a locket on the fallen tree. Ron, gathering his resolve, causes the locket to spring open. Immediately, Harry and Ron are thrown to the ground as a menacing black cloud swirls overhead, materializing into a swarm of spiders. Ghostly apparitions of Harry and Hermione appear, speaking to Ron, who watches in growing anger as the spectral figures of Harry and Hermione share a passionate kiss. Consumed by jealousy, Ron charges at Harry with the Sword of Gryffindor, but instead of harming him, he strikes the locket, causing the dark visions to vanish.\n\nExhausted, Ron falls to his knees, releasing the sword. Harry sits beside him, concerned. Meanwhile, Hermione awakens and exits the tent, her expression stern as she approaches the pair. Harry gestures towards Ron, smiling, and Ron manages a broad grin in return. Hermione, however, is not amused; she storms over and snatches the rucksack from Ron's shoulder, her glare unyielding. Ron weakly holds up the open locket, glancing at Harry before looking away, a faint smile playing on his lips. Hermione, arms folded, remains resolute.\n\nLater, inside the tent, Ron and Harry watch a flickering flame in a jar, Hermione sitting outside. Harry takes the jar, the flame briefly flaring before dying out. Hermione, ignoring Ron, rushes past him to show Harry Rita’s book, her focus entirely on Harry. Ron, crestfallen, lowers his hand as Hermione walks away, leaving him standing shoulder to shoulder with her but feeling utterly disconnected.\n\nThe scene shifts to a vast, open heathland with rolling hills in the distance. Ron trudges ahead of Hermione and Harry, leading them to a crooked, solitary house where plums float in the air like orange balloons. The top half of the door creaks open, revealing Xenophilius, who peers out cautiously. Harry steps forward, and soon they are all seated inside a cluttered room, each holding a mug. In unison, they raise their mugs and drink. Xenophilius then holds up a mysterious pendant, leaving Harry to glance blankly at his friends before turning his attention back to Luna's father, awaiting an explanation.",
    "1130": "In a dimly lit room, Hermione locates the correct page in a book, her eyes scanning intently, while Xenophilius gazes absentmindedly out of a window. Suddenly, animated shadow puppets dance across the walls, illustrating a silent tale. Xenophilius tears himself away from the window and finds a scrap of paper. Picking up a pen, he draws a straight vertical line, pausing briefly to sweep back his long, unkempt hair before adding a circle that encloses the lower half of a wand. Finally, he completes the illustration with a triangle that encases both the wand and a stone. Harry, observing, nods in understanding, while Hermione watches anxiously.\n\nXenophilius, seemingly distracted, begins to inspect an old teapot before hurriedly descending a winding staircase. Meanwhile, Ron collects his rucksack, and together they discover Xenophilius by a window, whispering incoherently to himself. In a panic, he darts to the front door, holding it firmly shut, his face a picture of desperation as he turns to them. The trio stare back, nonplussed. With a trembling hand over his heart, Xenophilius approaches Harry, brushing the hair from his forehead to expose the iconic lightning-bolt scar. He locks eyes with Harry, his gaze intense.\n\nSimultaneously, Death Eaters streak towards the house, their menacing forms cutting through the sky. Harry, Hermione, and Ron dive to the floor as spells rebound off the building. Xenophilius dashes outside but is promptly struck down. Inside, the three friends join hands and vanish with a soft pop. Almost instantaneously, the house is obliterated.\n\nThey reappear in the heart of a dense forest. Ron strides past Hermione but halts abruptly as a stranger rises before him. Three more figures materialize, and Scabior, a notorious Snatcher, leans casually against a nearby tree, having detected Hermione's perfume. She spins on her heel and flees, Ron and Harry hot on her heels, their bags abandoned. About half a dozen Snatchers give chase, Scabior included. They gain ground, their wands firing relentlessly.\n\nHarry risks a glance backwards, stumbling and barely regaining his footing. Scabior pursues Hermione single-mindedly, while a Snatcher takes aim at Ron. A chain shoots from the wand, ensnaring Ron's legs and sending him crashing to the ground. Meanwhile, a young Snatcher closes in on Harry, who ducks beneath a fallen tree, only to find another adversary blocking his path. He stumbles, recovers, and presses on.\n\nHermione, dodging a chain that wraps around a nearby tree, fires a powerful explosive spell, felling a Snatcher. Yet another assailant appears, causing her to wheel around and train her wand on Harry. He collapses, his glasses askew, as a disfiguring spell warps his features. A Snatcher approaches, kicking Harry's wand away, while Scabior advances on Hermione, his wand at the ready. He paused to study Harry.",
    "1124": "In the eerie silence, a pair of staring eyes linger. Meanwhile, Rufus Scrimgeour and the Minister of Magic face the press, their photograph taken at a bustling conference. Back at home, Hermione Granger scans the headlines of the Daily Prophet, engrossed in the latest news. Concurrently, Harry Potter's Uncle Vernon lugs a heavy suitcase to his car, preparing for a journey. Harry watches this scene unfold from his bedroom window, his gaze fixed on the activity below.\n\nThe scene shifts to the rebuilt Weasley residence, where Ron stands pensively by the wreath beds, his eyes fixed on the horizon. Inside, Mrs. Weasley and Ginny are busy in the kitchen, the clatter of pots and pans filling the air. Ron briefly glances behind him before turning back to the wreath beds, lost in thought.\n\nIn Hermione's home, her parents are engrossed in a television program. She looks at them with a heavy heart and raises her wand, its tip beginning to glow. Slowly, images of Hermione as a baby and young child fade from the photographs on the mantelpiece. Tears well up in her eyes as she sees herself disappearing from every photograph in the house.\n\nBack at the Dursleys, Aunt Petunia sits in the car, her expression blank. Uncle Vernon nervously scans the sky, while Dudley clambers into the backseat. Harry stands alone on the path, watching as they drive away. Hermione, standing outside her front door, takes one last look back before walking down the path and striding off along the street, her long wavy hair ruffled by a breeze, a small beaded bag in hand.\n\nA dark, shadowy figure—a Death Eater—zooms over the countryside, descending towards a grand manor house on a sprawling estate. Landing, the figure strides towards the gates and, with a wave of his wand, makes them evaporate, allowing him to step through. His face somber, dark hair lank and shoulder-length, the gates reappear behind him.\n\nIn a stark storeroom, Snape ascends a flight of stairs, entering a room where people are seated at a long table before a blazing fire. At the table's end, a woman hangs horizontally in mid-air. Snape takes a seat close to Lord Voldemort, a massive snake slithering beside Pius Thicknesse. Voldemort turns to Snape, and the woman shrinks back in fear. Passing behind the Malfoys, Lucius turns, his face twitching as he reaches for his wand. His hand shaking, he holds it out to Voldemort, who runs his fingers over it before snapping off the handle. Snape watches intently as Voldemort discards the wand handle. Lucius trembles as Voldemort points the wand at the floating woman, who pleads with Snape to no avail. With a flick of the wand, the woman falls dead onto the table. Draco Malfoy winces, and a single tear falls from Charity's eye. Voldemort gently strokes the snake, which glides onto the table and slithers towards the dead woman, its tongue flickering and mouth wide open.\n\nIn a grim finale, Albus Dumbledore plummets from the astronomy tower, the white-haired professor floating gently downwards, a haunting image against the night sky.",
    "1133": "In the opening moments of the movie, a bus and a lorry approach each other, setting the scene for the chaos that is about to unfold. Hagrid, in a daring stunt, rides upside down on the roof of a tunnel, while Harry, clinging to the sidecar of a motorbike, momentarily leaves his seat and skims over the bus before dropping back in as the bike returns to the road. Suddenly, Hagrid is hit by a bolt from a Death Eater and slumps forward, injured.\n\nHarry reactively grabs the handlebars, steering the motorbike skyward. Hedwig, the loyal owl, bravely attacks the pursuing Death Eater but is tragically struck down by a bolt of green light, tumbling to the earth. The Death Eater retreats briefly, but another sinister figure closes in, causing Harry to cry out in pain as his jagged scar lights up. The motorbike races between towering electric pylons, and Harry's wand begins to glow on its own.\n\nThe dark figure draws near, and a powerful surge of energy connects Harry's wand with his adversary's. The pulsating force travels up Voldemort’s wand, revealing his face in a burst of light. An explosion rocks the motorbike, sending flames spewing out as Harry hits a control button and the bike zooms away, propelling Voldemort backward. The electric pylons collapse dramatically.\n\nHarry, Hagrid, and the bike soar upward, breaking through the cloud layer. As Hagrid regains consciousness and takes control of the motorbike, the engine fails, and they plummet back toward the ground, careening into a bumpy landing in a reed bed. Soaked by a spray of water, Harry and Hagrid exchange a look before trudging toward the Weasley's home.\n\nMolly Weasley hears the commotion as they crash through the protective shield around the house. Ginny follows her mother out to see the arrival, accompanied by Lupin, who is supporting a bloodied George. George is rushed inside and laid on a sofa, his injuries grimly apparent. In a moment of tension, Lupin grabs Harry by the collar, pinning him against the fireplace, before stepping back and nodding. As Lupin exits, Kingsley and Hermione arrive, their wands poised briefly at each other before lowering them.\n\nA thestral carrying Bill and Fleur lands nearby, and Nymphadora Tonks approaches with another Harry lookalike, who transforms back into Ron. Emotions run high as Hermione rushes to embrace Ron, and Lupin embraces Nymphadora. Harry runs to hug Hermione and Ron, just as Mr. Weasley returns with Fred, who anxiously joins the others.\n\nMrs. Weasley tenderly strokes George's brow while Fred kneels beside his twin, the gathered crowd stunned by the sight of George's severe ear wound. Bill steps forward, his expression grave. The room falls silent, the weight of the situation settling on everyone as they look at each other in shock and disbelief.",
    "1135": "In the bustling wedding reception, the Minister's gaze shifts from Harry to Ron, then to Hermione. Soft light pours from the marquis, where a group of men stand guard outside. Lupin casually walks past them, while Harry, standing in the covered walkway, grasps a hovering Snitch and tucks it into his jacket pocket before entering the marquis. Inside, Fleur and Bill dance gracefully, surrounded by fluttering butterflies, as Harry smiles at the magical sight of Champagne glasses filling themselves. Nearby, Madame Maxime towers over an admiring Hagrid, and a man with striking long white blonde hair dances dramatically with Luna Lovegood, catching Ron's stare. Hermione appears, radiant in a sleeveless red dress, just as Harry notices Elphias Doge and moves to join him. Luna's father is noticeable by his peculiar pendant, a triangle with a circle and vertical line. As Harry sits with Elphias, an old woman scowls, leaving Harry puzzled.\n\nA sudden bright white light in the sky interrupts the festivities. Harry rises, fixated on the approaching light as the guests draw back in alarm. The light bursts into the marquis, projecting images and voices that leave the guests frozen. As quickly as they appeared, the images vanish, and Bill comforts a shaken Fleur. Elphias disappears just as Death Eaters arrive, launching an attack on the guests. Amidst the chaos, Ron grabs Hermione, and Harry rushes towards Ginny, only to be halted by Lupin. In an instant, Harry, Hermione, and Ron apparate to London, with Ron and Harry holding Hermione's hands.\n\nThey follow Hermione through Piccadilly Circus and down a crowded street into a dingy alley, where they change clothes from Hermione's bottomless handbag. Inside a cafe, a surly waitress wearing earphones takes their order, oblivious to the danger lurking. Two men enter, prompting Hermione to indicate her bag just as the men fire their wands. In the ensuing battle, one man falls, and Hermione and Ron aim at the second, who misses his target and is ultimately defeated by Hermione. The waitress, emerging from the kitchen, gapes at the scene and scurries back. Ron uses the Deluminator to absorb the light from the lamps, and Hermione uses her wand to lower the shutters, securing their safety.\n\nHermione approaches the dark-haired man in overalls lying stiffly on the floor, her wand tip glowing as she checks for signs of life. Dolohov's eyes remain open and staring, confirming their fears. Later, they walk through a covered arcade, and Hermione suddenly stops as they reach Grimmauld Place. Number 12, a tall terraced house, slides into position, and they enter the Black family home, their journey far from over.",
    "1139": "Harry plunges into a fireplace and is swiftly swept away. Hermione and Ron hastily follow, with Yaxley in hot pursuit. Mid-flight, Yaxley seizes them, causing their faces to twist in distress, but ultimately loses his grip. Sunlight pierces through a dense canopy of leaves as Harry, still clad in Albert's clothes, awakens on a bed of dead leaves in a forest. Spotting the locket nearby, he eagerly sheds Albert's coat and rushes to retrieve it. Meanwhile, Hermione tends to Ron, who is shivering and nursing a severe wound on his left shoulder. Harry frantically searches their bag, using his wand to summon a bottle of healing essence. Hermione administers a few drops, causing the wound to close, and sighs in relief, her hands stained with blood. She steps away as Harry takes her place by Ron's side.\n\nBracing herself, Hermione raises her wand. Inside a small, dimly lit tent, Harry aims his wand at the locket, causing smoke to billow from it. The trio approaches the locket, which lies untouched amidst the dead leaves, Ron's left arm supported in a sling. Hermione attempts to destroy it, engulfing the locket in flames, but it remains unscathed and is forcefully thrown across the clearing. Ron, appearing weary and unwell, gazes at it, while Harry glares angrily as the flames extinguish, leaving the locket firmly closed. Undeterred, Harry picks it up, slips the chain over his head, and tucks the locket inside his shirt. Hermione casts an anxious look at Harry, who responds with a stern glance before abruptly walking away.\n\nOutside the tent, Harry examines a shard of broken mirror, suddenly whirling around as a radio is tuned inside. He spots Hermione in a hollow, lifts the locket, and connects with Voldemort, who is interrogating the wandmaker, Gregorovitch. A boy thief flees with a wand, leaving Gregorovitch cowering before Voldemort delivers a fatal blow. Harry gasps, drawing Hermione's concern. Glaring at the tent, Harry storms off, struggling to remove the locket and chain, which he then hands to Hermione. She inspects it carefully before walking away, leaving Harry with his head bowed. Later, Hermione keeps watch by a campfire in front of the tent. Alert, she stands upon hearing a noise, as Harry, resting his head on a table inside, awakens and checks on the still-sleeping Ron.",
    "1145": "In the gripping sequence of events, Cedric enters the maze through a different entrance, much like Harry, bewildered, he dashes along the narrow, labyrinthine paths carved between the meticulously trimmed hedges. Pausing with indecision, Cedric selects a route only to have it slam shut before him. The hedges on either side entwine, trapping him. Despite the branches thrashing against his face, he battles his way through the densening barrier.\n\nMeanwhile, Viktor trudges steadily, wand in hand, his eyes eerily glazed over. Harry, alert, spins at the sound of footsteps, while Fleur, panicked, races between the hedges, finding only dead ends. Her face, slick with fear, she stares down the foggy path, turning as she hears a noise. A chilling scream echoes, and Harry bolts towards it, spotting Viktor leaning over a fallen, dazed Fleur. Sinister roots slither from the hedge towards her, and as Viktor moves on, cloudy-eyed and oblivious to Harry, she is dragged under by the writhing tendrils.\n\nHarry sends red sparks exploding into the sky, signaling danger. A fierce wind whips the branches, kicking up dust and leaves, as the hedges begin to close in, pushing Harry forward. Diving through a narrowing gap, he spots a gleaming object and emerges between Cedric and Viktor. Cedric swiftly disarms Viktor, but Harry intervenes, only to be shrugged off as Cedric resumes his race. Harry gives chase, and the two grapple, each fighting for the lead.\n\nSuddenly, the Triwizard Trophy sparkles through the mist. In their final sprint, Cedric is barely ahead, but roots snaking from the hedge send him crashing down. Harry takes the lead but halts, seeing Cedric ensnared and struggling. The roots constrict around Cedric's neck, threatening to strangle him. Harry, torn between the trophy and Cedric's plight, raises his wand, breaking the deadly hold of the roots and saving Cedric from the sinister grasp.",
    "1146": "In a burst of courage, Harry rushes to Cedric's side, helping him break free from his constrains. Exhausted and shaking, Harry gets back on his feet as a powerful gust of wind whirls leaves through the air and the hedges begin to advance menacingly. With the hedges closing in behind them, they dash towards the gleaming trophy. Pausing briefly before it, they grasp it together, each with one hand. Instantly, it spins like a Catherine wheel, and they are swiftly deposited next to a statue in a cemetery, the cold moonlight casting eerie shadows across the graveyard.\n\nCedric surveys the moonlit scene as the trophy lies discarded on the ground. Suddenly, Harry clutches his forehead, overwhelmed by a wave of agony. Wormtail materializes, cradling a small, withered creature bundled in a blanket. Cedric, wand at the ready, stands defensively but is swiftly struck down, falling lifeless to the ground. Wormtail, with a flick of his wand, compels Harry upward, where he is ensnared by the stone arms of the statue, pinned behind the scythe's handle.\n\nA large cauldron stands ominously before Harry as Wormtail deposits the feeble creature into it. Wormtail then proceeds to open the Riddle family grave, retrieving a bone which he tosses into the cauldron. Drawing a knife, he callously severes his own right hand, adding it to the grim concoction. He then slices Harry's sleeve, cutting his arm and letting his blood drip into the cauldron. The cauldron's contents churn and bubble ominously. Wormtail retreats into the shadows as flames erupt high into the night, and the cauldron vanishes from sight.\n\nA gruesome, formless figure writhes before Harry, gradually taking human shape as a black, smoky veil envelops and reveals it. Voldemort turns his head slowly, his gray skin taut against his skeletal features, eyes sunken, and nostrils mere slits. He traces his fingers over his bald skull, savoring his restored form. Wormtail reemerges from the shadows, presenting Voldemort with his robe. Draped in black, Voldemort extends his arms triumphantly, a chilling smile on his thin lips. Wormtail bows low, offering something to his master. Voldemort takes it with his long, bony fingers and presses his wand into the dark mark on Wormtail's arm, gazing up at the darkening sky.\n\nFrom the clouds, a ribbon of black smoke descends, twisting and dividing into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed Death Eater, their faces concealed by tall pointed hoods and skeleton masks. As the smoke dissipates, Voldemort faces his followers, removing their masks to reveal their identities. They kneel before him, and Lucius, ripping off his hood, has his hand restored in silver. Voldemort turns his attention to Harry, pressing a finger into the scar on his forehead, sending him crashing to the ground in agony. Harry tries to resist, but Voldemort forces him to bow, sending him spinning.\n\nSummoning every last bit of bravery, Harry faces Voldemort, prepared for the inevitable confrontation.",
    "1140": "In the darkness, a metallic shield bearing the letters WB steadily advances. Behind grim iron railings, a mountain of skulls and bones looms. A large snake emerges from the grinning jaws of a skull, its forked tongue flickering as it silently winds between gravestones in a dark, overgrown cemetery. The snake's sleek body shimmers as it swiftly navigates the jagged path, slipping past a stone statue of a winged skeleton draped in a hooded cloak, wielding a scythe. Metallic silver letters materialize in the gloomy sky, as a vast, decrepit house is silhouetted against the night.\n\nNearby, a light flicks on in a small cottage. Within, a disheveled elderly man ignites a gas stove and sets a kettle to boil. As he prepares his tea, he spots a light in the grand house through the kitchen window. Startled, he discards the tea bag, grabs a bunch of keys, and exits the cottage, large torch lighting his way. The old man traverses the rugged terrain towards the grand house, hauling himself up the stone steps to the imposing wooden door.\n\nInside, his torch beam dances over dust-laden wooden panels and a cobweb-covered grandfather clock. He ascends the bare stairs, gripping the wooden banister, as eerie shadows play on the paneled walls. Suddenly, he extinguishes his torch upon hearing voices from an open doorway. Unnoticed, the snake slithers into the room, advancing towards an obscured figure seated in an armchair. Abruptly, the old man is engulfed in a burst of vivid green light.\n\nBack in the cottage, the kettle whistles as it reaches boiling point. Harry startles awake, while Ron collapses back onto his pillow. Meanwhile, Mr. Weasley guides his group through a dense wood. A boy descends from above, and together they scale a grassy incline as dawn breaks. They all touch a boot that spins like a Catherine wheel, accelerating until they're pulled into a blinding light.\n\nGinny, Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the twins release their grips, landing heavily on the ground. Looking up, Harry sees Mr. Diggory, Cedric, and Mr. Weasley descending calmly to earth. Cedric lends Harry a hand, and they follow the others along a cliffside overlooking the sea. As the sun ascends, they gaze down upon an enormous campsite teeming with activity.\n\nBelow, jugglers captivate the crowd as more tents are pitched, and people swoop dangerously low on broomsticks. Mr. Weasley leads them to an unimposing two-man tent. Harry stares in awe as he enters the deceptively tiny tent, revealing a vast interior adorned with carpets, beds, and sofas.",
    "1149": "In the vibrant gap between the clouds, a grand coach materializes, pulled by seven magnificent winged white horses. Students gather excitedly in the school cloisters, their eyes fixed on the sky as the coach descends towards them. Under Hagrid's careful guidance, the horses touch down gently, though Hagrid himself narrowly avoids being struck as the coach flies low over his head.\n\nMeanwhile, a tall mast bearing a slender pennant emerges from the heart of the lake. A colossal, golden galleon ascends gracefully to the surface, water cascading from its decks. Unfurling its massive sails, the ship advances smoothly towards the school. Inside, Filch, the caretaker, rushes breathlessly down the hall to whisper urgent news to Professor Dumbledore before darting out again.\n\nA parade of elegant girls sweeps into the hall, their dance-like movements captivating the onlookers. Clad in blue silk uniforms that accentuate their slim figures, they are accompanied by tiny bluebirds fluttering around them. Ron watches, mesmerized by the sight, while Seamus stares in awe as the towering figure of Madame Maxime, standing over eight feet tall, strides past. She dwarfs Professor Dumbledore as the visitors perform a graceful curtsy. Madame Maxime, her face framed by an enormous fur collar, smiles warmly and extends her hand, which Dumbledore gallantly kisses.\n\nIn a dramatic entrance, the Durmstrang students march into the hall, their Slavic military-style uniforms and long staffs commanding attention. Sparks fly as they twirl their staffs and strike the stone floor, with two students hurdling forward in high-flying somersaults. Among them, a handsome student with close-cropped hair catches Ron's eye—it's his Quidditch hero. Another student blows an impressive ring of fire, adding to the spectacle. High Master Karkaroff, dressed in a long white coat and a Russian hat, steps forward to greet Dumbledore.\n\nAmidst a raging storm, a dark, disheveled figure limps through the rain towards Hogwarts. Inside, chaos ensues as Hagrid accidentally stabs Professor Flitwick's hand. Dumbledore steps forward just as Barty Crouch rises, and a mysterious figure limps into the hall. Lightning flashes from the enchanted ceiling, but the figure raises his wand, causing the lightning to retreat. Ron recognizes the man as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, his scarred face and erratically swiveling false eye unmistakable. Moody's metal boot clangs against the floor as he takes a swig from his hip flask.\n\nMr. Crouch nervously addresses the students, while Dumbledore reveals an ancient stone goblet hidden within an ornate, jeweled cabinet. A bright blue flame leaps from the goblet's mouth, continuing to burn steadily. Outside, the Durmstrang galleon strains against its moorings, the blue flame flickering eerily in the great hall.\n\nIgor Karkaroff enters the room cautiously, carefully closing the door behind him. Moody begins his lesson, writing on the blackboard before approaching the students. Ron looks petrified, while Hermione appears apprehensive. Moody removes the lid from a glass jar, scooping out a spider. With a flick of his wand, the spider grows larger, capturing the students' terrified attention.",
    "1155": "In the halls of Hogwarts, Viktor Krum saunters by, clad in a singlet, with a cluster of giggling girls trailing behind him. Hermione watches the scene, flustered. Meanwhile, in class, Ron leans in to whisper something to Harry, but their stealthy exchange is interrupted when Snape sharply clips Ron's ear. Undeterred, Ron's mischief continues as Fred passes him a note, which Fred then playfully throws at Angelina. Fred gestures to Angelina, mimicking a dance and pointing to himself, earning a thumbs up from her. With a wink at Ron, Fred's antics are halted when Snape strikes both Ron and Harry with a book.\n\nIn the tense classroom, a student stands up, hands her book to Snape, and returns to her seat before storming off, prompting Snape to strike the boys again. Outside, a tranquil blanket of snow drapes over Hogwarts. Harry, with his hands buried deep in his pockets, dashes up the stone steps to the owlery, pausing to stamp the snow off his boots. At the door, he narrowly avoids colliding with Cho. They awkwardly sidestep each other, and Harry swallows hard, visibly nervous. Later, Harry lies moodily in the common room, clutching the golden egg, as Ron is led in by Ginny. Harry chases after Parvati and Padma, his thoughts consumed by the upcoming Yule Ball.\n\nThe evening of the Yule Ball arrives, and the Durmstrang galleon glows with lights on the frozen lake. Excited students gather at the entrance to the Great Hall, the girls elegantly dressed in long gowns and the boys in dress robes. In his room, Ron adjusts his worn robe, gazing at himself in the mirror. Harry enters, dressed in a sleek black robe and white bow tie, nervously sniffing his armpit before checking his appearance in the mirror.\n\nOn the grand staircase, Ron hurriedly escorts Padma away, though she follows reluctantly. Harry spots Cho with Cedric, but his attention shifts as he sees Hermione descend the stairs like a princess in a pink gown, her hair softly curled. She smiles shyly at him. Krum, resplendent in his dress uniform with a fur-trimmed cloak, clicks his heels and bows to Hermione. Taking his arm, she gives Harry an excited wave.\n\nThe immense doors of the Great Hall swing open, revealing the Triwizard competitors and their partners processing in. Harry walks stiffly beside Parvati, his face a mask of apprehension. Padma stares at Hermione, captivated by her transformation. Snow gently falls from the enchanted ceiling as Parvati, clutching Harry's arm, waves to her friends. Harry clutches her waist, allowing Parvati to guide him around the dance floor. He lifts her awkwardly into the air, swinging her around clumsily.\n\nAmong the dancing couples, Dumbledore elegantly leads Professor McGonagall onto the dance floor, while Filch dances with his cat. Krum swings Hermione high into the air, and Cedric dances past with Cho. Neville confidently takes to the floor with Ginny, spinning her around with ease. In an alcove, Mad-Eye Moody, exposing his metal leg, sits wearing a kilt and a ferret sporran. He takes a swig from his hip flask and shudders. Beside him, Hagrid sidles over to the towering Madame Maxime, giving her a playful wink and gesturing towards the dance floor.",
    "1158": "In the throes of departure, a man pauses as Snape turns back, eyebrows raised inquisitively. Umbridge, resolved, raises her wand. The scene shifts abruptly to the eerie Forbidden Forest, where Harry reunites with Hermione. They discover the frayed remnant of Gwarp's rope strewn across the forest floor, while Umbridge appears dirty and disheveled. Amongst the dense trees, shadowy creatures materialize, armed with bows and arrows. Umbridge steps back, visibly nervous, wagging a cautionary finger. One creature collapses, a strangling rope tight around its throat, thrashing in agony. Hermione rushes to free it, but Umbridge is lifted high by Gwarp. Swift retribution follows as centaurs storm in, firing arrows and ultimately grabbing Umbridge, carrying her away.\n\nHarry and Hermione dash back through the forest towards Hogwarts, met by Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron. United, they soar above the pine forest astride a thestral, its leathery back beneath them. Harry grips tightly, glancing at his companions, with Luna close behind, smiling happily. The thestrals press on through the stormy night, battling strong winds, until the familiar lights of Canary Wharf and the winding River Thames emerge below.\n\nThe group navigates the deserted Ministry of Magic, advancing cautiously along a corridor lined with shiny black tiles towards a blue door. Inside, a shadowy storeroom filled with towering wooden shelves reveals thousands of cloudy glass spheres. The door behind them slides away, and by the light of their wands, they search the long, dark passages. Neville reads a label beneath a sphere that begins to glow, its misty interior swirling. Harry retrieves it just as a masked Death Eater approaches. Lucius Malfoy unmasks himself, and dark figures close in, blocking the passages.\n\nIn a flurry of action, Luna is knocked down but swiftly retaliates, vanishing her attacker. Neville stuns a Death Eater, and Luna pulls him to safety. Hermione, pursued, flicks her wand, sending glass spheres crashing down onto their pursuers. The scene fades with the group fighting for their escape against the encroaching Death Eaters.",
    "1159": "In the gripping sequence of events, the friends reunite just as the menacing Death Eaters close in. Ginny swiftly points her wand, causing their attackers to vanish abruptly. The passages lie deserted, but suddenly, glass spheres begin to drop from the highest shelves, shattering into countless pieces. The friends look up, startled, as Luna becomes transfixed by the falling spheres. Neville swiftly grabs her arm, and they all start to run, more spheres plummeting around them. They dash towards a door at the end of a long, narrow passage, the wooden shelves collapsing behind them in a cascade of broken glass. Crunching the shards underfoot, they reach the door, push it open, and rush through, only to find themselves falling into empty space.\n\nThey land face down beside a large rocky mound, with Harry still clutching a glowing sphere. A stone archway filled with misty vapor looms on the mound. Raising their wands defensively, they confront a swooping group of black-cloaked Death Eaters, who swirl around them, trailing plumes of dense black smoke. Harry huddles on the rocky mound, gripping the prophecy sphere tightly. He cautiously stands up, facing a scowling Death Eater who restrains Luna, his wand pressed against her throat. Harry looks around desperately, seeing each of his friends held captive by grim-faced Death Eaters. Ron struggles in vain, while Hermione's captor tightens his grip.\n\nLucius approaches Harry, his hand outstretched demandingly. Harry, seeing his friends helpless, reluctantly places the glowing prophecy into Lucius' hand. The sphere darkens, and Lucius holds it up in triumph. Suddenly, a flash of bright light startles Lucius. Sirius appears and punches Lucius, causing him to drop the sphere, which shatters instantly. The Death Eaters release their captives, and Bellatrix disappears.\n\nFlashes of light bring reinforcements, including Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley, and Lupin. A Death Eater advances menacingly, but Sirius fends him off and pulls Harry to safety. Nymphadora aids Luna and Hermione, while Lucius draws a wand from his stick, aimed at Harry. A Death Eater joins Lucius, and together, Sirius and Harry fight them off in front of the stone archway. Above, Death Eaters swoop, trailing black smoke. One heads for Moody, who taps his stick, sending the Death Eater hurtling away.\n\nSirius congratulates Harry and disarms Lucius, sending him flying backward. But Bellatrix attacks, and Sirius staggers. He gives Harry a faint smile before being drawn away through the stone archway, absorbed into the swirling, misty vapor beyond. Sirius is gone, leaving a distraught Harry trying to follow.",
    "1160": "Lupin restrains Harry tightly, but Harry's grief morphs into fury as he spots Bellatrix Lestrange's malicious grin. She swiftly vanishes around a dark corner, prompting Harry to break away from Lupin and pursue her. Catching up to her in the grand hall of the Ministry of Magic, he casts a spell that sends her tumbling to the ground, where she cowers as Harry stands over her, wand aimed and ready. His neck tenses, and he pauses, gripping his wand tighter. Suddenly, Voldemort materializes, disarming Harry with a flick of his wand and a flash of green smoke.\n\nJust then, Dumbledore emerges from a fireplace, pushing Harry aside as Bellatrix vanishes in another flash of green smoke. Voldemort strikes first, but Dumbledore retaliates, their wands emitting red and green light respectively. The powerful forces collide in a spectacular burst of sparks and flame, like molten lava erupting. Harry recoils as Voldemort conjures a colossal serpent wreathed in red-hot flames, its fangs bared as it lunges towards Harry. Dumbledore intervenes, shielding Harry from the intense heat and summoning a vast wave of water from the nearby fountain, engulfing Voldemort within a gigantic, rolling ball of water.\n\nThough Voldemort bursts free, Dumbledore launches a powerful energy blast, sending Voldemort staggering backwards. Voldemort returns the blast, hurling Dumbledore through the air and shattering windows. Shards of glass tear apart a banner bearing Fudge's picture, and Voldemort, snarling, sends the jagged pieces flying towards Harry and Dumbledore. Dumbledore generates a force field, deflecting the glass and reducing it to fine sand. Undeterred, Voldemort disappears in a whirlwind of sand that ruffles Dumbledore's beard, and the sand on the floor begins to shudder, moving ominously towards Harry.\n\nHarry's body seizes and convulses as he collapses, his eyes dark-rimmed and staring. In agony, he glares at Dumbledore, haunted by painful memories—his mother, Cedric's lifeless body, Sirius fading away. Dumbledore kneels beside him, anxiety etched on his face, as Harry sees himself as Voldemort. Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron, and their companions enter the devastated hall, freezing in alarm at the sight of Dumbledore tending to Harry. Seeing his friends, Harry remembers happier times—his parents, joyful moments at Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron. Voldemort sneers, but the memory of love and friendship lingers.",
    "1156": "As the sun pierces through menacing storm clouds, it illuminates stark metal letters, setting the scene for a tense day in suburban London. The sun beats down mercilessly, creating a heat haze that blankets the area. Cars race along a dual carriageway adjacent to a parched, yellowed field where a forgotten playground sits in one corner. A teenage boy, Harry Potter, traverses this dry expanse, eventually finding himself in the playground, alone with his thoughts as he takes a seat on a swing.\n\nHis solitude is short-lived, as he spots his cousin Dudley approaching with his gang. Harry, feeling threatened, draws his wand and presses it to Dudley's throat. Meanwhile, the sky begins to darken, with heavy storm clouds gathering overhead and a strong wind kicking up, sending Dudley's gang scattering. As the cousins watch, the tempest intensifies, and they hurriedly seek shelter.\n\nHarry leads the way through a rough, muddy cart track, with Dudley—overweight and struggling—lagging behind. Drenched, they take refuge in a dim, graffiti-covered underpass, its grimy walls and flickering yellow lamps offering little comfort. As they catch their breath, the air grows colder, and their breaths become visible.\n\nSuddenly, a cloaked figure swoops in, seizing Harry. Dudley tries to flee but is tripped and dragged by an unseen force. A second, skeletal figure—a Dementor—floats above Dudley, while another attacks Harry, pinning him to the wall and attempting to suck the life out of him. Harry fights back, managing to strike his attacker with his wand and break free.\n\nFalling to the ground, Harry quickly recovers his wand and sends a blinding light towards his assailant, forcing it to retreat. He then turns his attention to the other Dementor, using his wand to banish it with a powerful blast of light. With both creatures vanquished, Harry rushes to Dudley's side, finding him semi-conscious and struggling to breathe.\n\nAn elderly woman enters the tunnel, causing Harry to conceal his wand hastily. She pauses, taking in the scene before her, but ultimately continues on her way. Harry, with no other option, half-carries the dazed Dudley home to number four Privet Drive, where Aunt Petunia is engrossed in the television, oblivious to their extraordinary ordeal.",
    "1162": "In the gloomy, cobweb-laden corridor, the aged tiles beneath their feet are fractured and filthy. Harry pauses in apprehension, but Moody brushes past him impatiently, followed by the rest of the group moving towards an open door at the far end. Nymphadora, turning briefly, winks playfully at Harry before tripping over an umbrella stand. Through the doorway, Harry glimpses Mr. Weasley, Sirius, and Lupin gathered together. As Nymphadora exits, closing the door behind her, she envelops Harry in a warm embrace, studying him closely with a mixture of concern and affection.\n\nSuddenly, a house elf appears on the landing, its spindly arms laboring to drag a wooden box. The creature, with its elongated nose, pointed ears, and tattered vest, casts a resentful glare at Harry. Climbing atop the box, the elf begins to polish a picture frame with meticulous care. Without warning, Harry opens a bedroom door and is nearly toppled by Hermione, with Ron standing just behind her. Harry's eyes widen as he surveys the room, taking in every detail. Meanwhile, the Weasley twins dangle a magical ear over the banister, only for Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, to bat it away and dash off with his prize. Fred and George give chase as Harry finds solace in the arms of his godfather, Sirius, who holds him tightly. Sirius's gaze locks onto Harry, and with a comforting wink, he ensures Harry feels his support.\n\nThat night, while Ron sleeps soundly, Harry's rest is plagued by fitful dreams. The next day, the group navigates the London Underground, descending on an escalator with Mr. Weasley clutching the handrails tightly. As they reach the bottom, Mr. Weasley steels himself and steps off, mimicking other passengers by placing his palm on the ticket reader. The gate remains stubbornly closed until Harry inserts a ticket, allowing Mr. Weasley to squeeze through backwards, his face lit with delight.\n\nEmerging onto the street, they enter a seemingly ordinary red telephone box, which promptly sinks beneath the pavement like an elevator. The interior transforms, revealing a passage that halts to discharge them into an expansive, tiled hall flanked by colossal fireplaces. People materialize from the fireplaces in flashes of green smoke, joining the bustling crowd of witches and wizards. Harry follows Mr. Weasley past an ornate fountain adorned with golden statues, his gaze drawn upward to a vast silken banner bearing the moving image of Cornelius Fudge, the Minister of Magic.\n\nCrowding into an antiquated lift with metal gates, they are surrounded by paper airplanes swooping overhead. Kingsley pushes into the lift, whispering urgently to Mr. Weasley. The gates clang shut, and the lift lurches backwards before plummeting downward, carrying them deeper into the mysterious recesses of the magical world beneath London.",
    "1173": "In the classroom next door, Harry materializes as he removes the invisibility cloak. The moonlight, streaming through the snow-kissed window panes, imbues the empty classroom with a mysterious ambiance. Harry surveys his surroundings with curiosity. Through a stone arch, he spots a large mirror with a carved frame, recessed into the room beyond. He approaches the mirror slowly, watching his reflection draw nearer. Pausing before it, he attempts to decipher the peculiar, unfamiliar words inscribed around the wooden frame.\n\nHarry stands transfixed, staring at his reflection. Suddenly, two shadowy figures materialize in the mirror, flanking him on either side—a young man and woman. Harry turns, but the room remains empty. He looks back at the pretty young woman, swallowing nervously as she nods and smiles. Beside her, Harry's kind-looking father beams at him. Harry reaches out, but his fingers meet only his reflection. As his mother rests her hand on the shoulder of his mirrored self, Harry mirrors the action, feeling a connection. She smiles at him fondly once more, and he gazes at her sadly.\n\nLater, Harry reveals Ron's bed by pulling off the cover. Back in the empty classroom, they remove the invisibility cloak and rush to the mirror. Harry sits alone on the stone floor, knees tucked under his chin, gazing into the mirror. Professor Dumbledore appears by the window, prompting Harry to stand.\n\nDressed in a warm black cloak and his red and gold Gryffindor scarf, Harry traverses the snow-covered courtyard with his pet white owl perched on his arm. The beautiful bird stretches its wings before Harry lifts his arm, allowing the owl to take flight. It soars above, swooping around the courtyard and ascending over the grey stone towers of the school until it vanishes into the snowy sky. Eventually, the white owl returns towards Hogwarts, passing the hoops of the Quidditch goal posts. The snow has thawed, revealing green grass, and fluffy white clouds float in the blue sky.\n\nIn the library, Hermione casts Ron a withering look before finding the right page in a book. Harry, Ron, and Hermione hasten across the wet grass towards a stone cottage nestled at the edge of the forest. Hagrid, wearing oven gloves, retrieves something from a pot hanging over the fire as he lets them in.",
    "1175": "In a flurry, they hurry to her desk, only to pause and gradually retreat, exiting into the corridor. There, Professor Snape fixes his gaze sternly on Harry before sweeping away, his dark cloak billowing dramatically behind him. The school stands stark against the moonlit night sky. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stealthily make their way downstairs to the common room, where they notice Neville's toad. Neville, startled, rises from his chair but abruptly freezes and topples backward. Leaving Neville, the trio clusters together under the invisibility cloak.\n\nHermione carefully unlocks the door on the third floor, revealing a harp that plays itself eerily. They shed the cloak and encounter a three-headed dog, deep in slumber. Working together, they gingerly shift the dog's massive paw from a trapdoor. As the beast exhales, they recoil, then heave open the wooden lid to reveal a dark pit below. Suddenly, drool from the dog splashes onto Ron, and the creature awakens, its three jaws gaping. Without hesitation, they plunge into the hole just as the dog demolishes the trapdoor.\n\nLanding on a strangely soft surface, they realize it's a plant that begins to writhe. Tendrils slither over them, ensnaring their limbs and necks. The boys wrestle to break free, but Hermione is abruptly pulled out of sight. Harry swiftly follows her, and she aims her wand, emitting a flash of light that dissolves the plant. Ron then tumbles down to join them, earning a concerned frown from Harry.\n\nThey proceed through a door into a chamber lined with sturdy stone pillars. Above, small winged objects dart about, and a worn broomstick hangs mid-air. Ron tries the locked door to no avail. Harry, examining the broomstick, nods and grasps it. Instantly, a swarm of metal keys buzzes menacingly around him. Undeterred, Harry mounts the broomstick and ascends, spotting a key with a broken wing. It darts upwards, but Harry pursues it, seizing the key as it veers back towards him. He tosses it to Hermione, who swiftly unlocks the door. The flying keys go berserk, chasing Harry like a swarm of bees, but Hermione and Ron push open the door, allowing Harry to zoom inside just as the door slams shut, leaving the keys to collide against it.\n\nThe next room is filled with eerie shadows and colossal, broken stone statues strewn across the floor. Ron, Harry, and Hermione enter cautiously, navigating the piles of shattered figures. Ron scans the room as torches blaze to life, illuminating a vast marble chessboard with massive black and white squares. Enormous stone chess pieces stand ready, and fierce warriors brandishing swords block their path. The white pawns await their move.",
    "1176": "In a swift motion, they sheath their swords and align themselves with the black chess pieces. Ron, with a burst of courage, mounts the stone horse of the black knight, surveying the expansive chessboard before him. Suddenly, a white pawn advances, prompting an anxious glance from Hermione towards Ron. Following Ron's instructions, a black pawn moves forward, only to have its head cleanly sliced off by the white pawn. The game commences in earnest, with explosions and destruction marking each move—white bishops and knights explode, a black pawn is annihilated, and the white queen devastates a black castle, reducing it to a pile of rubble.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Ron ponders his next move while Harry, observing the relentless white queen, finally grasps the strategy of Ron's game. Taking a deep breath, Ron grips the horse's reins tightly, his eyes shutting as the black horse begins to navigate through the shattered remnants of the stone chess pieces. Ron's gaze fixes nervously on the white king, adorned in a silver helmet and clutching a formidable sword with metal-encased hands.\n\nThe white queen pivots slowly, advancing with steady determination towards Ron's black horse. Ron clings to the reins, shaking with fear as the queen closes in, her movements fluid across the smooth marble floor. With a sudden strike, she stabs the black horse, sending Ron crashing to the ground, the horse collapsing beside him. Hermione, in a hurry, steps back onto her square, her eyes filled with anxiety as she looks towards the unconscious Ron.\n\nHarry swiftly moves into the winning position, his eyes meeting the white king's with confidence. The king's colossal sword clatters to the marble floor at Harry's feet. Harry and Hermione rush to Ron's side, kneeling beside him. Harry soon rises, leaving Hermione kneeling beside Ron, her gaze following Harry as he walks away.\n\nCautiously, Harry descends a flight of dimly lit white stone steps outside the chest room. As he moves down the stairs, he touches the scar on his forehead and sees a figure wearing a turban—Professor Quirrell—gazing into the Mirror of Erised. Harry's scar tingles as Quirrell stares intently into the mirror, his hand stretching out. Harry feels an inexplicable pull towards Quirrell, his eyes drawn to the Mirror of Erised.\n\nHarry stares at his reflection, which silently stares back before putting its hand in its pocket and retrieving a red stone. The reflection winks at Harry, shows him the stone, and then puts it back. Secretly, Harry feels in his own pocket, finding something there. Quirrell's impatience grows visible, prompting Harry to back away, standing with his back to the mirror. Slowly, Quirrell unwinds the turban from his head, revealing a hidden truth.",
    "1177": "In the gripping climax of the movie, a grotesque face sprouts from the back of Professor Quirrell's head, its eyes sunken in dark sockets and skin stretched taut over a bony skull. Horrified, Harry turns to flee, but a sudden sheet of flame blocks his path. Trapped, Harry sees his parents disappear from the mirror he holds, just as Quirrell lunges at him, sending him crashing to the ground. The Philosopher's Stone, a glowing red crystal, slips from Harry's grasp as Quirrell attempts to choke him. In a desperate struggle, Harry grabs Quirrell's hand, causing it to crumble into grey dust. Quirrell, disintegrating, lurches towards the stone, but Harry's touch accelerates his deterioration, reducing him to a pile of dust.\n\nVoldemort, who had been possessing Quirrell, vanishes momentarily. Bewildered, Harry looks around and finds the Philosopher's Stone flickering on the stairs. As he picks it up, a sense of relief washes over him. But his respite is short-lived. A swirling cloud of dust gathers behind him, and Voldemort's face reappears, screaming and knocking Harry off balance with a violent, rushing wind that seems to pass through him. The wind whirls Harry away like a tornado up the stone steps, leaving him unconscious, still clutching the glowing stone.\n\nHarry awakens in the hospital wing, pale and bandaged. He smiles weakly as he sees get-well cards and piles of sweets. Professor Dumbledore visits, sitting on Harry's bed and thoughtfully examining an empty box of sweets. Later, Harry, donning his black cloak, walks along a corridor and spots Ron and Hermione on an upper landing. Their faces light up upon seeing him, and Harry's smile broadens.\n\nIn the grand finale at the great hall, students in robes and pointed hats await Professor Dumbledore's address. Malfoy smirks as the Gryffindors join in the applause halfheartedly, signaling the close of another eventful year at Hogwarts.",
    "1178": "In a burst of chaos, visitors flee as a colossal snake winds its way across the Reptile House floor and out the door to freedom. Meanwhile, a soaked Dudley struggles to his feet, only to find the glass window of the snake house inexplicably restored, trapping him inside. Panicked, he pounds on the glass as his mother screams in terror. Uncle Vernon, noticing Harry's laughter, shoots him a suspicious glare.\n\nBack at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon's anger boils over. He grabs Harry by the hair and locks him away in the cupboard under the stairs. Suddenly, a tawny owl swoops low over the street, dropping a peculiar letter. Harry, retrieving the mail from the doormat, finds two letters and a postcard. One letter stands out, sealed with wax and addressed in emerald green ink, causing Harry's eyes to widen in surprise. As he wanders into the kitchen, still fixated on the envelope, Dudley snatches the letter away. Uncle Vernon examines the coat of arms on the back, his face a mask of horror as he looks at his wife. Harry watches, bewildered.\n\nMore letters arrive, delivered by owls perching on the TV aerial. Uncle Vernon intercepts and tears them up, but the letters keep coming. Harry, peeking from his cupboard, sees his uncle desperately blocking the letterbox. Aunt Petunia, seeing her husband off to work, notices the owls and the scattered letters, her expression grave. Inside, Harry is helpless as Vernon burns the envelopes, a sadistic smile playing on his lips.\n\nLater, as Vernon relaxes in his armchair, Harry hands around biscuits, his eyes drawn to the window. Outside, hundreds of owls perch on the rooftops and cars, an astonishing sight. Suddenly, a letter zips down the chimney, and a rush of wind fills the room. A cascade of envelopes pours down, covering every surface like a snowstorm. Terrified, Dudley leaps onto his mother's lap as Harry laughs delightedly. He grabs a letter and bolts for the cupboard, but Uncle Vernon catches him. Dudley and his mother flee to the hall, staring back in horror as more letters burst through the letterbox, overwhelming the room.",
    "1180": "In the dimly lit banking hall of Gringotts, gaunt goblins meticulously count stacks of coins with their spindly fingers at the counter. A clerk pauses, setting down his quill, as Hagrid rummages in his pocket and presents an envelope marked \"Top Secret.\" Their journey to this point has been via a hidden underground railway, guided by a goblin who now steps off the train. Hagrid hands the mysterious envelope to the goblin guide, and together with Harry, they traverse a damp, gloomy passage deep within the bank.\n\nA goblin attendant halts beside a formidable steel door. Hagrid takes a lamp from him, exchanging it for a heavy key. He turns the key in the lock, and the door creaks open, revealing a vault brimming with piles of glittering gold coins that leave Harry awestruck. Meanwhile, the goblin guide meticulously drags a long, sharp fingernail down the lock of vault 713. The door swings open, unveiling a small, shabbily wrapped parcel tied with string. Hagrid swiftly retrieves the package and tucks it into his pocket, with Harry nodding in acknowledgment.\n\nBack above ground in the bustling Diagon Alley, Harry consults his list and enters the quiet, dusty interior of Ollivanders wand shop. The shelves are lined with shadowy boxes, and an elderly man descends a ladder, scanning the shelves before selecting a long, narrow box. He presents Harry with a wand, but the first attempt goes awry as drawers burst open and boxes scatter. The second wand fares no better, shattering a china vase. Finally, after a thoughtful pause, Mr. Ollivander presents Harry with a slender, polished wand. As Harry grips it, a bright light flashes and a breeze rustles his hair, while the wand perfectly aligns with his forehead, signaling a harmonious match.\n\nAt the Leaky Cauldron Pub, Harry touches his distinctive scar, lost in thought. Later, at King's Cross Station, passersby gawk at the towering figure of Hagrid, who checks his watch. Harry reads his ticket but finds Hagrid has vanished, leaving behind a beautiful snowy owl in a cage atop his luggage. Harry pushes his trolley, searching for Platform 9 ¾, puzzled to find only Platforms 9 and 10. Spotting a porter, he follows a woman leading her family. The tallest of her red-haired boys pushes his trolley straight towards a brick wall and inexplicably disappears, leaving Harry both bewildered and intrigued by the magical world unfolding before him.",
    "1182": "In the grandeur of Hogwarts School, a series of events unfold, marking the beginning of a magical journey for the first-year students. Ron snickers, extending his hand towards Harry, who hesitates to shake it. Professor McGonagall returns, casting a stern, cautionary glance at Malfoy. The grand oak doors swing open, revealing the resplendent great hall, where the professor leads the way. The first-years march down the center, observed by curious older students seated at long tables.\n\nHermione's eyes widen as she gazes up at the ceiling, where hundreds of lighted candles float mid-air under a moonlit sky. Professor McGonagall pauses beside an old, patched wizard's hat resting on a stool before the high table. Hermione attempts to compose herself before taking a seat, and the professor places the Sorting Hat on her head. The hat speaks, and a delighted Hermione rushes to join the Gryffindor table.\n\nMeanwhile, Malfoy takes his seat, and as the hat touches his head, a mysterious man with black hair is noticed sitting beside Professor Quirrell. Harry winces, touching his scar. Ron steps forward apprehensively, and the Sorting Hat is placed upon his head, recognizing him instantly. Ron sighs in relief, eliciting a smile from Harry. Professor Dumbledore leans in with keen interest, while Hagrid holds his breath in anticipation.\n\nHarry ascends the platform, taking a seat on the stool as the Sorting Hat is placed on his head. The hat ponders thoughtfully, and as it makes its decision, Hagrid and the professors erupt in applause. The Gryffindors eagerly welcome Harry as he joins Ron and Hermione. Harry glances up towards the high table, where Professor Dumbledore winks and raises his golden goblet in salute.\n\nA sumptuous banquet magically materializes on the long tables, and the ecstatic children eagerly fill their plates. Ron, with a chicken drumstick in each hand, takes alternating bites. Seamus introduces himself, and Harry turns to acknowledge Ron's brother. Suddenly, a ghostly head appears in the middle of the table, as more spectral figures float around the great hall—a lady with ringlets, a plump monk, and a cavalier with a sword and a long, curling wig, all swooping above the tables. Percy engages in conversation with the ghost on the Gryffindor table, who eventually floats away. Ron calls after him, and the ghost tilts his half-severed head before gracefully replacing it.\n\nLater, Percy guides them upstairs, where staircases shift positions high above and the portraits come alive. A pretty flower girl curtsies, and an old man looks up from his book. Along the corridor, Percy halts before a guilt-framed portrait of a large lady with ringlets, clad in a pink-silk dress. She regards them inquisitively, beckoning graciously as the portrait swings aside to reveal a cozy sitting room with a blazing fire. In the boys' dormitory, uniforms are neatly folded on chairs beside their four-poster beds, signaling the start of their adventures at Hogwarts.",
    "1183": "Under the silver glow of the moon, Harry Potter sits wide-awake on the stone windowsill of his dormitory, his knees drawn close to his chest. Clad in pajamas, he gently strokes the soft feathers of his pet snowy owl, Hedwig, which turns its head in response to his touch. Gazing through the diamond-shaped windowpanes at the moonlit courtyard of Hogwarts, a contented smile spreads across Harry's face.\n\nThe next morning, Harry and Ron Weasley rush into their classroom, tardy for their lesson. A tabby cat perched on the teacher's desk looks up as they enter, and Hermione Granger casts a disapproving glance their way. In an instant, the cat transforms into Professor McGonagall, their stern Transfiguration teacher.\n\nLater, the towering figure of Professor Severus Snape sweeps into his Potions classroom, his dark robes billowing behind him. His eyes immediately fixate on Draco Malfoy, who returns a sly smile. Harry diligently takes notes, but Snape's gaze soon falls on him. Hermione nudges Harry, prompting him to reluctantly return his quill to the inkwell. Eager to participate, Hermione raises her hand, her expression betraying her desperation to provide the correct answer.\n\nIn the grand Great Hall, Seamus Finnigan curiously peers into a goblet, his face smudged with soot. Above, owls carrying mail flutter through high windows, swooping amongst the carved oak beams to deliver letters and parcels. Ron receives a newspaper and some letters, which he sets aside. Harry picks up the discarded newspaper, while Neville Longbottom unwraps a small glass ball that promptly turns red. Hermione watches them both with narrowed, suspicious eyes.\n\nOut in the school grounds, Madam Hooch, a neat woman with spiky silver hair, strides across the lawn, ready to instruct the students in flying. Harry's broom leaps into his hand, and Malfoy catches his own. Ron's broom flies up and smacks him in the nose, while Neville's broomstick lifts him high into the air, leaving him terrified and clinging for dear life. The broom swings him in circles and crashes into a stone tower, before spinning away and diving towards the ground. Madam Hooch takes out her whistle, scattering the children as Neville's broom zooms up over the statues on the battlements. His cloak catches on a sword, and he plummets to the ground, crashing heavily. Madam Hooch rushes to his side, her cloak flying behind her.\n\nMeanwhile, Malfoy finds the Remembrall and mounts his broom, flying high above his classmates. Harry swiftly steps astride his own broomstick and zooms after Malfoy, determined to catch him.",
    "1189": "In the heart of the Forbidden Forest, Buckbeak the hippogriff lifts his head, opens his beak, and snatches a bat mid-flight. A swarm of bats escapes into the open air, swooping low over Harry and Hermione, who stand nearby. Their attention is drawn back to Buckbeak, but their focus quickly shifts as, in the distance, they witness a chilling scene: a dog and a werewolf locked in a brutal fight near the Whomping Willow.\n\nWith a sense of urgency, Harry and Hermione dash through the dense undergrowth. Ahead, they see the werewolf hurl the dog against a rock. Harry envisions himself throwing a stone to distract the creature, but the werewolf turns and begins to advance menacingly towards them. Hermione releases a desperate howl, and the pair race back through the moonlit forest, their path impeded by the rough terrain. Hot on their heels, the savage werewolf pursues them effortlessly. Harry stumbles over a tree root, but Hermione swiftly helps him to his feet.\n\nPausing to catch their breath, they take refuge behind the twisted trunk of an ancient tree. The werewolf sniffs the ground, then vanishes around the other side of their hiding spot. They cautiously survey their surroundings, then begin to creep away stealthily. Suddenly, the vicious creature reappears, rearing up and preparing to strike. Just as the werewolf is about to attack, Buckbeak swoops in, his massive wings flapping thunderously. With his powerful talons, he claws at the werewolf, sending it slinking away. Hermione hides her face on Harry's shoulder, seeking solace from the terrifying ordeal.\n\nA sudden gust of air scatters the dry leaves at their feet, and they look up to see a grim sight: a swarm of Dementors gliding malevolently across the sky. Taking charge, Harry grasps Hermione's hand and leads them towards the lake. On the far shore, he sees a vision of himself and Sirius lying unconscious, vulnerable to the approaching Dementors. The hooded creatures swoop down repeatedly, attempting to overpower the defenseless figures.\n\nHarry bursts from the trees and stands at the lake's edge, pointing his wand and channeling all his strength. His wand pulsates with energy, emitting a silver mist that pushes the Dementors back. The light from his wand intensifies, creating a luminous shield that stretches across the lake. Though the Dementors swirl angrily overhead, Harry's concentration never wavers, and they eventually retreat. As his vision fades, so too does the light from his wand, and Harry sees himself collapsing beside Sirius.\n\nWith Harry and Hermione safely on his back, Buckbeak takes flight, soaring towards Hogwarts Castle. The hippogriff glides down to the dark tower where Sirius is imprisoned, and Hermione manages to open the barred door of his cell. Once freed, Sirius climbs onto Buckbeak's back, a grateful smile spread across his face. Together, the group ascends into the night, leaving the dark tower behind as Buckbeak carries them away to safety.",
    "1190": "In the quiet of a rainy night, street lights dance in the puddles scattered across damp pavements. A lone figure, Harry, finally slows his pace and takes in his surroundings. Before him lies a small, worn patch of grass in an otherwise deserted children's playground. He is utterly alone. Exhausted, he sinks down onto the pavement's edge, huddling against the biting cold and damp. Above, a streetlight flickers before succumbing to darkness.\n\nUnexpectedly, the playground stirs to life; empty swings sway, the roundabout rotates, and a seesaw thumps onto the grass. From the shadows of the bushes, a massive black dog emerges, looming over Harry. Startled, Harry rises, drawing his wand as he stumbles back. A bright light approaches, revealing a peculiar purple triple-decker bus rumbling towards him. The conductor, squinting at a grimy card, reads aloud before tucking it away and turning his gaze to Harry. Despite his nervous glance back at the bushes, Harry boards the bus, aided by Stan, who hefts his trunk inside.\n\nThe lower deck is lined with beds, one already occupied. Above, Harry glimpses ornate galleries and a chandelier suspended from the roof. Stan cranks a ticket from his machine and hands it to Harry before signaling to the driver, Ernie. A Rastafarian shrunken head dangling near the driver cackles as the bus lurches into motion. Harry tumbles backwards onto a bed as Ernie, peering through thick glasses, navigates the streets erratically.\n\nThe bus grinds to an abrupt halt, sending Harry's face against the window. An elderly lady with a walking frame slowly crosses before them. Catching sight of a newspaper headline in Stan's hands, Harry is distracted as two London buses bear down upon them. Unfazed, Ernie yanks a lever, and their bus compresses, squeezing between the oncoming vehicles before veering down a narrow alley. Harry is thrown against the window again as they clip a parked car.\n\nFinally, the peculiar purple bus judders to a stop, and Harry disembarks, greeted by Tom, the hunchbacked innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron. The bus vanishes into the night as Harry steps inside the dimly lit pub. Within, a man reads silently while his spoon stirs his drink unaided, and chairs flip themselves onto the tables. Upstairs, Harry finds his snowy owl and the Minister for Magic, Mr. Fudge, awaiting him. With Tom's assistance, Harry summons his owl, his gaze drawn to the bustling marketplace below. A train rattles past on elevated tracks.\n\nTurning to a pile of books by the fire, Harry notices one volume growling. Its hairy cover sports glassy eyes and sharp fangs. Suddenly, the book flies into a rage, snapping wildly. It leaps from Harry's grasp, gnashing at his feet.",
    "1192": "In the grand hall, each singer in the front row clutches a massive toad, an unusual sight to behold. Professor Lupin rises from his seat, acknowledging the students with a nod. Suddenly, the gigantic Hagrid stands up, his bulk knocking against the table. He snuffs out a candle, only for it to relight itself mysteriously. The assembly begins to disperse, leaving the hall behind.\n\nHarry and his friends ascend the moving staircase, heading towards a portrait of a fat lady, who is joyfully singing while holding a glass. With a sudden flourish, she smashes the glass against a pillar, and the portrait swings back, granting them entry into the common room. A ghost casually drifts through them, unnoticed. Inside, the boys eagerly experiment with magical sweets. Neville and Ron try them, and suddenly, steam shoots from Harry's ears in a comical display.\n\nOutside, a storm brews as rain lashes against the windows and lightning flashes dramatically. The storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, and ominously, black-cloaked Dementors hover just outside the school grounds. Meanwhile, a small bird flies along the stone cloister, swooping down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which playfully thwacks the bird, sending feathers flying.\n\nIn a classroom, a mystery unfolds as a figure recoils in surprise. Later, outside the school, students trail Hagrid around the sunlit forest's edge to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall. Malfoy, with his usual arrogance, strokes his monster book, which purrs contentedly. He approaches Harry, feigning terror as he points over Harry's shoulder. Harry spins around, and Malfoy's cronies dramatically pull up their hooded cloaks, adding to the theatrics. Neville, looking bedraggled, stands amidst the commotion.\n\nA magnificent creature appears before them, causing all but Harry to step back. With a gentle push from Ron, Harry nervously moves forward and bows. The creature responds by flapping its huge wings and bowing its birdlike head. Hagrid tosses it a tidbit, and Malfoy eagerly pushes to the front. Harry stretches out his hand, and Hermione, clutching Ron's hand, watches with embarrassment. Harry pats the creature, and with a smack from Hagrid, it raises its wings and takes off.\n\nHarry clings desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck as the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, soars above the trees. The distant landscape reveals a river winding through the valley, the hippogriff's strong wings carrying them higher. They navigate between Hogwarts School's towers and turrets, rising above the craggy hillside. The silvery sun filters through the storm clouds, turning the waters of a vast lake below into steely gray. Harry sees his reflection as Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface. Relaxing, Harry enjoys the sensation, a huge smile crossing his face as he spreads his arms wide. He grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake. Finally, Hagrid calls them back, and the hippogriff soars down through the treetops, using its wings as a brake before landing gently in a clearing.",
    "1195": "In the depths of a wintry afternoon, Ron and Hermione traverse the snow, tracking footprints until they arrive at the forest's edge. Ron hesitates as Hermione advances alone through a clearing, drawn towards the sound of weeping. The falling snow muffles her steps. Approaching her distressed friend, she kneels and gently removes the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry, who looks up at her in misery. Nearby, a yellow butterfly dances above the emerging snowdrops, while the Whomping Willow contorts its trunk, dislodging snow from its branches.\n\nThe scene shifts to Lupin's room, where Harry is present, his expression grave. He tightens his grip on his wand. Lupin unlocks a trunk, releasing a Dementor into the room. Overwhelmed, Harry crumples into unconsciousness. Revived by the taste of chocolate, Harry nods, signaling his readiness. Lupin opens the trunk once more, and this time, Harry is prepared. A powerful silver Patronus emanates from his wand, acting as a shield against the Dementor's malevolent presence. With steadfast resolve, Harry compels the creature to retreat into the trunk. Delighted, Lupin seals the lid shut with a triumphant laugh.\n\nLater, in the Hogwarts quadrangle, Hagrid is seen by the lake, skipping stones across the water's surface. His expression turns anguished as he hurls one more stone into the depths.\n\nUnder the cover of night, the school corridors lie shrouded in darkness and emptiness. In the boys' dormitory, Harry sits upright in bed, snacking on a biscuit and scrutinizing the Marauder’s Map by the glow of his wand. Ron stirs briefly from a nightmare before drifting back to sleep. Harry's attention is captured by the movement of Filch's footprints on the map, but his focus sharply shifts when he notices another name—Peter Pettigrew.\n\nStartled, Harry ventures into the corridor. An old man in a portrait recoils from the brightness of Harry's wand. Diligently following the map, Harry sees his own name and footprints materialize on the parchment as he advances. He scans the dark, vacant corners with his wand, frequently checking the map. Peter Pettigrew's footprints dart chaotically across the map, seemingly heading straight for Harry. Panicking, Harry spins around, wand raised, only to encounter his reflection in a mirror. Portraits along the corridor protest the intrusive light. Harry hastily taps the map, extinguishing his wand.\n\nSnape appears, his wand illuminated and pointed at Harry. Harry opens the map, which Snape then touches with his wand, revealing mysterious writing. Snape snatches the map just as Harry follows Lupin, leaving the portraits to glare at Snape in their wake.\n\nIn a classroom, Lupin examines the Marauder's Map, his expression one of disbelief. Meanwhile, in a cluttered Divination classroom filled with overstuffed furniture and shelves of teacups, Hermione knocks a crystal ball to the floor. She picks up her bag and storms out, the crystal ball rolling after her down the corridor.\n\nLater, Harry ascends a circular staircase, carrying the crystal ball. He retraces his steps back to Professor Trelawney's classroom, his gaze sweeping over the chaotic assortment of furniture and teacups.",

A chaotic chase ensues around the living room as John trips over a chair, but he eventually catches Marley and pries open his jaws to retrieve the necklace. Later, John is seen meticulously spraying Marley's mess with a hose, searching for the lost jewelry.\n\nThe scene shifts to a doctor's office, where a solemn moment unfolds. The doctor holds a probe to Jenny's stomach, moving a scanner around on the gel-covered area. A fuzzy image appears on the screen, and the doctor's frown deepens as she removes the scanner. Leaving the Grogans anxiously waiting, the doctor returns with a reassuring smile, placing the scanner back on Jenny's stomach. Jenny nods tightly, and the doctor withdraws with a sympathetic apology. The couple drives home in silence, lost in thought, the tension palpable as they navigate the palm tree-lined roads and sunny freeways.\n\nBack home, John opens the door for Jenny, but Marley's enthusiastic greeting is brushed aside. Jenny slumps onto the sofa, her eyes distant as she pets Marley, who rests his chin on her knee. As tears well up, she leans forward to hug the loyal dog. John, filled with concern, sits beside her, stroking her back soothingly.\n\nTime passes, and a young dark-haired woman named Debbie arrives, carrying a bag and suitcase. Marley playfully chases Debbie, eventually winning their towel-tugging game. Debbie offers sedatives to calm the rowdy dog, but Marley's antics continue as he chews on the sofa. The Grogans find themselves in a quaintly decorated twin room, John wincing at the creaky bed springs as Jenny sits down. They share a tender kiss, snuggled under a floral quilt beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary.\n\nBack at their chewed-up home, a yellow taxi pulls up. Marley stands at the door, wagging his tail, and later watches intently at a rain-lashed window. The dog seeks John's company, running under his desk and climbing onto his lap as he works.

As the Grogans sleep, Marley busies himself chewing John's socks and head-butting his food bin, knocking books off a shelf in the process.\n\nThrough laughter and tears, the Grogans navigate life with their mischievous yet lovable Marley, finding solace and joy in their shared journey.",
    "1202": "In the opening scene, John trudges down the palm tree-lined front path of a house with a pool, his reflection glinting off the large new car in the driveway. He stoops, unsmiling, to collect the newspapers scattered across the drive. Inside, he cradles a baby, scolding Marley, the dog, who is eagerly investigating Patrick's breakfast. John’s frown at the scene is captured in a photo.\n\nLater that night, John pulls up to the house in his old blue Honda, parking behind the new people carrier. Through the window, he sees Jenny holding the baby, with Marley bounding playfully around them. John sits back, lost in thought, until Jenny notices him and beckons him inside. Reluctantly, he exits the car and enters the house, his expression blank.\n\nInside, Jenny and Patrick sit silently at the table, their faces mirroring each other's gloom. John attends to the baby while Marley lurks near Patrick, eyeing his food. Jenny tries to pry a book from Patrick's grasp, but Marley leaps in, savaging the book, much to John's dismay.\n\nAs the night deepens, Jenny tucks the baby into his cot and kisses Patrick goodnight, shutting the blinds and softly closing the door behind her. She pads barefoot to her room, where Marley is sprawled on the bed. Placing a pillow beside the dog, she lies down, and Marley rests his head in her lap, gently wagging his tail. Suddenly, frustration overwhelms Jenny. She storms to the boys' room, Marley bumbling excitedly behind her, knocking over a lamp and pulling down a blind. She secures the baby in his high chair just as Marley bowls over Patrick.\n\nJohn arrives home to find Marley chewing a toy on the sofa. He hands a bag of dog food to Sebastian, who nods awkwardly, surrounded by a pile of boxes. John gazes out at the city before returning home to find Jenny dozing on the sofa. He sits opposite her, and she regards him with a shake of her head. He responds with a puzzled smile.\n\nIn a flashback, Jenny is seen holding a newborn, smiling as a nurse wheels her along. Later, Colleen sleeps in a swinging seat while the family and Marley splash in the pool, playing ball.

Spotting John, other owners follow his lead, including a tanned woman in a bikini who releases her boxer. Soon, a massive Rottweiler joins the fun, charging into the surf. John's grin widens as more dogs splash and play together in the shallows, with one owner tossing a Frisbee for his border collie. However, John's amusement is short-lived as Marley begins to circle in the shallows, preparing to defecate. The bikini-clad woman looks concerned, while other owners watch in horror. The Rottweiler's owner closes his eyes in disbelief as John lunges towards Marley. Summoning his dog, the Rottweiler owner retreats just as a police 4x4 rolls onto the beach. Officers, dressed in shorts and ball caps, emerge from the vehicle.\n\nLater that night, John arrives home in his Volvo with Marley. They enter the darkened house, where John is greeted by his two boys. Grinning with embarrassed delight, he scoops up Connor. Jenny approaches, holding Colleen, and kisses John, revealing a large square cake covered in candles. Chaos ensues as Marley leaps onto the table, helping himself to the cake. Despite the commotion, the backyard pool is adorned with floating flower candles, setting a romantic atmosphere. John indulges Marley with more cake before Jenny playfully strips down and jumps into the pool. John follows suit, shedding his shirt and performing a cannonball into the water. As they cuddle naked, Marley swims past them.\n\nIn the following scene, John packs items from his desk into a box at the Philadelphia Inquirer's sprawling offices. Hefting the box, he approaches Arnie, who stands outside his office. John pats Arnie on the shoulder, and the older man leans in for a half hug. John departs with a grin. The Grogan family embarks on a new journey, their people carrier traversing green fields and lush woodland. Marley eagerly leans out the window, taking in the country road's sights and scents. Upon arrival at their large stone-built house, Marley bounds up the steps and playfully headbutts a stone bird table, knocking it off the porch.\n\nAs winter sets in, the Grogan family enjoys a snow-covered garden. Wrapped up for the cold, they engage in a spirited snowball fight. Jenny and John pull the children on a sledge, with Marley trotting alongside. Little Colleen tumbles off, and Marley playfully attacks their snowman. Amidst the chaos, John and Jenny share a warm smile and hug. That evening, John ascends the stairs, switching off the lights. He checks on sleeping Colleen before peeking in on the boys in their bunks, content with the day's events.",
    "1207": "In the crimson glow, mercenaries synchronize their watches, preparing for their mission. Lewis pulls a hood over his head as the team, including Rambo, ready themselves. School Boy, his head concealed by a black hat, ascends the wooden steps of the camp's watchtower with stealth. Drawing a menacing serrated blade from its sheath, he prepares for the task ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, a guard in a rain poncho, smoking a cigarette, spots the headlights of an approaching truck. He steps onto the rain-soaked road as the vehicle nears the camp. Behind the wheel, BN is disguised as a soldier. School Boy silently mounts the watchtower platform, where an unsuspecting lookout sits. Swiftly, School Boy muffles the guard's mouth and strikes with his blade. He then positions his rifle on the watchtower's timbers.\n\nInside the truck, Rambo's gaze and bandana are reflected in BN's rearview mirror. BN's brow furrows in concentration as they approach the camp's guard post. The guard, cigarette in hand, waves them through without incident. School Boy checks his watch—it's nine minutes to two.\n\nAs the truck continues moving, Rambo signals to Reese, who jumps off, rolls, and hides. En-Joo follows, taking cover around a hut with his weapon raised. Rambo gives Lewis a firm pat on the shoulder, and the hooded man disembarks, finding cover between two huts. Diaz leaps from the truck, landing awkwardly, while Rambo jumps off as they cross a small wooden bridge, taking position by a hut.\n\nInside the camp, troops are enthralled by an exotic dance performance. Rambo peers through the hut's wooden slats, witnessing a figure tattooing another's back. He quickly moves on. At the dance show, some soldiers sway drunkenly to the music, their eyes glazed with inebriation. The dancing women, mere peasants, wear expressions of dull indifference.\n\nBN brings the truck to a stop and exits the cab, pausing near the vehicle's hood. En-Joo and Reese reconnoiter the huts, glimpsing disturbing scenes within—a man crudely tattooing a woman, and another man seated before a nude female, hands gripping her waist. Rambo checks his watch—seven minutes to two.\n\nNearby, a man hangs crucified on a timber frame, pigs feasting on the flesh of his leg. Above him, captive volunteers are blindfolded in a cage. One prisoner senses Rambo's approach. Drawing his homemade machete, Rambo advances towards the cage, ready to free the prisoners.",
    "1209": "In the grimy, chaotic scene, a soldier drags a struggling dancing girl towards his hut. He viciously slaps her, sending her crashing to the ground before gesturing towards the hut and crawling underneath it. Unbeknownst to him, En-Joo silently emerges, clamping a hand over her mouth and signaling for silence. The soldier, puzzled, peers under the hut, only to be ambushed by En-Joo, who plunges a knife into his throat, repeatedly stabbing until the life drains from the soldier's body. He swiftly drags the corpse out of sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Rambo sprints towards another hut, diving underneath it. He spots Sarah, lying motionless in the filth of a pig sty. Frantically, he throws open the wooden bolt, swings the gate wide, and crawls inside, scanning the area through the narrow gaps between timbers. A drunken soldier, clutching a bottle of spirits, is seen approaching. Sarah remains ominously still, either asleep or unconscious. Rambo rushes to her side, pushing past the pigs that obstruct his path.\n\nSimultaneously, En-Joo checks his watch—just ten seconds shy of 2 AM. Above, School Boy has a soldier locked in his weapon's sights from the watchtower. As his watch ticks to 2 AM, he fires, systematically eliminating the guard below and those in adjacent watchtowers. En-Joo and the rescued girl exchange urgent glances, spurring into action.\n\nBut their movements are too late; a drunken soldier has already reached Sarah, hauling her away by her hair, arms tightly bound. Rambo, hidden, watches as she's brutally dragged off. He waits a beat, then stealthily follows. Meanwhile, BN’s party joins En-Joo and the girls in a dark clearing just beyond the camp’s gate.\n\nAt the chaotic dance, pandemonium breaks loose. One woman is throttled by a soldier as another dashes through the crowd, waving a flare that billows red smoke. Amidst this chaos, a mercenary named Lewis forcefully throws Michael to the ground, drawing a knife on him. BN intervenes, leading the group away while School Boy shoots Lewis a murderous look.\n\nSmoke from the flare consumes the dance, casting the scene in an eerie red haze. A woman's dress is savagely torn, leaving her topless and vulnerable. Rambo, relentless in his pursuit, tracks Sarah and her captor. The soldier drags her into his hut, violently throwing her to the floor. Free from prying eyes, he slaps her face savagely, echoing the abuses suffered by others at the hands of his drunken comrades.\n\nTowering over Sarah, the soldier reaches for his belt buckle. Before he can act, Rambo strikes from behind, grasping a clump of the soldier's hair with one hand and clutching his throat with the other. The soldier's face contorts into a grimace of agony as Rambo's fingers burrow deep into cartilage and bone, squeezing the life from his enemy.",
    "1210": "In a burst of violence, Rambo tears out an enemy's throat and discards him on the floor. Sarah, startled, looks up. Meanwhile, soldiers quarrel over women at a lively dance. Seizing the moment, Rambo guides Sarah away from the officer's hut, traversing the compound together. Chaos erupts as the dance hut is swallowed by red smoke, and intoxicated soldiers, grinning, stumble out. One soldier playfully taps another on the shoulder, oblivious to the unfolding escape.\n\nRambo leads Sarah beneath a wooden bridge spanning a stream, where they hide briefly as drunken troops stagger overhead. From their concealed position, they watch the soldiers' sturdy boots pass by. Amidst the turmoil, a woman is forcibly dragged from the smoky dance hut. Unnoticed, Rambo and Sarah move upstream, leaving behind the remnants of the disrupted party. The last of the soldiers wobble away from the dance hut, marking the end of the festivities.\n\nEmerging from the stream, Sarah and Rambo climb onto the road, but Sarah slips in the mud. Patrolling guards spot them, swiftly raising their rifles. In a protective instinct, Rambo leaps onto Sarah to shield her. School Boy, hidden nearby, shoots one guard. Taking aim again, School Boy's second shot explodes the other guard's head, sending him crashing through a fence. With the immediate threat neutralized, Rambo and Sarah flee, leaving School Boy to close a night-vision sight on his weapon.\n\nThe rain ceases, and the moon emerges from behind clouds. The camp commander, clad in a vest, pushes a small boy out of his hut, watching as the boy walks away before retreating inside and closing the door. Under the cover of the newly revealed moonlight, Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy dash through the forest, pausing only briefly at a tree trunk to catch their breath. Rambo turns to School Boy, and they exchange a silent, meaningful stare before pressing on.\n\nAs dawn breaks, the camp buzzes with activity. Tracker dogs, loaded into trucks, sniff around for scents. The commander, furious, storms out of his hut, exchanging words with a junior officer before discovering the grisly sight of a soldier's corpse in another hut, blood pooling on the floor. Shaken, he takes a few short breaths and departs.\n\nRambo, Sarah, and School Boy press on, running past a towering rock wall. The commander, now standing in the passenger seat of a truck equipped with a mounted machine-gun, leads a convoy out of the camp. Two open-topped lorries, filled with troops, follow closely behind. Meanwhile, Lewis guides his group of mercenaries and rescued peasants through the forest, with Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy trailing some distance behind. Back on a dirt road, one of the lorries halts, and a contingent of troops dismounts, weapons at the ready, primed for the hunt.",
    "1212": "In the dense jungle, a man's attention is drawn to a cloth bundled with twine. As he lifts it, a concealed bomb mechanism is exposed, triggering a violent chain reaction. A claymore mine detonates a nearby Tall Boy Missile, sending a towering mushroom cloud of smoke and flame into the sky. The explosion tears through the foliage, felling trees and scattering debris, as soldiers are thrown to the ground by the concussive force. Sarah and School Boy witness the devastating spectacle from a distance. Meanwhile, a tall boat captain, stationed on the river, spots the grey smoke billowing from the blast and relays a silent signal before the boat hastily departs.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Sarah and School Boy press on, darting down a leaf-covered path. School Boy abruptly halts, pulling Sarah down to a crouch. Using his rifle scope as a makeshift telescope, he surveys the area from their hidden vantage point. Through the lens, they witness a brutal scene unfolding: escapees are viciously kicked and beaten by soldiers, while the commander of the operation oversees the violence, meting out his own cruel punishments with a stick. The prisoners, a mix of mercenaries and missionaries, vainly attempt to shield themselves from the blows raining down upon them.\n\nFrom their elevated position on a hill overlooking the harbor, Sarah and School Boy watch in horror as the troops arrange their captives into a line, forcing them to their knees in a grim execution-style tableau. Michael, one of the prisoners, gazes ahead in despair, while En-Joo defiantly spits on the ground. Unseen by the gunner of a Jeep-mounted machine gun, Rambo emerges from the shadows, swiftly decapitating the gunner with a machete before turning the weapon on the driver and the nearby Burmese soldiers.\n\nSchool Boy, taking aim from his perch, expertly lines up a group of soldiers in his sights and fells two with a single shot. Panicked by the sudden resistance, the remaining troops scramble, but Rambo's relentless machine gun fire cuts them down in a bloody sweep. En-Joo, seizing the opportunity, grabs a fallen soldier's weapon and joins the fray, while Lewis dispatches an opponent with brutal efficiency, snatching a weapon for himself. Reese, too, fights back, drawing a concealed knife from his boot to stab an adjacent trooper. As the battle rages on, Sarah covers her ears, trying to block out the cacophony of gunshots and the harsh reality of war.",
    "1213": "In the heat of battle, **En-Joo**, having exhausted his ammunition, scavenges a grenade from a fallen comrade, activates it, and launches it at the enemy. Meanwhile, **Reese** engages in brutal combat, striking one soldier with his rifle butt before shooting another, while **Lewis** provides covering fire from behind a tree. **Diaz** lethally twists a soldier's neck and stabs him, adding to the chaotic melee.\n\nNeeding a new weapon, En-Joo scales a wooden staircase and finds a rifle, immediately using it to take down more enemies. **Rambo**,, also out of ammo, takes cover behind a mounted gun. **Sarah** watches the intense scene, her face etched with worry. A soldier lobs a live grenade at En-Joo, and although **Lewis** neutralizes the thrower, the grenade finds its mark, leaving En-Joo's lifeless body crumpled on the ground.\n\nRambo, hidden behind the gun, discovers a box of ammo and hurriedly reloadsy, even as a volunteer escapes, pursued by a pistol-wielding commander. **Michael** spots the commander who coldly guns down the fleeing volunteer. Rambo, now surrounded, barely avoids the barrage of bullets flying past as he finishes reloading.\n\nMichael witnesses a soldier stealthily advancing on Lewis, who takes a bullet to the shoulder. Enraged, Michael pounces on the attacker, the pair tumbling down a short slope. Seizing a rock, Michael ferociously bludgeons the soldier, leaving him unconscious and bloody. Exhausted and horrified, Michael collapses onto the sand.\n\nThe battlefield erupts in flames as a soldier, engulfed in fire, is thrown through the air. Amidst the chaos, a man in orange readies a mortar launcher, while a mix of khaki-clad and civilian-dressed figures rush down the hill. Rambo, finally reloaded, opens fire on the remaining troops. Another rebel, on the hill, loads a second mortar and braces for the blast.\n\n**BN**, after leaping over a tree trunk and firing on troops, spots the commander retreating, waving his soldiers to follow. The commander's forces, however, are cut down one by one, leaving him to flee alone. BN then notices a patrol boat rounding a river bend, and rushes down to the water's edge. The boat's gunner opens fire, demolishing the foliage camouflaging Rambo's boat. Equipped with a flamethrower and machine gun, the patrol boat incinerates rebels with a devastating stream of flame.\n\nRambo fights back, his bullets ripping through the boat's cabin. But he's hit and falls from his machine-gun perch. Sarah covers her ears, shielding herself from the deafening battle. A volunteer in a brown shirt is engulfed in flames and desperately rolls in the sand to extinguish them. The fate of the rebels hangs in the balance as the brutal battle rages on.",
    "1206": "A montage of news images kicks off the scene. Two large military trucks rumble along a dusty road, one carrying a lone soldier, the other a full troop. The trucks screech to a halt, and soldiers in khaki fatigues and wide-brimmed hats bearing a golden Burmese military emblem spill out, brandishing rifles. They bark orders at a group of terrified peasants, herding them off the truck. The soldiers pass around cash, while an officer in dark glasses sits calmly in one of the trucks, smoking a cigarette.\n\nOne soldier wanders into a nearby paddy field, tossing a primed grenade. The villagers cower in fear as the soldier throws two more grenades, which land harmlessly on the wet ground. He stops about 100 yards from the truck. The peasants are prodded at gunpoint to the field's edge, where they begin to stumble and half-run towards the solitary soldier. The troops watch with impassive faces as the commander takes a drag on his cigarette. Suddenly, one of the peasants is blown to pieces, bringing the group to a halt. The commander nods to a soldier, who then orders the troops to open fire, gunning down the peasants.\n\nThe scene shifts to a peaceful valley nestled among the mountains, with low clouds hovering above and ferns edging the lush landscape. A small stream trickles through, as captions in military white type appear. Three men, including John Rambo, poke at the undergrowth with sticks. Rambo, dark-haired and muscular, wears a khaki smock and a red paisley bandanna. A cobra rears up from the grass, and the men, revealed to be snake-wranglers, surround it. Rambo deftly scoops up the snake and secures it in a sack.\n\nThe trio returns to a small boat moored on a sandbank, where the stream widens into a river. They wade through shallow water, with Rambo leading the way up the gangplank. The boat, now on a lake, is silhouetted against the sun. Rambo stands on the prow, bow and arrow in hand, with a line attached to the arrow. He draws the bowstring and fires into the water, pulling out a large, skewered fish. As the boat journeys down the river, they pass a small canoe carrying two men and a boy. One of Rambo's friends hands a fish to the child.",
    "1222": "In a grim tableau, the parched, muddy ground is strewn with the corpses of people and animals. Among the lifeless forms, a man lies with his head partly blown off, and nearby, the skeletal remains of a child are visible. En-Joo stands amidst this carnage, a moody expression on his face. He tosses aside a cigarette, his movement catching BN's attention, who abruptly signals everyone to take cover behind the charred remnants of a timber framework. Their eyes trace a military lorry rumbling along the edge of a paddy field, its covered tail concealing unknown contents. The vehicle grinds to a halt, and soldiers force a group of five male peasants off the tailboard at gunpoint. School Boy looks nervously at Diaz, who frowns, glancing at a hanging severed head as a soldier points his rifle skyward.\n\nThe peasants, interpreting the gunfire as a signal, begin a desperate race across the paddy field, stumbling through the water. BN and the mercenaries watch in horror and grim resignation. Time seems to slow as the peasants slosh through the mire, miraculously reaching the other side, where they collapse on the bank. However, their ordeal is not over. A soldier screams angrily, kicking one peasant in the head, and another raises his rifle, bullets striking the ground near the huddled men. Angry gestures from the troops drive the frightened peasants to attempt the crossing again.\n\nSuddenly, an arrow pierces a soldier's back as Rambo dashes through the trees, firing arrows from his bow. School Boy watches in astonishment as more soldiers fall, one after the other, arrows protruding from their backs, heads, and legs. One soldier tumbles into the paddy field, detonating a grenade as he lands. Seizing the chaotic moment, the peasants rush towards BN and the mercenaries. Rambo joins them, addressing BN directly. Lewis, however, turns his back on Rambo, who, in a swift and threatening gesture, draws an arrow and aims it at Lewis's right eye. The mercenaries, startled, train their weapons on Rambo, exchanging worried glances. Tension hangs heavy in the air before Rambo finally lowers his bow, and Lewis exhales in relief.\n\nThe scene shifts to a rainy night at a military camp. Soldiers smoke and drink beer in the mess hut, enthralled by women performing an exotic dance on stage. Meanwhile, Sarah languishes in a pigsty, her hair disheveled, clothes dirty, and dark circles under her eyes. She peers through gaps in the floorboards, watching the commander pace calmly back and forth. Simultaneously, the mercenaries, having commandeered the soldiers' truck, are driven along a dirt track towards the camp, Lewis holding a torch to light the way.",
    "1225": "In a motel room, Ben gazes into the mirror as he meticulously scrapes off his thick stubble with a wet razor. He pauses, scrutinizing his reflection with a sober expression. Later, Ben arrives at Emily's house, exiting his car with a gift-wrapped parcel in hand, only to change his mind and leave it behind. As he approaches the house, Emily opens the door, and a nurse steps out.\n\nBen, dressed in his usual gray suit, shirt, and tie, enters Emily's bedroom bearing the gift. His eyes are drawn to a wall adorned with photos of Emily from various stages of her life. He examines them thoughtfully before moving to the window, where a delicate net curtain filters the light. From there, he observes Emily carrying a casserole from the oven to a table illuminated by candles. In the shadows, a tea light flickers on another table. Ben places the gift down and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror.\n\nEmerging from the bedroom, Ben is now casually dressed in a polo shirt and jeans. He stands at the open French windows, looking slightly self-conscious in his outfit. Emily, seated at the table, nods and smiles at him, inviting him to join her outside with a wave. Surrounded by the warm glow of candles, Ben looks around before taking his seat. Emily watches him intently, her expression transforming from serious to encouraging as Ben eagerly picks up his fork. He tries a mouthful, barely concealing a slight grimace, but musters a sincere look. Emily beams triumphantly.\n\nAs they continue to sit at the table, Emily's brow furrows while listening to Ben hum. She shakes her head and approaches a record player, her back turned to Ben. After a brief hesitation and a deep breath, she sets a record spinning. Singing along, she extends her hand to Ben, who is lost in thought with his hands clasped in front of him. She tenderly slips her slender hand between his, pulling him to his feet. Ben's face lights up with a smile.\n\nThey dance closely, Emily's left hand on Ben's right shoulder, his right hand on her back, their free hands clasped together. Their eyes lock in an intense gaze, faces inches apart, as they sway gently. Ben nods, and with Emily's hands on his shoulders, he leads her into the workshop, switching on the light. He walks over to a mysterious object referred to as the \"Beast,\" and Emily's eyes widen as she scans the workshop, eagerly trying to spot the surprise.",
    "1226": "In the gleaming workshop, a skeptical Emily approaches a proud Ben, her smile not quite concealing her doubt. With a slight reach, she goes for the switch. Her eyes widen in awe as the fly wheels whirr and spin, and she looks at Ben with newfound admiration. She presses down a lever, and the machine hums to life; piston arms pump rhythmically, feeding paper onto the platen where it's dutifully printed upon. Emily watches the mechanism in amazement, then impulsively wraps her arms around Ben's neck, pulling him into a tight hug.\n\nBen, initially hesitant, gradually responds to her touch. He rests his head on her shoulder, closes his eyes, and lays his hands softly on her back. Emily, tears brimming in her eyes, nuzzles into him. Ben pulls back slightly, then gently draws her into a lingering kiss. Emily's fingers brush against Ben's cheek as they continue to kiss passionately. When they finally break off, they stand with their foreheads touched together, sharing an intimate moment. Ben pulls back a little, then tenderly kisses her fingertips.\n\nAbruptly, Ben hurries out of the workshop. He steps over the low picket fence, unlocks his car, and retrieves a hidden gift. Meanwhile, his brother Tim approaches. Ben, now revealed as Tim, reaches into the car for an ID and hands it to his brother, the real Ben. Tim looks sheepish as the real Ben considers the ID uneasily. Tim reaches into his pocket, pulls out another item, and hands it over. Then, he jogs back towards the house, stepping over the picket fence, and returning to the workshop.\n\nInside, Emily sits in a sultry pose, awaiting his return. She stands as he enters, but Tim shuffles uneasily away from her touch. Ever-persistent, Emily draws his face to hers and kisses his cheek. Tim slowly calms, allowing her to kiss his cheek several more times. Cupping his face in her hands, Emily kisses Tim on the lips. Though he remains motionless at first, he gradually begins to kiss her back, tears rolling down his cheeks. The couple wraps their arms tightly around each other, their kiss filled with mounting passion.\n\nEmily's arms entwine around Tim's neck as he lifts her, carrying her out of the workshop. They fall back onto gold satin pillows, Tim kneeling over Emily as she helps him out of his polo shirt. She notices a long scar stretching from his side to his back. In the golden light, Emily slips off her delicate sandals and undoes the clasp on her halterneck dress. She and Tim move slowly into a tender kiss, his hand gently resting on a scar on her naked breast. Outside, rain streaks the window, creating a hazy image of the couple lost in their intimate embrace.",
    "1237": "**Emily hesitates on her house steps**, her eyes meeting Ben's apologetic gaze below. She wears a look of disappointment, and after a brief pause, turns away and enters the house, leaving Ben to stare at the closed door. Frustrated, **he climbs into his car, aggressively secures his seat belt, and screams out his emotions**.\n\nInside, **Emily clears the dinner table**, leaving Kate, the middle-aged nurse, sitting alone as she glimpses Ben working in the garden. Intrigued, **she ventures out through the French windows into the vibrant garden**, finding Ben, sleeves rolled up, diligently pulling weeds. **He smiles as he works**, and Emily watches him, her expression softening.\n\n**She leads him to a padlocked workshop**, and as they enter, sunlight illuminates the dusty letter presses within. **Emily selects a sheet of paper**, activates the flywheel, and **prints an image of an angelic woman adorned with butterfly wings**. Ben examines the artwork, and as their eyes meet, **Emily grins playfully**.\n\nLater, **in a sprawling, sun-drenched field**, Emily sits amidst the tall grass, observing **Ben and Duke, his dog, playing fetch**. Her grin widens as she enjoys their joyful antics. **They retreat to the cool shade of a tree**, Duke panting contentedly beside them. Ben's gaze lingers on Emily as **she wraps her cardigan around her**, toying with a blade of grass. **Their eyes meet again**, and a silent understanding passes between them.\n\n**Emily's long, dark hair accentuates her gentle features** as she tucks a stray lock behind her ear. **Ben listens intently as she speaks**, then lowers his gaze. **She looks down, smiling sadly**. Tentatively, **Ben reaches out, gently caressing her hair**.\n\n**As they pull up to Emily's charming clapboard house**, Duke's head pokes out of the car window, and **she offers Ben a tender, uncertain smile**. Leaning in, **she kisses him on the cheek**, leaving him visibly moved. **She unloads Duke from the back seat**, peering through the open window at Ben before walking away. **He watches her go**, a pensve expression on his face, then **departs with a faint smile**.\n\n**Ben later returns**, parking outside Emily's home. **With a bag slung over his shoulder**, he makes his way through the garden towards the workshop, **guidied by the warm light emanating from the house**.",
    "1238": "In the wake of England's failure to qualify for the World Cup, a grim mood settles over the nation. The search for a new manager begins, with one clear front-runner. Under the dreary Yorkshire sky, the Leeds United stadium stands empty, its muddy pitch drenched by rain. Inside, cameras flash as Don Revie, flanked by board members, makes his way to a press conference, casually acknowledging the media's attention. Meanwhile, Manny Cussins, the board's director, sits uncomfortably before the press, his gaunt face etched with tension.\n\nSimultaneously, a Ford Zodiac cruises along a moorland road, its driver, Brian Clough, singing along to the radio while his two sons watch the rain-soaked world outside. They pass the Leeds United stadium without pause. Later, in the Yorkshire television studios, Brian's wry smile contrasts sharply with Don's livid expression as he watches from home, storming to the phone in fury.\n\nBack at Elland Road, Brian's arrival causes a stir. Boys chase after his car as it pulls into the parking lot, and reporters swarm as Jimmy Gordon, his assistant, opens the door. Brian and his sons step out, waving at the scowling footballers on the training field before turning to face the press. Undeterred by the board's glares, Brian struts into the boardroom, his broad grin unwavering as he takes his seat.\n\nFlashing back six years earlier, Brian is seen at Derby County's rundown stadium. He marches through the dilapidated visitors' entrance, dashed down corridors past smoking cleaners, and onto the pitch where the groundsman is marking lines. Surveying the team alongside Peter Taylor, Brian demonstrates his skill by volleying a goal.\n\nWith unyielding determination, Brian sets to work transforming the stadium. Clad in his trademark red tracksuit, he scrubs the corridors clean, polishes the brass plaque on the visitors' door, and even scours the shower room tiles. Capping off his efforts, he places an orange and a heavy glass ashtray on each neatly folded towel before admiring his reflection in his office mirror, smoothing his hair with a grave expression.",
    "1239": "In the confines of a wood-paneled office, Brian meticulously smooths his tie and carefully retrieves two crystal glasses from his case, while Peter observes. He places the glasses side by side, then unwraps a bottle of red wine, blowing off the dust as he does so. The bottle is gently positioned to the right of the glasses, its label turned to face Peter at the door. Suddenly, Jimmy ducks into the room, prompting Brian to hastily put on his suit jacket as he and Peter follow Jimmy out of the office. They quickly exit through a side door in the rusty, corrugated iron stand, hurrying towards the entrance gate.\n\nA coach is parked down the street, lined with terraced houses. Brian smooths his dark hair and straightens his tailored suit jacket as he stands with Peter and Jimmy at the entrance. Down the street, kids gather around Don and his team, who are stepping off the coach and strolling towards the ground in their smart suits, pausing to sign autographs. A press photographer captures the moment as the players approach. Brian steps forward to greet them, but Don sweeps past to meet his entourage, leaving Brian standing alone at the entrance.\n\nBrian, still seething, watches the teams run out, his eyes fixed on Don in the visitor's dugout. Peter yells beside a glowering Brian as the Leeds players surround the ref. The physio carries McFarland off, piggyback, prompting Brian to grimace introspectively. He sneers at Don, while the wine in the office remains untouched. Brian gazes out at Don ushering his players onto their coach, patting their backs for the press. He nods ruefully, then jabs a finger at Peter.\n\nThe scene shifts to the rolling Derbyshire countryside, where the Clough family sits at a dining table in a semi-detached house. Peter glances at his wife, while Brian smirks. Barbara Clough gets up from the table and wanders into the hall, finding it empty. Brian speeds away from Peter's house, with Peter feeding him crisps as he drives. Brian takes a swig from a can of lager. They pull up in a suburban street, where Brian and Peter swap grins as the thick-set Dave Mackay opens his front door, regarding them with a stern expression.\n\nUnder Brian's watchful eye, Derby players hit a ball and run up and down the stands. Sam Longson joins Brian on the terraces as press shots are taken of the team in their kit. Dave is on the training field, and grainy black and white match footage shows Derby climbing the table. Brian and Jimmy applaud as the team reaches the top of the table. Champagne flows in the dressing room, and a party ensues in the board room. Having emptied a bottle of champagne into the silver cup, Brian pours it into the players' glasses. Peter smokes a cigarillo as he embraces Brian, and they dance together while their wives and the team look on. Meanwhile, Dave rushes forward to turn up the sound on the TV, where Don is accepting a trophy. The Leeds players, in tracksuits, are on the training ground near the stadium.",

    "1241": "In the tense moments before a crucial match, the clock ticks to five past four, and Brian anxiously paces in his office, cigarette dangling from his lips, hands clasped behind his head. He alternates his gaze between the office floor and the clock, his tension palpable. Suddenly, he looks up in awe as silhouettes of celebrating fans leap to their feet, their joyous forms crowding the frosted windows. The clock ticks to half past four, and Brian, now seated, buries his head in his hands, a picture of despair. Rising once more, he gazes at the cheering Derby fans before bowing his head against the wall, resuming his pacing in the light streaming through the windows, hands still clasped on his head.\n\nPreparing to face the world, Brian puts on his jacket, straightens his tie, and steps into the corridor. He pauses to smooth his hair before striding down the gloomy, brick-walled passage. Abruptly, he stops as he sees Jimmy and Peter turn the corner ahead. Jimmy strolls off, leaving Peter frowning at Brian. Peter's expression softens into a grin, and Brian, beaming, runs to embrace him.\n\nThe atmosphere in the dressing room is electric as the team cheers loudly. News of their victory spreads via Telex, and match footage rolls. Brian appears in a TV interview, his elation clear as legendary host Parkinson grins alongside him. Derby climbs the table to the top, and Brian is interviewed again, the triumph resonating through every word. The crowds welcome the Derby team bus back with the cup, their jubilation echoing through the streets.\n\nThe public's adoration is undeniable as crowds flock down the mile to Wembley for the charity shield, the event broadcast in vibrant color TV footage. Jimmy follows Brian into the Leeds dressing room, where Brian pulls a note from his blazer pocket. The team turns grudgingly, their reluctance evident. Brian grins and winks, his confidence unshaken. Bremner shoots a dour glance at Giles, the tension between them thick.\n\nAs the teams come out, Bremner scratches himself crudely, eyeing Brown contemptuously while the national anthem plays. In the stands, Don sings robustly, but on the pitch, Brian remains tight-lipped, his eyes locked with Don's. Brian smirks wryly as Don looks away imperiously. Bremner salutes Don, who smiles back smugly, touching his nose. The Leeds team jig in a circle, their right arms raised to the fans, a show of solidarity and defiance.\n\nOn the edge of the Leeds area, Liverpool presses forward, but off the ball, Giles punches Keegan to the floor. Brian closes his eyes in frustration, commentators watching as he mutters furiously. Despite the chaos, Emlyn Hughes lifts the shield, a symbol of victory amidst the turmoil. Brian is patted consolingly on the shoulder, a small comfort amidst the disappointment.\n\nAt an FA tribunal, the row of gray-haired men in blazers rise, their decision made. Bremner trudges out after the officials, leaving Brian sitting alone, brooding over the outcome. Back in his hotel suite, Brian is on the phone, Peter listening intently on the other end. Brian takes a swig of booze, his movements sharp with agitation. Peter's eyes rove in anguish, his brows knit in a deep frown. The call ends abruptly, leaving Brian hunched over on his hotel bed, head in hand, the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nLater, by the dressing rooms, Brian nods sagely, leaning close to impart his wisdom. With a determined stride, he walks towards the players' tunnel, ready to face whatever comes next.",
    "1246": "Miranda confidently strides through the foyer, making a beeline for the lift, while a staff member waits for another. Removing her designer shades, Miranda is swiftly greeted by Emily, who dashes to meet her. Emily quickly finds Andy, anxiously clutching her resume, snatches her briefcase, and ushers her into the bright, airy office adorned with black-and-white framed photos. Miranda scrutinizes Andy's attire before turning her attention to black-clad Nigel, all while flipping through a magazine. Andy, visibly nervous, frowns and briefly heads for the door before returning.\n\nLater, Andy hands in her pass at the reception desk and begins to leave, only for Emily to appear and beckon her back. That evening, Andy dines with Nate and two friends, only to be awakened the next morning at 6:15 AM by her phone. She hurriedly walks down the street, balancing four coffees. At the office, two women wheel in a clothes rail for Miranda, who emerges from her office as Emily calls Andy. Andy watches Emily bring the coffees into Miranda's office, then rushes to her desk facing Emily's, now dressed in a bright blue jumper.\n\nNigel steps in, providing Andy with black stilettos. As Andy hurries into Miranda's office, Miranda stiffens, her eyes critically assessing Andy's plaid skirt, black tights, and sensible black flat shoes. Andy quickly retreats, swapping her flats for the stilettos. Emily takes charge, but Miranda rolls her eyes, leaving Andy visibly hurt.\n\nA sleek, chauffeur-driven car delivers Andy to the Calvin Klein showroom on 7th Avenue, her phone ringing just as she exits. She navigates heavy traffic and struggles back into the office, laden with large bags and four coffees. Miranda breezes in, casually dropping her coat and bag onto Andy's desk. Well-dressed Serena saunters off with Emily, leaving Andy to later venture down to the canteen. She’s found by Nigel, who sees her helping herself to soup. They exchange smiles as Andy grabs a roll but accidentally gets soup on her jumper.\n\nBack at the office, Miranda vets outfits, including a dress, while Andy notices the similarity of two blue belts, her smile quickly fading. At home, Nate hands her a sandwich. The next day, Andy is back at her desk, and after a brief interaction with Emily and a delivery, she has dinner with her father, accepting cash from him before they head to the theater.\n\nIn a poignant moment, holding back tears, Andy walks out of Miranda's office, passing through the anteroom and by Emily's desk. She traverses the editorial department, pausing by Nigel's glass-walled office, where he is meticulously examining contact sheets on an illuminated desktop.",
    "1258": "In the quiet of a music venue backstage, cluttered with equipment, a couple begins a intimate journey. Hand in hand, Carl and Allison emerge from the wings onto the stage of the Hollywood Bowl, their senses overwhelmed by the vast amphitheater. Beneath the stage's grand arch, they share a moment of awe, smiling at the spectacle before them. Allison, lost in thought, stares at the sea of empty seats, and Carl gazes at her, captivated. She turns to him, their smiles meeting, and they continue to take in the view.\n\nIn a tender, unhurried dance of connection, they turn towards each other. Allison looks up at Carl, and leaning in, she kisses him softly. An impish smile graces her lips as she pulls back, sparking a more passionate, yet tender kiss from Carl. They embrace, holding each other tightly, and sink to the floor, the deserted amphitheater their sole witness. But their moment is interrupted when a portly security guard, flashlight in hand, chases them away.\n\nIn the stark contrast of his office, Carl is seen handing out oranges to a queue of people. Lee's smile fades, and Norman stands po-faced as a motorbike sound is heard. Carl and Norman then step into an office, where a mustachioed man awaits. After a handshake, the three—Wesley, Carl, and Norman—take their seats at a large table. Carl's smile, Norman's gawking, and his eventual nod frame the scene. Meanwhile, Carl and Lucy pore over bridal shower invitations, exchanging a sad look and a sympathetic nod. Soo-Mi grins nearby as Carl holds up a clenched fist, resolute.\n\nA sudden commotion: a guy runs in, and Carl merges with the crowd outside. Standing on the street, his resolve steely, Carl bursts into a tall, red-brick apartment building. Racing up the stairs, he finds a desperate man on a ledge outside the top floor. Inside the cluttered apartment, Carl scans the room and spots a guitar. Leaning out of an arched window, he assesses the casual, portly figure with thick black hair perched precariously outside.\n\nDown below, Soo-Mi and Lucy stand in the anxious crowd, eyes fixed upward. Carl tunes the guitar and leans back out of the window, instrument in hand. As a fire crew arrives and the crowd sings along, the man on the ledge inches towards the window. With a swift grab of the man's jacket, Carl throws him to safety inside the room. The man, shocked, holds up his hands defensively.\n\nLater, Carl exits an airport shuttle bus, only to have Stephanie, accompanied by Ted, grab his arm as he heads towards the terminal. Carl departs, but Stephanie glances back as she walks away, leaving the future uncertain but the memory of their shared journey indelible.",
    "1259": "In the quaint Lincoln, Nebraska airport, Carl approaches Allison, who is distinctively dressed in a dark blue coat adorned with red piping. With a swift, confident motion, he sweeps her up around the waist with one arm and carries her effortlessly to the check-in desk. The woman behind the desk glances at her computer screen, leaving Carl visibly perplexed. Despite this brief confusion, Carl and Allison traverse the small airport together.\n\nTheir journey leads them to the Telephone Pioneer Museum, where a detailed mock-up of an early telephone switchboard is on display. Beside it, a mannequin incongruously holds a modern mobile phone. Carl, holding up a real vintage phone, showcases its massive size.\n\nThe scene shifts to a shooting range, where Allison initially shoots at the ground. An instructor carefully adjusts her gun barrel, enabling her to hit the clay target. Chaos ensues momentarily as everyone ducks when she accidentally swings the gun around.\n\nIn a burst of energy, a uniformed band performs at the packed Nebraska Cornhuskers Memorial Stadium. A lively mascot jumps up and down as the football team, decked out in red-and-white stripes, runs onto the field. Inside Carl's apartment, Peter, Lucy, Rooney, and Lee watch the game on TV, while Carl, lost in the crowd's fervor, wears giant yellow corncobs on his head and arms. Beside him, Allison dons a massive red Stetson, blending into the spirited atmosphere.\n\nThe narrative takes a grim turn at a slaughterhouse, where Carl faints. Later, under a brooding gray sky, Carl and Allison walk along a country track. In a protective gesture, he takes off his jacket and wraps it around Allison's head, marching her to a nearby barn. Upon removing the jacket, Allison shakes her head, but Carl smiles broadly. She leans against him, smiling contentedly, and they embrace, their arms wrapping around each other. Carl, thoughtful, rests his chin upon her hair.\n\nBack at the airport check-in desk, Carl and Allison face a uniformed woman with thick, fair hair. She checks her computer screen and smiles at them, but two serious-looking, suited men walk over and show their IDs. Carl, pointing at Allison, starts to smile before the scene transitions to an interrogation room.\n\nInside, a thick-set man named Tweed narrows his eyes as Allison looks at Carl, clearly disappointed. Carl and Allison sit handcuffed, and soon Peter, Tweed, and another man named Multack exit the room. Carl manages a weak smile, but his eyes reflect a wretched gaze.\n\nMultack re-enters and unlocks Allison's handcuffs. Without a backward glance, she stands up and leaves the room. A jet touches down in LA, and Allison marches through the bustling terminal building, with Carl and Peter following some distance behind. Carl retreats as Allison gets into a yellow cab, leaving Peter to watch as Carl races back through the terminal.\n\nCarl's desolation deepens as he watches a film, calls Allison, and sits staring at a table during a meeting. Allison, meanwhile, stands on the terrace outside her apartment, absorbed in painting at an easel. She checks her phone, sees it's Carl calling, and places it back on the table without answering.\n\nIn a desperate attempt to find solace, Carl takes a flying lesson but appears uninterested. He stands on the edge of a bridge, a harness secured around his waist and ankles, attached to a bungee rope, contemplating his next move.",
    "1261": "In a sudden, violent moment, a car slams into the side of their vehicle, sending them spinning. Carl, unconscious and bearing facial abrasions, lies in a hospital bed. A nurse in blue scrubs checks his pulse, her pretty face etched with concern, while Peter and Rooney sit vigilantly by his side, the latter snacking while Peter holds a drink. As the nurse walks away, Rooney's gaze follows her. Suddenly, Carl stirs, a look of fear flickering across his face. Terrence, wearing a hospital gown, pulls back the curtain, prompting Carl to hastily exit the bed. Peter's gaze shifts to Terrence, who also takes his leave. Rooney, seizing the opportunity, climbs into the bed and hushes Peter.\n\nMeanwhile, Carl, with a growing sense of urgency, darts out of the room. He makes a mad dash for the elevator, narrowly missing Lee, who is just stepping out. In a flurry of action, Carl, still clad in his hospital gown, commandeers Lee's Ducati bike, revving the engine and donning a helmet. With a rebellious spirit, he pulls a wheelie and speeds off, crashing through a barrier and exiting the hospital parking lot.\n\nCarl's reckless ride continues as he pulls up alongside a UPS van, the driver staring in disbelief at the Ducati's front wheel wobbling in midair. Dropping the wheel down, Carl races through the town, weaving dangerously through traffic and mounting the pavement, sending pedestrians scattering. A car abruptly pulls out in front of him, forcing Carl to brake hard, the back wheel lifting off the ground as he decelerates. Once the car passes, he resumes his wheelie and continues his precarious journey, eventually merging onto a dual carriageway. His spotted hospital gown flaps in the breeze, revealing more than intended as the gown's ties flutter above his waist. Carl's powerful Ducati, a hybrid of a trail and road bike, roars beneath him as he keeps his head low and arms bent, completely focused on his escape.\n\nHis destination? A grand, domed observatory where Allison is leading a warm-up session with her jogging photographers. Making a dramatic entrance, Carl performs a series of donuts, the bike's back wheel spinning and creating a thick cloud of burnt-rubber smoke. Allison and her group stare in shock as Carl emerges from the smoky haze, his heavy-browed expression unreadable. He strides towards Allison, the photographers dispersing as Carl grins and jogs up to her. Despite her initial frown, Allison can't help but smile back as they reach a scenic viewpoint overlooking the city. They share a tender, lingering kiss, their arms wrapping around each other.\n\nReggie, raising his hand in apology, intrudes on their moment as he and the other photographers snap pictures of the embracing couple, the city sprawling out behind them. Ever so slightly, Carl reaches around and tugs at his gown, ensuring his modesty remains intact amidst the chaotic, yet strangely romantic, scene.\n\nLater, outside a homeless shelter, Norm stands with Soo-Mi, who meticulously sorts through clothes, their connection to Carl and Allison's escapade yet to be revealed.",
    "1263": "In the dimly lit chamber, Voldemort casts a glance at his serpent, Nagini, before the two vanish abruptly. Meanwhile, Harry, unable to stop shivering, is approached by a disheveled and dirty Hermione and Ron. Hermione, anxious, turns to Ron, who crouches beside Harry. The boy's worry is evident as Hermione also squats down beside him. Harry, trying to compose himself, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, his jaw tense.\n\nThe scene shifts to a tranquil boathouse where a small boat is docked. Inside, Nagini is coiled up, and Lucius Malfoy stands with Voldemort, who examines his own forearm intently. Back with Harry, he opens his eyes to find his friends staring at him anxiously.\n\nThe once peaceful Hogwarts is now under siege. Death Eaters swoop over the school grounds, as a lone student flies in on a broomstick. A colossal giant wields a scythe, while fierce battles erupt on the staircases. Hermione dashes out through a door, narrowly avoiding a deadly bolt. Harry, fighting back, beats on a door and shoots a Death Eater. A giant armed with a double-headed weapon spots the trio and gives chase, forcing them to hide inside an enormous bell lying on its side. The giant's weapon clangs against the bell, but the creature retreats as massive spiders emerge from the rubble.\n\nHermione darts between the giants' legs, and the trio fends off attacks with their wands, reaching a quieter area. They halt upon seeing a Death Eater leaning over a girl's body. The werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, looks up, but Hermione swiftly casts a spell, sending him crashing through a window. The trio races through a closed-end walkway, pursued by the relentless giants smashing the walls. Reaching the front of the school, they see Dementors flying towards them, but a shimmering barrier is swiftly conjured by Aberforth Dumbledore, who turns back to continue the fight.\n\nThe trio sprints away, descending steps towards the boathouse lights. Inside, Voldemort circles Snape, who maintains steady eye contact. With a swift slicing move of the Elder Wand, Voldemort sends Snape crashing against a glass-paneled wall. Harry, on the other side, watches helplessly as Nagini lunges repeatedly at Snape, who slides down the window, leaving a bloody streak.\n\nEntering the boathouse, Harry approaches the severely injured Snape. Kneeling, Harry attempts to staunch a wound on Snape's neck. The dying man turns his head to look at Harry, a tear rolling down his cheek. Hermione, rummaging through her bag, pulls out a small phial as Harry gazes deeply into Snape's eyes, the weight of the moment hanging heavy in the air.",
    "1267": "Harry casts a glance backwards, retracing their steps. Ahead, Dumbledore has moved on, his back turned to Harry. As Harry begins to rise, Dumbledore swiftly spins around, a warm smile spreading across his face. He raises his eyebrows, nods reassuringly, and then backs away, turning once more before vanishing into the blanket of white.\n\nMeanwhile, in the heart of the forest, Lord Voldemort lies prone on the cold ground. With a forceful shove, he pushes Bellatrix aside and catches sight of Harry, unmoving. Narcissa Malfoy advances towards Harry's still form, her eyes locked onto him. Bellatrix watches intently as Narcissa bends down, pressing her fingers against Harry's neck to check for a pulse. A flicker of realization crosses her face, and she nods subtly, lingering for a moment before standing up to face Voldemort, her expression grave.\n\nIn the courtyard, a lone figure stumbles over the debris – it is Neville. He stoops to retrieve the Sorting Hat, gingerly dusting it off and peering inside, a reflection of thoughts dancing across his face. Catching sight of a slow procession in the distance, he takes the lead, guiding the group back towards the school. Voldemort callously shifts a giant's corpse, clearing a path for his army of Death Eaters to march across the bridge. Neville, still gripping the Sorting Hat, slinks into the courtyard alongside Voldemort.\n\nArthur protectively pulls Ginny back, while Ron and Hermione stand aghast, their mouths open in horror. Voldemort addresses his Death Eaters, Lucius Malfoy crying out as every gaze shifts to his son, Draco. With a determined stretch of his hand, Lucius strides towards his family, his lips pursed. Under McGonagall's watchful eye, Draco reunites with his parents, Narcissa guiding him into the sea of Death Eaters.\n\nNeville inches forward, his glare fixed on Seamus, hand clasped to his heart. With defiance blazing in his eyes, he confronts Voldemort, drawing the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat. Simultaneously, Harry leaps from Hagrid's grasp, his spell ricocheting off Nagini. Darting for cover, Harry's escape is impeded by Voldemort's fiery barrage. Amidst the chaos, several Death Eaters flee, students scattering into the school as Shacklebolt wards off the attackers. A stray flash strikes the Sword of Gryffindor, sending Neville sprawling backwards, while the Malfoys retreat across the bridge.\n\nAlone, Harry clutches his wand, his steps uncertain as he backs away. Hearing a noise, he whirls around, firing a spell that strikes a door frame. Three lifeless bodies litter the ground. As Voldemort materializes at the main staircase, Harry darts behind a wall, gripping a Basilisk fang. Steeling himself, he steps out as Voldemort ascends, their energy blasts clashing like a furious sword fight.\n\nVoldemort presses forward, Nagini slithering in his wake. Vanishing suddenly, he reappears above Harry on the stairs, their energy blasts locked in a deadly struggle. Harry is driven backwards, Nagini inching ever closer up the stairs towards him.",
    "1268": "In a swift sequence of events, a blast is deflected onto the ceiling, causing stone beams to crash onto the staircase. Harry, clutching the Basilisk fang, steadies himself, but Voldemort spots the fang and fires, sending Harry tumbling onto a lower staircase where he drops the precious item. Voldemort swiftly destroys the fang, and in the ensuing chaos, Harry vanishes from the Dark Lord's sight, prompting Voldemort to disapparate. Meanwhile, Nagini, Voldemort's serpentine companion, slithers across a landing, only to be struck by a stone. The snake turns and looks over the edge of the stairs, where Hermione stands alone on a landing below. She hurls another stone as Nagini descends, while nearby, the unconscious Neville begins to stir, oblivious to the battle around him.\n\nA burning body floats past Neville, catching his attention. As he turns his head, he spots the Sword of Gryffindor on the ground behind him. Elsewhere, Voldemort lands and takes aim, causing the walkway to collapse and sending Harry plummeting to the floor below. As Harry scrambles away, Voldemort's black cloak ensnares him, restraining his wrists and neck. The Dark Lord reins Harry in, while Nagini advances on Hermione, who retreats with a Basilisk fang in hand. Ron, also wielding a fang, creeps up the stairs towards the snake, but Nagini turns on him, forcing Ron to flee and drop his fang. The snake rears up menacingly between Ron and Hermione.\n\nIn another part of the school, Bellatrix and Ginny are locked in a fierce duel. Molly steps in, taking Ginny's place, and the two exchange powerful energy blasts on a narrow platform. Bellatrix seems to have the upper hand, but Molly advances wildly, striking the Death Eater multiple times. With a final wave of her wand, Molly reduces Bellatrix to a myriad of tiny black fragments, leaving Molly grinning in triumph.\n\nBack on the walkway, Voldemort unleashes his physical strength against Harry, slapping and kicking him. Harry scrambles backward, but in a daring move, he flings his arms around Voldemort's neck and jumps off the edge of the ramparts. They plummet from the heights, Voldemort struggling to break free as they claw at each other's faces, zooming above the school. Harry seems to split Voldemort's head, revealing only black smoke, as they land in the courtyard and roll away from each other across the cobbles.\n\nExhausted, both crawl towards their wands. Voldemort reaches the Elder Wand just before Harry reaches his own. On their knees, they fire at each other, resulting in a burst of green energy from the Elder Wand met by a burst of red from Harry's, culminating in a bright white ball of light. Inside the school, Nagini chases Hermione and Ron downstairs, and as the duo falls, the snake raises her head, mouth open, ready to strike.",
    "1269": "In the gripping climax of the movie, Neville wields the sword of Gryffindor, and a dark cloud of smoke erupts, revealing Hermione amidst the debris. The power of the Elder Wand begins to wane, and in the courtyard, Voldemort stumbles, overwhelmed. Harry turns to confront him, witnessing the Dark Lord's face contort with rage. Their spells clash in a blaze of white and orange light. Harry, empowered, advances relentlessly. Voldemort is driven back as the Elder Wand's energy flickers and dies. With a flick of his wand, Harry sends the Elder Wand spinning through the air. Voldemort starts to crumble, his skull fragmenting as his body and clothes disintegrate into countless tiny pieces that float away like ashes in the morning sun.\n\nInside Hogwarts, exhausted students slump on the stairs. Neville, still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, smiles as Luna sits shyly beside him. Harry, holding a mug, wanders through the Great Hall, his face marked with dried blood. He smiles at the sight of the united Weasley family and walks past chattering students. Cho Chang offers him a weak smile, while Aberforth converses with Dean and Seamus. Harry pauses in front of Hagrid, who envelops him in a warm embrace before walking away. Filch futilely attempts to clear a mountain of rubble.\n\nHermione and Ron enter the Great Hall, and Harry grins, noticing their clasped hands. Hermione glances down, shyly. The three friends venture outside into the brilliant sunshine, strolling along the ruined bridge. Harry steps onto a broken stone support, gazing into the distance. He nods to himself, holding the Elder Wand. After a moment of contemplation, he snaps the wand in two and tosses the pieces into the chasm below. Nodding again, he turns to his friends before jumping down onto the bridge and walking away. Hermione and Ron watch him, and as he glances back, Hermione strides up to him, taking his hand with admiration. Ron joins them, and the three stand united on the rubble-strewn bridge, the ruined school behind them, gazing ahead towards an uncertain but hopeful future.\n\nThe scene shifts to the grand St. Pancras Hotel, its clock tower standing tall. Inside the bustling King's Cross Station, a dark-haired, 11-year-old boy in a striped shirt pushes a trolley laden with luggage and an animal cage along the platform, ready for a new adventure.",
    "1262": "In the shadow of dark mountains, the waters of Hogwarts' lake ripple gently, revealing a small island on the far side, where a white marble tomb stands solitary. Suddenly, a large marble block slides back, and supports beneath it tumble away, allowing Dark Lord Voldemort to lean into the tomb. He admires the black Elder Wand in his hand before thrusting it skyward, releasing a massive force of energy that illuminates the dark sky. Meanwhile, hovering Dementors, cloaked in tattered black robes, encircle Hogwarts, casting an ominous shadow over the school.\n\nFrom an upper archway, Severus Snape, dressed in a black tunic and gown, gazes out at the mist-shrouded mountains as subdued students march across the courtyard in regimented ranks. Snape's somber expression watches their procession. Elsewhere, Harry Potter kneels at the foot of a grave, examining a piece of broken mirror. He sees his reflection morph into another face. The grave is located among sand dunes behind a small house—Shell Cottage—which faces a white beach and the vast sea beyond.\n\nInside Shell Cottage, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the lounge, while Luna Lovegood saunters up to a set of hanging chimes. Bill, Ron's brother, is in the kitchen with his wife, Fleur. Harry enters and faces Bill, who then leads Harry, Hermione, and Ron into a room where Griphook, a goblin with pointed ears and a long beaky nose, sits in an armchair, hands clasped and eyes closed. As they enter, Griphook grips the chair's arms, his long, filthy nails digging into the surface. He stares at Harry, who is drawn to the sword of Gryffindor leaning against the wall. Griphook's eyes flick to the sword, and he points at it, drawing Harry's attention back to the weapon.\n\nLater, downstairs in the kitchen, Fleur ushers them into another room where the old wandmaker, Ollivander, sits by a window. Harry hands him two wands—a curved one and a plain, straight one—which Ollivander examines closely. After scrutinizing them, he returns the wands to Harry, leaning forward with widened eyes, staring solemnly at the young man. As Harry gets up to leave, Hermione is seen holding a long strand of curling, black hair, hinting at their next steps in the unfolding tale.",
    "1273": "In the dimly lit room, Hermione turns to Aberforth, who nods in agreement. She then faces Harry, and together they scrutinize the painting intently. Hermione squints, examining it closely. They step back, and as they do, the girl in the portrait springs to life, and the entire frame swings open like a door, unveiling the entrance to a hidden tunnel.\n\nWithin the tunnel, Neville, his face marred by bruises, turns to his companions. He opens a gold-framed painting, revealing a long, dark passage with a distant pinprick of light. Neville steps aside, and Harry emerges, discovering a large room filled with students resting in hammocks. As Harry descends, the students take turns embracing him. Neville approaches one student, who hurriedly moves to a radio. Harry, uncomfortable with the attention, turns to the sea of expectant faces. Just then, Ginny Weasley bursts into the room, her eyes fixed on Harry, barely acknowledging Ron's presence.\n\nMeanwhile, at Hogwarts, lines of students march across the courtyard and down the grand staircase towards the great hall, closely monitored by the Death Eater, Amycus Carrow. Inside the hall, staff and students are assembled, and Severus Snape paces between the rows, flanked by Amycus Carrow and his sister, Alecto. The students murmur amongst themselves, while those who had met Harry, including Cho, Ginny, and Seamus, stare at the floor. A student in a gown steps forward to confront Snape.\n\nSuddenly, Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, Shacklebolt, and Remus march in, wands drawn. Professor McGonagall pushes Harry aside, facing Snape head-on. Wands are raised at the door, and McGonagall fires a burst of energy, which Snape deflects, sending the Carrows reeling. With a swirl of his black cloak, Snape spins and takes flight, soaring out through a high window.\n\nHarry casts off his gown as torches blaze and students cheer. But the celebration is short-lived; the room darkens, and Harry sits, his face ashen, eyes wide with tension. Students look up apprehensively as ominous clouds gather in the sky. McGonagall watches anxiously while a girl screams, then another. The gloom lifts, and the great hall is once again illuminated by flaming torches. Students back away from Harry, but Ginny moves protectively in front of him, followed by Hermione and more students.\n\nFilch, the caretaker, rushes in, and Harry strides up to McGonagall. On his way out, he pauses, then leads the way out of the hall. Characters abandon their portraits, scuttling away, and students rush down the stairs. Fighting against the tide, Harry pushes his way up, handing Ron the Marauder's Map before setting off once more.",
    "1274": "Hermione and Ron descend the stairs, while Luna trails behind Harry. Reaching the courtyard, she turns to face the school. Suddenly, colossal stone statues of warriors brandishing enormous weapons crash onto the paved terrace by the main entrance. The stone guardians march down the steps towards the courtyard. Professor Flitwick hurriedly traverses the cobbled courtyard, his wand aloft. Professors Slughorn and Molly mimic his actions, accompanied by students gaping at the sky. Flashes of light erupt from their wands, causing the clouds to converge and form an expansive protective shield over the school and its grounds, repelling even a prowling Dementor.\n\nInside, Harry pushes against the stream of students, ascending a spiral staircase. Luna joins him, and together they witness the glowing protective shield slowly descending through a window. Below, Professor Flitwick keeps watch as the shield ascends. Framed by torches, the duo observes the enchantment in silence. Harry's shadow dances against the wall as he proceeds along a dim corridor, the only illumination spilling from tall windows on his right.\n\nApproaching a stone doorway, Harry encounters a ghostly, dark-haired woman in a gray dress suspended by a window. She morphs into a ball of light, passing through him before pausing, her face etched with worry and anxiety. Outside, the night is nearly pitch black, the lights of Hogwarts a dim glow in the distance. Upon a rocky outcrop, an army of Death Eaters stands, gazing down at the school. They part as Voldemort, trailed by Bellatrix, advances to the cliff's edge. Voldemort turns, casting a menacing glare at Pius Thicknesse, who retreats. The Death Eaters unleash a barrage of light bolts, like shooting stars raining down upon the protective shield.\n\nBack inside, Harry exchanges glances with the ghostly Helena before she drifts away. Pursuing her, he rounds a walkway and leaps onto a low wall. She retreats, floating out onto the walkway with her back to him. Turning stiffly, she scrutinizes his weary face before moving closer, only to float away again. Transforming into a ball of light, she speeds off, and Harry rushes down the spiral staircase.\n\nMeanwhile, Kingsley Shacklebolt stands with Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas, staring up as Death Eaters' bolts strike the shield. Nearby, the Weasley twins, George and Fred, also watch the sky in tense anticipation. Hermione remains behind Ron at a door adorned with six large, metal snakes, as the battle for Hogwarts escalates.",
    "1275": "In the eerie silence, sinuous snake locks begin to stir, activating an ancient mechanism. Ponderously, the heavy, circular stone door of the Chamber of Secrets grinds open, revealing the dark passage beyond. Meanwhile, on the dark hillside, the protective shield cast by the burning wooden ground stones from the Quidditch Pitch blazes defiantly, as sinister illusions relentlessly pound against it. Neville Longbottom, standing sentinel on a covered wooden bridge, surveys the ominous landscape. His heart pounds as he spots an army of Snatchers, led by the ruthless Scabior, charging towards the school. Neville flinches as two Snatchers, racing ahead, hit the shield and disintegrate in a flash of light. Scabior, taken aback, pauses to steady his men, his gazelocked onto Neville, who bravely guards the entrance.\n\nDeep within the Chamber of Secrets, Ron Weasley approaches the colossal skeleton of the Basilisk. With a grunt, he wrests a great fang from its gaping jaw. Hermione Granger, meantime, retrieves the two-handled golden cup of Helga Hufflepuff from her enchanted bag. Ron passes her the fang and, kneeling, places the cup on the cold stone floor. Hermione hesitates, staring at the cup, before drawing back her arm and plunging the fang into it. The cup, now a Horcrux, spins across the floor as Lord Voldemort's distant roar echoes through the chamber. Water bursts forth, flooding the chamber, and Harry Potter gasps, reeling back as the Dark Lord appears in the swelling torrent, breathing deeply. Harry, drained, leans against a pillar for support. Behind the receding waters, Ron and Hermione turn to each other, kissing passionately, as if standing on a bridge with waters raging on either side.\n\nAbove ground, Lord Voldemort, Nagini coiled menacingly beside him, unleashes a powerful blast of light from the Elder Wand towards the protective shield. Professor McGonagall and Ginny Weasley stare upwards in horror as parts of the shield begin to burn and crumble. Remus Lupin reaches out to Nymphadora Tonks, their fingers nearly touching. Suddenly, Voldemort recoils, glaring down at the Elder Wand as energy crackles through its nut-nutted length. The shield, now a burning dome of flame, fills the skies with fiery debris.\n\nHarry, gathering his strength, moves with renewed determination through the fleeing students. Scabior, seizing the opportunity, catches one of the flaming embers on his wand tip, scowling at Neville, who remains steadfast on the wooden bridge. The Snatcher takes a tentative step forward, grinning maliciously. Neville backs away as the Snatchers hurl fireballs at him, which he deftly dodges. With a swift incantation, Neville's wand ignites charges in the bridge supports, setting off a chain reaction of explosions. Scabior quickens his pace as the bridge collapses behind him. Ginny and the others watch anxiously as Neville sprints towards them, a massive explosion ripping the bridge apart just as he reaches safety.",
    "1276": "In the grips of terror, they gaze at the yawning chasm before them. Suddenly, a hand lobs a wand up, followed by another hand, and finally, Neville's head emerges as he hauls himself up. Meanwhile, an ominous army of Dementors, Death Eaters, and Giants advances towards the school from the opposite side. Professor Flitwick retreats between the ranks of the Stone Army as a Giant closes in. Vines suddenly lash up the giant, securing it to the ground. Death Eaters dive down, firing blasts of green light at the Stone Warriors. Two audacious giants swing massive weapons, sending people flying and carving through the Stone Army to chase the diminutive Professor Flitwick.\n\nAn explosion tears through the courtyard, sending people scattering for cover as parts of the school catch fire. Death Eaters storm into a tower, where Arthur Weasley fights one off. Kingsley Shacklebolt levitates another Death Eater mid-air, then hurls him back out the window. Harry, rushing downstairs, turns and drives a third Death Eater away before continuing his descent. Neville dashes off, and amidst the chaos, Ginny and Harry share a passionate kiss before Ginny rushes upstairs.\n\nDraco Malfoy rounds up his two cronies, Blaise and Goyle, forcing them away. Harry navigates a corridor where the roof is caving in, dodging the falling debris until he abruptly stops at a black stone wall—the entrance to the Room of Requirement. He focuses intently, and Ron, studying the Marauder's Map, looks up wide-eyed as he spots something ahead. Draco sees the entrance to the Room of Requirement and turns to his cronies, but as they rush towards the door, it vanishes, becoming a blank wall again.\n\nInside, Harry discovers a vast storeroom filled with towering stacks of furniture and junk. He proceeds deeper into the room, weaving through aisles packed with books, statues, and ornaments of gold and silver. A winged blue Pixie perched on a gold picture frame watches him curiously, fluttering lower for a better look. Harry pauses, listening intently, and turns to gaze back along his path. Drawn to a table laden with assorted items, he moves aside a coil of silk rope and uncovers a plain wooden casket. Opening it, he finds the diadem—a silver tiara shaped like a raven, adorned with a large blue stone and a teardrop-shaped stone hanging from it.\n\nBlaise and Goyle exchange a glance, and their spells collide, sending the diadem flying into the air.",
    "1279": "In the gripping opening, panic surges as a mysterious cloud flows into the operations room of a secure facility. Outside, a formidable assembly of military vehicles and personnel gather, but their efforts seem futile as an immense pressure builds against the facility's massive steel doors. The doors burst open, sending one person flying. Soldiers unleash their full firepower against the cloud, but it descends relentlessly down the hillside, causing men to flee as it reaches them. The Defense Secretary watches in resignation as the cloud advances.\n\nMeanwhile, a truck rumbles down a desert highway toward an industrial complex, the driver fiddling with the radio before switching on his windscreen wipers. Suddenly, the cloud envelops the truck, consuming it from the back until it disintegrates into dust. A road sign nearby also crumbles to nothing.\n\nIn a quiet, sparsely furnished room, Helen sits with her head bowed. She looks affectionately at Mike before gathering her belongings, including her phone, and checking her watch. Elsewhere, deep in the woods near a high bridge, Jacob and Klaatu discover an old ranger hut. They force open the door, and Jacob tries the phone. Klaatu, displaying a mysterious skill, unplugs the receiver, touches the end of the cord, and plugs it back in, allowing Jacob to dial successfully.\n\nA pickup truck drives down a forest road with Jacob and Klaatu sitting in the open back. Jacob looks earnestly at Klaatu, who initially considers him without emotion but then studies him thoughtfully. They arrive at an ornate, iron-gated cemetery filled with rows of white headstones. Jacob climbs over a low wall topped with iron railings, followed by Klaatu. Inside, Jacob brushes leaves away from one of the graves, revealing a headstone. He looks pleadingly at Klaatu, who studies the inscriptions and walks away, leaving Jacob kneeling dejectedly.\n\nHelen rushes to Jacob, embracing him tightly as he cries at his father's grave. Klaatu watches them intently, remaining expressionless as he approaches through the blowing leaves. Mike arrives in his SUV, and Helen looks at him imploringly, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nBehind Klaatu, a menacing swarm darkens the sky. The swarm, now a vast swirling gray sea, heads toward New York, leaving a sports stadium crumbled to dust in its wake. The Defense Secretary raises a hand to her mouth, stifling her emotion as the cloud's destruction becomes evident.",
    "1280": "A cinematic vista unfolds as a mysterious mass sprawls across the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, setting the stage for an unsettling narrative. New York City stands eerily deserted, its vibrant lights and iconic advertisements in Times Square left unseen. Amidst this desolation, Mike's SUV navigates the empty streets, carrying a tense group: Mike at the wheel, Klaatu in the passenger seat, and Helen and Jacob exchanging anxious glances in the back. Mike, after a quick glance at Klaatu, accelerates towards a military roadblock, causing soldiers to dive out of the way. They are pursued by armed Hummers, but their relentless chase soon falls back. The SUV veers into the leafy sanctuary of Central Park, racing across the grass towards an enigmatic sphere.\n\nSuddenly, an explosion catapults the car into a series of rolls before it comes to a halt against a tree. Overhead, fighter jets streak past as the sphere is engulfed in a colossal fireball, watched intently by Regina on a monitor, her eyes closing in relief as the smoke clears to reveal the sphere unscathed. Meanwhile, the swarm reaches Manhattan's edge, and in the wrecked car, Mike lies lifeless. Helen, frantic, unbuckles her seatbelt and notices the windscreen dissolving before her eyes. Klaatu, calm and composed, extracts himself from the vehicle and lifts Jacob out, followed by Helen, who witnesses the swarm enveloping the sphere as more dark clouds of insects swirl overhead, shrouding the sky.\n\nKlaatu leads Helen and Jacob in a desperate sprint across the grass, darting into a tunnel just ahead of the encroaching swarm. Inside, the swarm remains at bay, but Jacob's nose begins to bleed, and he collapses into Helen's arms. As she crouches to examine him, she notices blood on her own nose. Klaatu takes their hands, his eyes closed in concentration, as bugs emerge from Helen and Jacob's skin, burrowing into Klaatu. Jacob awakens, and Klaatu, now understood to possess extraordinary abilities, steps out into the raging swarm. He walks through the chaotic cloud, his suit tearing and skin bloodied, until he reaches the sphere. With a final, monumental effort, he stands and touches the sphere, triggering a blaze of light that absorbs him. The sphere pulses with energy, and the swarms of insects begin to fall like rain, signaling a dramatic shift in the unfolding saga.",
    "1282": "In a thunderous blast, an unseen force erupts, sending clouds of leaves swirling and bystanders tumbling. A child's buggy is sent spinning, and a park bench is torn from its foundations. Above, an Apache attack helicopter advances into the chaotic scene. Meanwhile, a helicopter carrying a team of scientists touches down in the park. Soldiers emerge, weapons at the ready, torches blazing, followed by scientists in hazmat suits, their glass-fronted helmets securely in place. The group cautiously navigates through the trees, approaching a glowing, vapor-shrouded object. their rifle-mounted torches pierce the thick gloom. Among them, Helen advances, her gaze fixed on the eerie green glow emanating from the object.\n\nSuddenly, lights dance in the fog, and a colossal, pulsating sphere becomes visible, towering hundreds of feet high. Helen, along with the gathered crowd, stares in awe, her mouth agape behind her visor. An intense beam of white light sweeps across the ground as military reinforcements arrive in Hummers, heavy machine guns at the ready. Police vehicles form a convoy, and soldiers disperse to firing positions. A soldier readies his .50 caliber heavy machine gun, aiming it at the sphere. Floodlights illuminate the site, and police snipers take up overwatch positions. The Apache helicopter circles the sphere, its lights concentrating at the base of the towering object, the intensity forcing Helen to shield her eyes.\n\nTension mounts as a figure emerges from the white blaze of light. Helen moves toward the hazy silhouette, her steps slow but determined. Soldiers prepare to fire, but Helen continues her approach. She hesitates as the figure extends a human-like hand. As she reaches out to take it, red blood sprays onto her visor, and the figure collapses into her arms. She gazes down at the humanoid shape with a featureless face, and personnel rush to assist.\n\nAbruptly, more lights blaze within the sphere, drawing everyone's gaze upward. A gigantic humanoid robot, standing some 50 feet high, emerges from the sphere, a bright light shining from an eye slit in its head. Every weapon is rendered inoperable, and all lights extinguish. People cry out in pain, overwhelmed by a powerful, debilitating noise emitted by the robot. It strides toward Helen, who still cradles the wounded visitor, and looms over her, its head dipping down, a vast hand outstretched. Then, it withdraws its hand, raises its head, and stands motionless, arms by its sides. The light in its eye slit fades, and abruptly, all lights, power, and weapons systems are restored, leaving the crowd in stunned silence.",
    "1284": "In a tense sequence, Helen and her escort stride past two agents pushing an empty wheelchair towards Klaatu's room. As lift doors glide open, Klaatu is revealed, confined to a wheelchair and surrounded by four agents. With his wrists manacled to the chair, he is pushed down a narrow passageway lined with pipes and then into a large room where a bespectacled man sits at a table filled with electronic equipment. Klaatu is positioned at the table, and electrodes are attached to his body and temples. The operator initiates a polygraph test, and the agents exit, joining others standing guard along the corridor.\n\nThe polygraph operator meticulously studies his equipment, his eyes fixed on the flickering electronic traces on his screen. Klaatu turns to observe the man, who stares back through glasses perched precariously on his nose. Suddenly, the screen blurs and distorts, while needles trace erratic wave patterns on scrolling graph paper. Klaatu's steady gaze meets the interrogator's bewildered frown just before the man is thrown backward by a sudden charge, twitching and sliding back upright with a blank stare.\n\nWith his eyes closed, Klaatu focuses his vision down the electrode cables, channeling through to security cameras overlooking the guards. Two more suited agents walking along the corridor abruptly clamp their hands over their earpieces and collapse in agony. The building's power fluctuates, causing the lights to flicker. Helen, startled, grabs her coat and a sample of Klaatu's outer skin, while Klaatu, now standing and dressed in a suit, removes the electrodes from the catatonic polygraph operator, who slumps onto the table.\n\nKlaatu strides confidently down the corridor, past the agents still writhing in pain. Meanwhile, Helen dashes through a dimly lit corridor, her path illuminated by the flickering lights. Klaatu enters the lift and emerges to walk down a railway line in an industrial area, with flames flaring from a nearby refinery stack. Arriving at a railway station platform, he walks in slow motion alongside a train and into the bustling concourse, calmly navigating through the crowds. He glances up at the departures board, noting that all trains are delayed. Amidst the chaos, a bearded man jostles through the crowd, deftly snatching a ticket from a passerby's pocket.",
    "1286": "In the opening scene, a car sits idle, windscreen wipers and headlights still on. A man exits and approaches a taxi from which an elderly Chinese man emerges, accompanied by a young man holding an umbrella. Inside a restaurant, the young man serves the older man a cup of tea as he sits across from Klaatu. Nearby, Helen and her grandson sit at another table, Helen stealing glances at Klaatu and the old man, her eyes eventually drifting downwards. Klaatu gazes at the old man, his expression inscrutable.\n\nMeanwhile, high metal panels are erected, forming a triangular barrier around a robot, capped by a lid. A Colonel watches nervously as police cars race down a night-shrouded street. Helen drives towards the Highlands, New Jersey, where Klaatu exits the car in a wooded area, leaving Jacob bewildered and staring out the window. Helen follows Klaatu into the pitch-black night, moving slowly and cowering as insects swarm around her.\n\nShe reaches a pond where the water's surface bubbles and emits light from below. Hiding, she witnesses a luminous sphere, about 10 feet high, rise from the pond, drawing local wildlife. The sphere drifts to the pond's edge, where Klaatu approaches and touches it, causing a flare of light.\n\nSimilar spheres manifest worldwide: one in Central Park circled by choppers, another in a desert attracting scorpions and snakes, and a vast sphere surfacing behind a fishing boat. Helen watches Klaatu concentrate by the pond sphere, then returns to her car, stunned. Global footage shows crowds around a sphere in South America and another being blasted with a flamethrower, revealing creatures squirming inside.\n\nBack in the woods, Helen and Jacob wait in the car. She follows the boy into the darkness, and they are bathed in brilliant light as the pond sphere ascends, blazing with white light, leaving them staring in awe.",
    "1288": "As dawn breaks, three helicopters cut through the morning sky, their lights flickering ominously. Startled, Helen dashes indoors, stealing a moment to kiss a man on the cheek before hastily retreating. Alongside Klaatu and Jacob, she swiftly departs from the house, sprinting through the pouring rain to their car. Abandoning the vehicle, they flee into the thick surrounding woods, Klaatu taking the lead while Helen struggles to keep pace, clutching Jacob's hand. The roar of choppers overhead pushes them to accelerate through the dense forest, but Jacob suddenly pulls away from Helen's grasp. In a swift, jarring moment, a soldier descends from a helicopter and seizes Helen.\n\nKlaatu, undeterred, steps into a clearing, drawing the helicopters' targeting lasers to his palms. With a burst of energy, he reverses the lasers' flow, sending the pilots into agonized convulsions as their aircraft spin out of control. The choppers collide and plummet, exploding in a massive fireball. Jacob, witnessing this, flees back into the woods with Klaatu calmly pursuing him.\n\nThe boy reaches a narrow, rickety bridge over a river, tentatively stepping onto the slippery planks. As Klaatu approaches, a board breaks under Jacob's feet, but Klaatu swiftly grasps him, preventing a fall. The two share a prolonged, tense stare before Klaatu walks away, with Jacob hesitantly following after a moment.\n\nMeanwhile, an operative in protective gear enters GORT's chamber to repair a drill mechanism, observed by an agent and ops room staff through a window. The damaged drill bit is replaced, but tiny, multiplying black bugs lurk within its minute cracks. As the operative finishes, he notices the old drill bit dissolving, along with his suit, air canister, and even his body. The steel bands restraining GORT are also disintegrating. Panic surges as the observation window is attacked, and a colossal jet of flame engulfs the chamber. When the smoke clears, GORT remains, eyes aglow. The agent watches in horror as GORT raises his now-free hands, transforming into a swarm of bugs that fills the chamber. The agent tries to escape, but his pass fails, and the swirling cloud assaults the windows, signaling a grim turn of events.",

The house stands out starkly with its bare, unlandscaped yard. Inside the car, Mac and Juno sit, their faces a picture of mortification as they await a greeting. Vanessa, a attractive and fastidious woman in her early thirties, opens the door and ushers them inside, her movements slightly awkward. She takes Juno's hooded sweatshirt and places it on a bench.\n\nMark Loring, a boyishly handsome man in his mid-thirties, joins Vanessa. With a sheepish glance at Vanessa upon hearing a mention of the Penny Saver, he extends his hand to Mac and Juno. Mac enthusiastically shakes Mark's hand. The couple then leads the visitors into their vast, stark living room, where a woman in a business suit sits on the couch, a briefcase resting in her lap. Vanessa is visibly thrilled, while Juno and Mark lock eyes. Juno holds her wrist up to Mark's twitching nostrils, and he inhales. Juno's attention is drawn to a slightly ajar door, revealing a room adorned with guitars mounted on the wall and edges of posters.\n\nMeanwhile, Vanessa, Mac, and Gerta Rauss wait in uncomfortable silence. Mac notices a brand-new pilates machine, still in its packaging, tucked away in the corner. Vanessa and Gerta remain silent, Vanessa's gaze drifting to the ceiling. In the other room, Mark and Juno strum unplugged guitars, playing small riffs, Mark appearing embarrassed by Vanessa's overzealous behavior.\n\nAs Juno and Mac prepare to leave, donning their coats, Vanessa and Mark follow behind. Mac casts a grave look at Juno, who turns to look at Mark one last time before they exit. Mark closes the door behind them.\n\nElsewhere, a track team jogs in formation, their feet leaving imprints in the snow. Bleeker runs solo on the track, soon joined by his friend Vijay, a solemn, lanky boy much like himself. The duo never stops running, even as Vijay eventually jogs off, leaving Bleeker to wipe away his sweat and pause.\n\nThe scene shifts to Juno, now five months pregnant, looking down at her belly as a school administrator fills out a slip. She takes it, turns around, and smiles all the way out of the office, only to bump into Bleeker. Later, during an ultrasound appointment, Juno, Leah, and Bren become defensive at the sight of the baby's head on the monitor. The ultrasound tech leaves in a huff, while Juno lies in bed later, examining the ultrasound printout.\n\nFinally, the Previa drives back into the gated community of Mark and Vanessa. Juno, shifting her weight in the cold, rings the doorbell. Mark answers, casually dressed in a t-shirt and jeans.",
    "1299": "In the dimly lit family room, Graham smiles as he and Merrill turn their attention back to the muted television screen. Merrill's mouth hangs open slightly, both of them fixated on the TV. Suddenly, Graham's eyes flutter open as daylight floods the room. He finds himself alone on the couch, the television nowhere to be seen. Standing up, he scans the area, his gaze landing on an extension cord snaking from a wall outlet, across the hall, and disappearing under a closet door. Intrigued, Graham approaches and opens the closet to find Merrill seated on a kitchen chair, the television perched on a roll-away stand beside him. The screen displays a daylight scene of Mexico City under empty skies. Merrill traces a path with his finger from the top of the screen downwards.\n\nLater, Graham emerges from the bathroom, his hair wet from a recent shower. He dries it with a towel as he moves to his bedroom window, observing the expansive backyard. A lush green lawn stretches out, featuring a wooden jungle gym and a solitary tree casting shade onto a picnic table. The yard is bordered by towering corn crops, golden and brown, extending far beyond sight. Graham watches and listens intently.\n\nMoving into the hallway, he peeks into another room where his children, Morgan and Bo, sit on the edge of their bed, tin foil wrapped around their heads like makeshift helmets. Graham enters, and the children make space for him on the bed. Morgan places a book on his father's lap. Graham examines the back cover for an author photo, but Morgan closes the book, prompting Graham to look at his children, curious. Morgan reopens the book, and Graham nods, acknowledging its presence. Turning the page, they see an illustration of a small, bulbous-headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan flips to another page, revealing a spaceship hovering over a home, blasting it with laser beams. The following image shows three lifeless bodies—two of them children—lying on the front lawn. The children scream and cling to their father, their cries eventually subsiding. Graham closes the book as the phone rings once more.\n\nStepping out into the hallway, Graham tucks the book under his arm and answers the phone. Through the receiver, he hears sudden scuffling and the sharp squeal of a chair against the floor before the call abruptly disconnects.",
    "1300": "Graham descends the stairs, dressed in his overcoat, and approaches the closet door, knocking before opening it. He proceeds down the hall, unaware that Merrill is stepping out of the closet for the first time. Meanwhile, Morgan abruptly stops his telescope observation as Bo embraces him tightly. Morgan gently removes Bo's arms from around him. Graham, at the front door, unlocks it and turns to the hall, frozen in shock at something he sees. He remains motionless, staring intensely.\n\nRay, elsewhere, grips the steering wheel so tightly that his knuckles turn a pale yellow-white. Beside him, two large bags overflow with clothes. Graham, glancing into the backseat of the truck, notices this and then his gaze shifts back to Ray, drawn to two bloodstained areas on his shirt. Tears begin to stream down Graham's face. Ray finally turns to face him, his red, quivering face struggling to speak. They lock eyes briefly before Ray looks away, puts the car in drive, and pulls down the driveway, leaving Graham to step back as the truck moves forward.\n\nBack inside, Merrill leans against a pile of winter coats, his eyes closed. He awakens, sitting up in his chair, which creaks as he leans slightly forward towards the television screen, displaying the word \"RUNNING.\" Graham, elsewhere, waits for a response that never comes. He bends down, attempting to peer under a door, but his angle is too severe, and he can only see the bottoms of a few shelves in the pantry. He sits up, just a few feet from the pantry door, looking around in indecision.\n\nHis eyes fall on a scattering of kitchen knives on the floor. Picking up a butcher knife, he moves closer to the door and uses the knife as a makeshift mirror to see under it. He watches the soft reflection but then pulls the knife out, kneeling near the door. Graham takes a deep breath, starting to lower his head under the slanted table, but stops midway, losing his nerve. He rises, placing the butcher knife on the counter, and walks across the kitchen to the door, where he pauses for a long time. Finally, he lets go of the doorknob, turns, and quickly retraces his steps, picking up the butcher knife again. He kneels by the pantry, ducks his head under the table, and places his cheek to the floor, mere inches from the door's bottom, to look into the pantry.",
    "1302": "In the dimly lit hallway, Graham gently sets Bo down, with the four of them huddling closely together in tense silence. Morgan gazes at his father, words failing him, as the group's attention is drawn upward in unison. Merrill's gaze sweeps up the stairs, fixating on the boarded bedroom doors before shifting to a peculiar rectangle in the ceiling, from which a tiny rope dangles. Meanwhile, Morgan and Bo are paralyzed with fear, watching as eerie, elongated fingers probe under the front door, their color shifting to mimic the yellowed, cracked paint.\n\nGraham and Merrill quickly join the children in the front hall. Graham swiftly leads Morgan and Bo down the hallway, while Merrill keeps a vigilant eye on the staircase. Graham descends the final steps into the basement, pulling the door shut behind him, though it offers no lock for security. The basement is a cluttered array of metal shelves, overflowing with canned goods, tools, and other miscellaneous items. Merrill desperately searches through the disorganized shelves, scattering items in his haste.\n\nAs Graham presses his ear to the door, listening intently, an ominous scratching sound echoes from the other side. The doorknob begins to turn, and Graham grasps it tightly, trying to hold the door closed as it starts to push open. Above them, a solitary light bulb casts a weak glow, the room's only source of light. Merrill, finding a pickaxe hidden behind a stack of shelves, holds it aloft and rushes towards Graham. In his haste, he strikes the light bulb with the handle, extinguishing their only light source.\n\nIn the ensuing darkness, Merrill fumbles with a radio, switching between stations and hearing only static. Graham steps into the faint beams of the children's flashlights, his gaze darting between the door and Merrill's shadowy corner. Morgan directs his beam towards Merrill, then places the flashlight on the ground, rolling it to Graham. As Graham picks up the flashlight, Merrill regains his composure, retrieving the remaining flashlight and training its beam on his nephew, whose complexion appears ghostly gray. Pulling Morgan close, Graham whispers reassurances into the child's ear as they brace for whatever lies beyond the door.",
    "1303": "In the grips of a severe reaction, Morgan's throat begins to close, his face a picture of panic and distress. His brother, Merrill, watches him with growing concern, while Graham, closing his eyes, murmurs into the darkness. Merrill's eyes well up with tears as Graham's eyes flutter closed and then open, leaning in to whisper to Morgan. Overcome with emotion, Graham begins to cry, speaking to no one in particular, then nods resolutely.\n\nSuddenly, a beam of light points up at the basement ceiling. Graham, noticing the conviction in Merrill's expression, turns to see Morgan lying motionless on the floor. The two brothers stand under the dim glow of a single light bulb, Graham's focus shifting back to Morgan. He moves swiftly across the room, kneeling to unclip the baby monitor from Morgan's belt. After turning it on, filling the room with electrical static. Graham returns to Merrill, holding the monitor out between them.\n\nMeanwhile, the basement door creaks open slightly. Merrill pushes it wide and ventures upstairs alone. Reaching the top, he scans the area before turning back to give a thumbs up to the faces waiting below. Moments later, Graham carefully carries Morgan's limp body to the sofa, while Bo, stepping out of the closet, surveys the family room. Graham's attention flickers between Morgan and something else, his gaze finally fixing on a point Merrill notices too—a baseball bat mounted on the wall.\n\nAs Merrill takes the bat, a creature begins to stir, its form distorting the room around it. Merrill's grip tightens as he advances, then stops, shifting his weight. Morgan's face is now obscured by a mysterious gas. With a powerful swing, Merrill hammers the creature across the back, causing it to drop Morgan, who crumples to the floor, limbs splayed. The creature rights itself, only to be felled again by Merrill's relentless blows.\n\nGraham rushes to gather his son's lifeless body in his arms, even as the creature begins to rise once more. The tense and emotive sequence of events underscores the brothers' desperate battle against an unknown and terrifying force.",
    "1305": "In the hushed stillness, a side door creaks open, revealing David Dunne, a hooded figure, who slips into a cramped laundry room. A mountain of unopened mail, accumulated over two or three days, litters the clothes dryer. David's gaze, hidden beneath his hood, takes in the disarray: cabinets yawn open, and a breakfast table sits untouched, bearing a plate of moldering eggs and two bowls of colorful cereal.\n\nDavid edges towards a kitchen door, slightly ajar, his face shielded from the overpowering smell. He quietly pulls the door open, revealing a staircase leading down to the basement. At the bottom lies the lifeless body of a man, his tie crumpled on his motionless chest, half-shadowed in the dim light.\n\nDavid enters the room, his movements tense and deliberate. He follows the sound of a scuffle upstairs, moving towards the stairs as someone is knocked out. Three closed doors meet on a landing. David opens the nearest one, revealing a young girl's room, strewn with clothes and adorned with boy band posters, but empty.\n\nIn the adjoining bathroom, a stark scene unfolds. A slightly overweight fourteen-year-old girl and her younger, skinny brother are tied to a metal towel rack, their wrists bound with a phone cord, knees drawn to their chests. Their heads loll back against their arms, eyes barely open, listless. They watch as David, his dark rain poncho still dripping, steps into the bathroom. He pauses before approaching them, their arms falling to their laps as they gaze up at him. The boy blinks slowly. David steps back, staring at them from under his hood.\n\nLater, David finds himself in a store, his attention drawn to a framed sketch. He turns to see a striking African American woman in her sixties standing next to him. She meets his gaze for the first time. Across the room, Elijah engages with customers, drawing both David and the woman's attention. They watch as Elijah's mother approaches, waiting for her son to finish his conversation. David's gaze shifts back to the sketch, his thoughts a mystery amidst the bustling store.",
    "1304": "In a bustling shopping area, **Dr. Mathison** sets down his shopping bags and approaches a woman, kneeling before her. With a gentle gesture, he offers to take the bundle of sweatshirts she's holding, evoking a smile from her for the first time. She hands him a wrapped child, whom Mathison carefully lowers onto his lap, beginning to unwrap the baby. The woman, now unable to see her child, watches the doctor intently as he examines the baby. When he finally looks up, Mathison's expression is troubled, and he meets the woman's gaze for only a brief moment—long enough for a chill to run through her.\n\nThe doctor's gaze shifts to the three saleswomen in the room, his hard stare causing them to feel unsettled. The older saleswoman speaks up, and instantly, everyone in the room becomes very still. The mother seems to stop breathing, and the tense silence is abruptly broken when the baby screams. Mathison whispers something inaudible to himself before turning his attention back to the mother.\n\nLater, on a train, **David** notices a woman, **Kelly**, reading a Sports Illustrated magazine. When she looks up, her striking blue eyes meet his. She holds up her hand, tapping the diamond ring on her finger, and an awkward silence ensues. Kelly rises, steadying herself against a headrest as the train rumbles, and makes her way to the back of the car, leaving David alone. He seems overwhelmed, as if drowning in his emotions. Feeling a stare, he glances up to see a little girl peeking at him from between the seats. David leans towards the window, avoiding eye contact, and slides his wedding band back onto his finger.\n\nThe vibration of the train begins to lull him, his head lightly bouncing against the window, but the shaking keeps his eyes from closing completely. David jolts awake as the train's speed increases, the scenery outside blurring. Other passengers start to react, the normal bumps of the tracks becoming amplified as the train gains speed. He notices the little girl is no longer watching him and looks to the passengers across from him. Behind them, through the windows, the ground slowly drops away.\n\nMeanwhile, in a quiet home, a *ten-year-old boy* sits on his head on the family couch, his floppy brown hair spread out in a circle as he watches television upside down, his face reddened.",
    "1306": "Joseph Dunne, sprawled on his couch, aimlessly surfed through channels with his remote, breezing past upside-down cartoons and talk shows. Abruptly, an upside-down image of a train wreck seized his attention. With a surge of urgency, he kicked his legs over the edge of the couch, tumbling onto the carpet as if drawn magnetically towards the television. He stood, eyes locked on the screen displaying a live aerial view of a smoldering train wreck—a grim dance of mangled metal, where two trains lay entwined like serpents.\n\nCompelled by the grim scene, Joseph rushed to a small table holding a telephone and a notepad, his movements swift and purposeful. The surroundings snapped into focus, revealing a physical therapy center humming with activity. About a dozen patients diligently worked on specialized weight machines, while an elderly woman sat on an exercise table, her breaths deep and measured. Nearby, a secretary—her age etched deeply into her features—wielded a pen over a blank pad with mechanical precision, her left hand never pausing its typing, her gaze forever lowered.\n\nMeanwhile, at a rain-drenched stadium, David stood sentinel at the mouth of a tunnel, his form obscured by a voluminous dark green rain poncho. The poncho, its once-bold 'SECURITY' label now faded, draped him from head to toe, his face a mere suggestion beneath the hood. On the expansive field, a football game raged on, players reduced to tiny, distant figures. Unfazed by the deluge, David ventured forth, his form eventually pivoting on a bench, the world around him momentarily stilled.\n\nBack in the therapy center, Audrey flicked her gaze away, attempting to cloak her reaction to an unusual query that hung in the air. Elijah, seated rigidly, stared at the blank television screen, his features a tapestry of tension and resolve. His mother's whisper sliced through the silence, drawing Elijah's gaze, and a wordless exchange passed between them, pregnant with emotion. Elijah, grappling with an internal storm, regarded his mother with incredulity before retreating into thought.\n\nLater, Elijah traversed a bustling playground, his cautious steps weaving among the carefree children. Approaching a bench bearing a gift, he sat, the package resting lightly on his lap. With meticulous care, he untied the white bow and peeled away the tape and paper, revealing a lone comic book. The shadow of his mother eclipsed him as she took her place beside him. Elijah's piercing gaze briefly met hers before returning to his lap, where the comic lay open to a vivid battle scene atop a building, one figure masked and powerfully built.",
    "1307": "In the dimly lit art gallery, a stark contrast of subjects adorns the walls—half human, half animal hybrids starkly depicted in comic book illustrations. Elijah, a man with a noticeable walking stick, steals a glance at the businessman next to him before returning his gaze to a particular sketch. The businessman, seemingly weary, rubs his face and also looks at the sketch. Elijah abruptly moves to the back of the gallery, his walking stick sinking into the thick carpet as he stops and turns back to the businessman, shaking his head vigorously. His eyes fix on the man with an intense stare, and he points at the sketch before turning to face the other customers for the first time.\n\nAcross the room, David Dunne stands with a young boy named Joseph. Elijah's gaze lingers on them for a long moment before he approaches. When he finally speaks, his voice is barely above a whisper. David nods in response, but Elijah appears shaken, his eyes never leaving David. He gestures toward the framed comic sketches, but David merely shakes his head, offering a frustrated smile. Elijah watches as David walks away, joining Joseph at the front door. Through the window, Elijah observes Joseph take David's hand as they cross the street, leaving him in a state of quiet bewilderment.\n\nLater that night, David sits upright in bed, clutching a torn piece of newspaper. Joseph sleeps soundly beside him, his legs draped over David’s. Carefully, David extricates himself and moves to the dark corner of the room. He opens a narrow closet door, pulling a chain to illuminate a naked hanging bulb. David steps inside, ensuring the light doesn't fall on Joseph. The cramped space barely allows him room to stand and search the top shelf. His hand retrieves an object wrapped in a t-shirt—a handgun. He stares at it momentarily before wrapping it back up and returning it to its place.\n\nStretching further, David reaches for a folder stuffed with clippings. Opening it reveals a young David in a football uniform, triumphantly holding his helmet. He flips through the clippings, all chronicling his football glory days. Turning the pile over, he finds the last clipping, folded over three times, unlike the others. It's a newspaper headline. Placing the new headline next to an older one, David notes their eerie similarity—even the font is matched. His gaze fixates on the old headline, particularly on the disturbing image of a heavily damaged car lying upside down on the highway.",
    "1310": "In the quiet of a home gym, a father and son share a poignant moment. Joseph reaches out, taking his father David's hand, while David gazes down at his son, who stands patiently. David's attention shifts to a barbell nearby, his eyes scanning the black metal weights, counting them silently. He turns back to Joseph, then looks at the weights again, as if assessing a challenge. Joseph steps towards the barbell, his breath growing labored as he engages with the weights.\n\nMeanwhile, David prepares for his own test of strength. He reclines, grips the bar, and lifts it off its rest. His arms tremble under the strain as he completes two arduous repetitions before the weights clatter back onto the support. David sits up, his focus entirely on the barbell. He counts the black discs meticulously, his gaze fixed on the cold metal. Both father and son stare at the weight, a silent understanding passing between them.\n\nJoseph retreats to the base of the stairs, waiting as David steels himself for another set. With a deep breath, David heaves the weight off its rest, his muscles quivering with the effort. His eyes meet Joseph's wide gaze, reflecting a mix of fear and pride. The barbell is adorned with an extraordinary number of black discs, and on either side, two unopened cans of MAB satin finish paint dangle, swaying with each lift. David's face contorts with exertion as he manages two more lifts, his arms shaking violently before he drops the barbell onto its rest.\n\nExhausted, David sits up and turns to the weights, his lips moving silently as he recalculates the total. His eyes glaze over, lost in thought, barely registering Elijah's subtle nod from across the room. The physician's words trail off, leaving Elijah staring blankly into space, his mind elsewhere.\n\nThe scene shifts to a physical therapy center. Audrey, dedicated to her work, guides an elderly gentleman through his paces on a stationary bike. A co-worker steps in, allowing Audrey to leave her post. She crosses the room, her smile warm and genuine as she approaches Elijah, his leg encased in a metal brace, held rigidly in place.",
    "1311": "In the opening scene, a glimpse of bandages wrapped around his ribs is visible beneath his shirt. Audrey, caught off guard by a question, fixes her gaze on Elijah. He responds with a warm smile, which she softly returns. Elijah's smile broadens, and Audrey's eyes become intensely still.\n\nThe scene shifts to David standing at the entrance of a tunnel leading to the upper section of the second level in a bustling stadium. Crowds surge past him, moving to and from their seats to the bathrooms and concession stands. David leans against the wall, staring absentmindedly to the side. Suddenly, he steps into the flow of people, jostled by shoulders and arms brushing past him. His gaze is downcast, his expression still, as if he is intently listening. Amidst the heaviest crowd movement, a stocky woman bumps into him, jolting him from his thoughts.\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph turns to a boy holding a thermometer. David nods, his attention shifting to a white-haired nurse and then to a woman nearby. Lost in thought, David eventually looks up at the nurse. Joseph finally lifts his gaze, tears welling in his eyes. David moves closer to Joseph on the bench, but Joseph merely stares at his father.\n\nIn a stark turning point, David is rinsing a bowl when Audrey enters the room. He turns off the water, and Audrey notices his shocked expression. She turns around and screams in horror. Joseph is crying hard, holding out a handgun from David's closet, aimed directly at David. Panic surges as David shoots a tense glance at Audrey and cautiously shifts to his right. Joseph tracks him with the gun barrel. They both freeze, Joseph's face a mix of confusion and desperation, tears streaming down his cheeks. He begins to press the trigger, the hammer clicking back, but then freezes. David's glance darts desperately between Audrey and Joseph, his words finally registering. He looks suddenly unsteady.\n\nThe intensity of the scene is briefly interrupted as Elijah appears shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly. The focus then shifts to a man with a ponytail closing his register and walking towards the back. As he approaches a customer, he realizes the man is in a wheelchair. The ponytail man leans over, shaking his head, and moves behind Elijah to wheel him towards the front of the store. They navigate down a narrow aisle of comics. Suddenly, Elijah grabs the left wheel, turning the chair sharply. His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books, scattering them across the floor.",
    "1312": "In a quiet comic book store, a handful of comics scatters across the floor. A man with a ponytail uprights a wheelchair and begins pushing it down the aisle, only for the passenger, Elijah, to abruptly seize the wheel, sending the chair crashing into the opposite wall. Comics cascade onto the wheelchair and surrounding floor. As the duo proceeds down the aisle, the silence is abruptly broken by Elijah jerking the wheelchair to the left, his metal brace colliding with two racks, and sending more comics tumbling onto him. The ponytail man leaves Elijah, who sits transfixed and hunched over, staring at a comic in his lap. For the first time, Elijah's expression shifts. The man dials a number from the front counter, glancing at Elijah while awaiting a response. Elijah lifts a single comic high into the air.\n\nMeanwhile, at a fashionable restaurant, David and Audrey nurse their drinks, deep in thought, at one end of the bar. Audrey leans in, causing David's grin to dissolve. Mere inches apart, David steals a glance at Audrey, noticing her tense expression and eyes welling with tears. He holds her gaze, searching her eyes. On their second date, the married couple huddles closely together. As they prepare to leave, the babysitter, a young woman with black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses, waits in the doorway. Audrey's smile flickers and fades, prompting the babysitter to adjust her glasses, sensing the sudden shift in mood. David pays her, and she dashes out into the rain, covering her head with her jacket.\n\nBack home, Audrey retreats to the guest bedroom, leaving David alone in the dimly lit kitchen. The truck driver, slipping and sliding, approaches David, who looks back and forth between the driver and Audrey, shivering in the grass.\n\nIn the grandeur of a vast train station, Elijah closes his eyes, drawing strength from within. The station's interior is an awe-inspiring sight—an enormous, cavernous room stretching the size of a football field, flanked by giant pillars that ascend into a misty, hand-painted ceiling. David, standing in a quiet corner, observes the faces of passengers coming and going from late-night trains, his mind filled with the silent echoes of the day's events.",
    "1314": "Santa abruptly pushes a child off his lap, sending him on his way. An Elf, peeling off a fake pointed ear, nods in acknowledgment. Meanwhile, Santa retrieves a hidden bottle of Old Grandad whiskey from his throne's cushions and takes a quick swig. As the night wears on, the store's lights begin to shut down department by department, signaling the end of the day. Downstairs, the last employees exit, acknowledged by an elderly security guard who eventually is joined by Santa himself. The guard activates the security system and leaves, locking the door behind him.\n\nSuddenly, a once-stationary teddy bear bolts upright and darts from the room. The alarm system counts down to 15 seconds, as the bear slides down the escalator railing. In a frantic rush, it crashes through the store, even tearing the arm off a mannequin. Skidding to a halt at the alarm box, the bear reveals its true identity: Marcus Skidmore, an elf in disguise, panting heavily. He opens a door revealing Willie T. Soke, a off-duty, beer-drinking Santa. Willie crushes his empty beer can, adding it to a pile of others. Marcus, with a sneer, moves past him and starts gathering specific items from jewelry cases, placing them in a cart. Methodically, he collects an assortment of goods, from furs to gowns to shoes, checking each against a typed list.\n\nMarcus finds Willie using a water drill on the store's vault. As the drill retracts, Willie uses a screwdriver and sledgehammer to breach the lock, swinging the door open to reveal stacks of cash. Both are visibly impressed by their haul. Later, Willie settles in the back of a van while Marcus takes the passenger seat next to Lois, Willie's longtime mail-order wife, who is dressed in tacky expensive clothes with a perpetually displeased expression. The van speeds off into the Christmas Eve night, disappearing like thistledown.\n\nThe next morning, an alarm clock jolts Willie awake, bleary-eyed in his bed.",
    "1315": "In the throes of morning lethargy, Willie fumbles to silence his alarm, his sleep-ridden fingers failing him. His frustration mounts, culminating in a final scream that releases his tension. He finds himself holding a half-empty beer bottle, a cigarette butt floating inside. Draining the bottle, he steps into the bathroom to brush his teeth.\n\nLater, Willie's journey takes him to an upscale restaurant during lunch hour. In a swift, casual motion, he lifts a handful of car keys from the valet box and continues on. Entering the parking lot, he tests each key fob, his interest piquing when a brand new Cadillac responds. He slides into the driver's seat and departs.\n\nDriving, Willie retrieves the car registration from the glove compartment, his eyes settling on the owner's address. Time passes, and we see Willie in a lavish marble bathroom, seated, flipping through a magazine, a beer within reach. His pants are around his ankles, but he soon stands, securing his belt, and attempts to flush the toilet. The lever resists his efforts, so he grabs his beer and saunters off.\n\nBeer in hand, Willie circles the room, systematically dislodging paintings from the walls. His path of destruction leads him to the bedroom, where he reveals a hidden wall safe. With a smile, he produces a stethoscope. The safe yields, unveiling stacks of cash. Later, Willie is seen sporting a Rolex and a flashy ring, scratching a lottery ticket.\n\nIn the scorching heat, Willie and Marcus, dressed as Santa and his elf, traverse the vast Saguaro Square Mall parking lot. Willie finishes a pint of Smirnoff, tossing the emptystoward a trash can, and pops some Tic Tacs. As they enter the store, a burly man, Harrison, storms out, capturing their attention. Bob Chipeska watches alongside them. A beautiful girl in skin-tight pants walks by, commanding Willie's gaze. Marcus, noticing Willie's distraction, mimics laughter, then quickly regains composure.",
    "1316": "In the heart of a bustling holiday scene, several of Santa's elf mannequins, dressed in eclectic attire including cowboy wear and a poncho with a sombrero, tend to Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro. A line of eager children stretches out, awaiting their turn. Marcus, with a flair for the dramatic, navigates through the crowd, eliciting gasps and cheers from the young spectators. Playing to his audience, he reaches down, grabs a bottle from the floor, and takes a swig, all while maintaining a piercing stare. In a sudden burst of aggression, Marcus snatches a hat and forcefully thrusts it into Willie's chest, punctuating the action with a swift kick to Willie's rear as he rises.\n\nMeanwhile, on the fringes of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot, a city bus hisses to a stop. The doors swing open, revealing a pathetic eight-year-old kid, overweight, snot-nosed, poorly dressed, and likely smelling of urine. As the kid approaches the mall entrance, he passes a group of older children performing skateboard stunts, who take notice of him. Inside, Marcus is already in action, placing another young boy on his lap before moving towards the rope barrier. The snot-nosed kid, next in line, stands frozen with fear. Marcus's actions penetrate the kid's anxiety, prompting him to move forward. Marcus leads the kid to the throne and places him on Willie's lap. The kid stares motionlessly, a rivulet of snot flowing from his nose, capturing Willie's attention. Suddenly, the kid reaches out and yanks Willie's beard, holding it stretched below his chin. Willie reacts defensively, shoving the kid away. The kid backs off, his gaze never wavering, filled with awe and reverence.\n\nThe kid takes a seat on a bench, his eyes fixed on the entrance to Chamberlain's. After a moment, Willie and Marcus emerge in costume, crossing towards the parking lot. The kid follows at a safe distance as Willie and Marcus traverse the vast, empty lot. Creeping closer, the kid eavesdrops on their conversation. The scene shifts to a large, faux-rustic bar packed with middle-management types, their ties loosened after a long day. The kid's gaze scans the room, locking onto the drunken, glowering face of a Hindustani Troublemaker, startling Willie briefly. A bartender pours two drinks, which they quickly down. As she refills their glasses, Willie stares at her intently. The Troublemaker matches Willie's gaze for a moment before looking down, discovering the kid beating on his legs. This gives Willie a chance to regain his composure.\n\nLater, the kid sits in the front seat next to Willie, who drives with a mix of absentmindedness and focus, his eyes darting from side to side in search of road signs. Willie escorts the kid along a lengthy walkway leading to the front door of a grand, opulent Southwestern home. As they approach, Willie can't help but admire the lavish surroundings, taking in the rich, new-money aesthetic of the residence.",
    "1317": "In the quiet of a room, Grandma, clad in a bathrobe and thick glasses with another pair dangling from her neck, struggles to her feet using her walker. She begins her slow journey towards Willie, her steps echoing softly. Willie watches her, seeing not just an elderly woman, but a figure of innocence and frailty. Impatiently, he removes his mask and turns to his young accomplice, the Kid, who responds with a disapproving shake of his head.\n\nSuddenly, the room is filled with the sound of a tumbler clicking into place. Light floods in as the safe door swings open, revealing Willie, grinning, with his stethoscope in his ears. Inside lie stacks of cash and a folio. Willie reaches in, grabs the folio, and quickly flips through it. The silence is broken by the screech of a new Mercedes speeding away, leaving the Kid standing at the curb, waving goodbye.\n\nWillie and Marcus part ways, heading to their respective cars. Opal, watching Willie, barely conceals her disdain. Yet, she reluctantly inches closer to him. Later, Willie is seen at a pay phone, the Kid eagerly opening the door for him as he arrives, small bag in hand. The Kid trails Willie like a loyal puppy, watching as he inspects the house, pushing open doors and surveying each room.\n\nWillie finds the master bedroom, its appearance suggesting it hasn't been used in ages. He tosses his bag onto the dusty bed. Later, he is seen in the tub, motionless, a wet washcloth draped over his face. His fingers rest against a glass filled with ice and amber liquid perched on the tub's edge. Pulling the washcloth off his face, he looks at the Kid, who gazes back, unfazed.\n\nElsewhere, a figure passes by a room where a woman, mid-chew, glances up and jots something in her notebook. Willie, staring at a board, leaps up screaming and throws it across the room. The Kid, watching, remains calm and smiling. Later, the Kid sleeps peacefully in bed, while Willie, donning a Santa hat, is engaged in a passionate encounter with Sue in the Jacuzzi.\n\nWillie, bleary-eyed, drains the last of his bottle and delicately sets it down. Suddenly, he collapses, unconscious. He awakens to the sound of screaming. The Kid, terrified, crashes through his bedroom door and runs into Willie, only to bounce off and flee down the hall, his screams echoing. Turning the corner, Willie sees bloody palm prints smeared along the wall, the Kid's screaming figure disappearing at the far end.",
    "1319": "Gin kicks off the events by securing the cables. Meanwhile, lurking behind Jesse in the Men's Wear section, Lois wears a scowl of disapproval. Seizing the moment when Jesse isn't looking, she curiously shoves a table of sweaters a few feet away. The table emits a loud SQUEEEEEEEAK!, but the commotion on the floor drowns it out. Content with her actions, Lois exits through the door. Simultaneously, Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate, taking a deep inhale, which prompts a grimace from Marcus.\n\nJesse then makes his way to the alarm panel by the doorway, activating the ARM key. An LED readout labeled ARMING initiates a 30-second countdown. Marcus reaches the vent above the surveillance room, retrieves the remote control purchased by Lois, and points it into the room, shutting down the massive bank of VCRs. Continuing his mission, Marcus finds himself at the edge of a descending duct.\n\nBack at the safe, Willie is transfixed, his eyes locked onto it. He licks his lips in anticipation. Marcus, meanwhile, emerges from a stockroom pushing a cart, ready to embark on a shopping spree. Willie, now equipped with a stethoscope, taps the safe and listens attentively. Marcus begins his haul in Ladies' Accessories, snagging a cashmere scarf. Willie progresses to drilling the safe, then tries prying it open with a chisel, and even uses a plasma welder, all while Marcus struggles to retrieve a stole from a mannequin in Evening Wear, eventually resorting to hacking it down with a golf club.\n\nWillie's relentless efforts include battering the safe with a sledgehammer, his roars echoing with each swing. He then uses the stethoscope again, his taps revealing hollow THUNKS followed by a loud CREEEEEEEEAK. The safe door slowly creaks open. Marcus, entering the room, starts stuffing stacks of cash into a Santa sack. Willie, momentarily distracted, grapples with the choice between a pink and a purple stuffed elephant, ultimately settling on the pink one. Turning around, he finds Marcus and Lois, the latter surrounded by a cart overflowing with an eccentric mix of shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, and an abdomen exerciser.",
    "1320": "In the eerie stillness of a city alley, a sudden movement in the reflection grabs our attention. A dark shape grows larger, plummeting swiftly towards the ground. A dark figure clad in a tattered trench coat crashes onto the pavement, hands outstretched to cushion the fall. Pausing briefly to recuperate from the impact, the man slowly rises to his feet. His features are sharp and chiseled, his head shaved, and his eyes deep-set and piercing.\n\nHe quickly surveys his surroundings, finding nothing but towering brick walls above him. Suddenly, rain begins to pound down mercilessly. The man, whom we now recognize as Michael, pulls his overcoat tightly around his body and dashes towards the alley's exit. Just as he reaches the street, a fleet of police cars, sirens blaring, races around the corner, heading straight for him.\n\nWithout hesitation, Michael begins to remove his overcoat, revealing his bare chest covered in a tapestry of dark tattoos. As the coat falls to the ground, his silhouette, cast upon the brick wall, contracts and tenses. The rain intensifies its relentless drumming, echoing the descent of an unseen knife slicing through the air. A dense silence follows, punctuated only by the harsh patter of the rain.\n\nFacing a dark storefront across the street with unwavering resolve, Michael emerges from the alley, his facial expression a mask of pain and determination. He then executes a rapid descent through one of the skylights, smashing through glass and landing inside. Inside the building, Michael sprints for the sink, tossing in a first-aid kit. Under the harsh fluorescent light, he removes his trench coat, exposing his bare back crisscrossed with two horrifically open, gaping wounds between his shoulder blades.\n\nHe threads a needle with fishing wire and meticulously stitches the wounds closed. Blood pools on the cold cement floor beneath him. Clad once again in his trench coat and a fresh shirt, Michael proceeds through the building, scrutinizing endless racks of guns for just the right weapons. His every movement is swift and precise, hinting at a lifetime of training. He tosses an arsenal of savage weaponry into rifle bags, which he quickly fills and then heads for the exit, but the place is locked up tight.\n\nOut on the rain-soaked city streets, two weathered police officers cruise through downtown. One of them, Burton, stares out at the streetwalkers and shadowy doorways with a burning hatred, his finger raised like a pistol as he metaphorically eliminates one passerby after another. In the distance, the ominous pop-pop of gunfire rings out. The police radio crackles with an urgent cacophony of voices.\n\nJust as Michael lets the gun bags drop to the ground, he slowly places his palms on his skull, succumbing to an undisclosed pressure or threat. In this climactic moment, the narrative draws to a close, leaving us eager to uncover the secrets embedded in Michael's past and the destiny driving him through the stormy night.",
    "1329": "In the opening moments, a police car captures the group's attention. Kyle swiftly passes the shotgun to Bob. Charlie's face beams with hope upon seeing the police car, and she dashes from the diner as its door swings open. The three men spot her and begin to chase after her, but they halt abruptly as a figure emerges from the police car. Charlie freezes mere feet from the car, locking eyes with the familiar, piercing gaze of Michael, who seems unsurprised to see her.\n\nBob, Kyle, and Jeep swiftly form a protective barrier in front of Charlie, with Bob raising the shotgun. Michael pauses, his expression blank, then flashes a menacing smile, revealing a normal but imperfect set of teeth. The tension eases slightly, and Bob lowers the gun, but Michael's continued silence prompts Bob to raise the shotgun once more. Michael surveys the group and the loosely wrapped body nearby, the plastic tablecloth fluttering wildly in the wind. He turns back to Bob, shaking his head, and then stride towards Charlie with determination. Bob intervenes, but Kyle calls out something towards the road, causing Michael to disarm Bob swiftly.\n\nMichael moves to the trunk of the police cruiser, unveiling an impressive arsenal. He scrutinizes Jeep briefly before arming himself with twin MP5s and gathering boxes of shotgun shells. Suddenly, flashlight beams slice through the darkness, illuminating Michael's pale face. Above, a hatch opens, and out climb Michael, Bob, Percy, and Kyle. Before Michael can speak, two headlights pierce the darkness, revealing an ice cream truck slowly approaching the diner.\n\nThe men quickly follow orders, exchanging anxious glances while Charlie and Audrey peer through the window slats. The ice cream truck's headlights sweep across the diner, forcing Audrey and Charlie to retreat. Charlie pauses beside Jeep, resting a hand on his arm. Howard manages a weak smile at the sound of the calliope music. The ice cream truck comes to a stop, its headlights fixed on the diner. Everyone inside takes aim at the truck, steeling themselves for what lies ahead.",
    "1330": "In the eerie glow of the Ice Cream Truck's headlights, a grimy, blood-spattered shoe steps onto the ground, followed by a gaunt man in ragged coveralls. His bony frame is starkly revealed as he moves into the light, his tall stature becoming more apparent. He scrutinizes the diner, garage, and roof, taking stock of the situation. Above, men wait on the roof, tense with anticipation. Suddenly, the Ice Cream Man's jaw extends unnaturally, stretching wide. Fear grips everyone except Michael, who remains steadfast as the Ice Cream Man darts towards the diner with an unsettling, insect-like speed.\n\nMichael takes aim and fires, sending bullets ripping into the creature, knocking it flat on its back. Its limbs twitch and convulse in a grotesque display. Michael maintains his aim, poised for further action. The quiet is shattered by the rumble of engines and the glare of headlights as a stream of varied vehicles burst through a dust cloud, racing towards the diner. Chaos ensues as vehicles swerve and collide, dark shapes darting from the burning wreckage.\n\nAmidst the turmoil, Howard is brutally torn away from Sandra, his legs ensnared by an unseen force. Sandra screams, clinging to him as Charlie and Audrey rush to her side, grasping Howard's arms. Jeep, ready to fire, finds his shot obstructed and instead joins the struggle to keep Howard from being pulled through the window. A horrifying tug-of-war ensues, with Howard’s agonized screams filling the air as his body is stretched taut. Despite their efforts, Howard is dragged further out the window, mere inches from certain death.\n\nAware of the precarious situation, Kyle looks around the roof with mounting alarm. Jeep struggles to hold on, but ultimately Charlie and the claw-like hands gripping her are pulled back into the diner, the hands now severed from their owner. Michael leaps into action, brandishing a butcher’s knife and a machine gun. The window blinds erupt into a wall of fire, forcing Charlie and Jeep to scramble away.\n\nHysterical, Sandra tries to rush past Michael to rescue Howard, but Michael intercepts her, carrying her away from the window and placing her in a back booth. She is about to protest when Kyle rushes in, his initial excitement waning as he takes in the chaos. Bob grabs Kyle’s arm, and all eyes turn to Michael, who locks gazes with Percy. The room falls silent, everyone's attention now riveted on Michael and the desperate situation at hand, with Charlie reacting in shock as all eyes suddenly focus on her.",
    "1331": "**Movie Description:**\n\nCharlie bursts into laughter, the only response she can muster to the news delivered to her. However, her amusement is short-lived. Blanching, she sways, the weight of realization hitting her like a physical force. Michael nods grimly, and Jeep steadies Charlie with a hand on her shoulder as Michael decisively re-arms his weapon, the clank echoing ominously. Percy watches Michael with skepticism, while Kyle looks at Percy, his eyes filled with fear, before turning back to the ominous darkness and the evil it conceals.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob is a flurry of activity, flipping steaks with one hand while fiddling with his trusty Zippo in the other. He pauses briefly to take a swig of beer. Across from him, Sandra sits, lost in thought, a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills scattered around. Noticing her despair, Bob offers Sandra a beer, which she accepts with a weak smile. However, grief overwhelms her as soon as she speaks.\n\nAcross the diner, Audrey is engrossed in Percy's old radio. At the front, Jeep silently assists Michael in barricading the shattered window with broken table planks, his eyes drawn to the strange tattoos and jagged wounds visible on Michael's arms. Michael works steadily, driving the last nail into place before retreating to the roof, leaving Jeep deep in thought.\n\nUnder the faint glint of sunlight filtering through the dark red haze, Michael scans the horizon for movement. On the other side of the roof, Bob struggles to stay awake on watch, his eyes slowly closing.\n\nSuddenly, Sandra awakens with a start, whirling around, ears straining for the sound of her name. She turns to face the back door, blocked by a desk. Inching closer, she notices the transom window above the door and climbs onto the desk to look out. Through the window, she sees Howard, her husband, disfigured by breathing black boils. Paralyzed with horror, Sandra goes slack, only to struggle against Howard, elbowing Kyle in the face as he attempts to restrain her.\n\nAudrey pounces on Sandra, preventing her from opening the door. Percy leaps into action, revealing Howard nailed to an upside-down cross below. In the scuffle, Sandra slaps Audrey hard, sending her stumbling over Kyle and crashing to the floor.

Tears streak his face as he looks up at his comrades, holding out a note that seems to bear the weight of his sorrow. Meanwhile, the landlady ascends the stairs, with little Gavroche trailing behind. A door creaks open, revealing Valjean, his face etched with worry. He gestures towards Javert, bound and hidden in a shadowy corner. Their eyes meet, a silent exchange passing between them.\n\nAbruptly, Valjean's gaze shifts, spotting snipers creeping along the rooftops, their sights set on Enjolras. With swift precision, Valjean grabs a gun, firing at the snipers and sending them scattering. Other students join in, forcing the snipers to retreat as a burst of gunfire echoes through the street. When the smoke clears, Enjolras turns to Valjean, while Javert watches, grimly satisfied. Valjean cuts Javert free, then raises his gun, aiming it squarely at the inspector.\n\nElsewhere, Marius works feverishly to fortify a small barricade, while Grantaire's drunken singing is taken up more earnestly by Feuilly, bottles passing from hand to hand. Valjean, prowling through the cafe, pauses when he hears Marius's voice floating through a window. He moves closer, listening as Marius sings, his heart stirring with emotion. Later, as Marius sleeps, Valjean paces restlessly, unable to find sleep himself. He stops, gazing at the young man through the window, then kneels beside him, a silent sentinel.\n\nAs the camera pans out, the barricaded street comes into view, a tiny island surrounded by a sea of soldiers, their numbers stretching into the thousands. The rebels, most of them asleep, are oblivious to the overwhelming forces arrayed against them. Enjolras slips back into the barricade, his students stirring, ready for the inevitable confrontation. A tense silence hangs heavy, no one willing to flee.\n\nThe sun begins its ascent, casting golden rays upon Gavroche. A sharp crack rings out, and the young boy crumples, falling face down onto the barricade. Enjolras surveys his meager group, resolve hardening in his eyes. As the sun crests the rooftops, a hail of musket fire rains down upon them. Valjean moves fearlessly among the rebels, tending to the wounded, lifting down the lifeless, his own safety an afterthought. The big guns boom, their bombardment rocking the fragile barricade, signaling the beginning of the end.",
    "1336": "In the eerie stillness of a graveyard, Jean Valjean emerges from a church, striding towards a bell perched on a cliff's edge. He tears a yellow paper into fragments, casting them into the valley, where they dance and twirl in the wind before disappearing into the abyss. The scraps flutter, as the vast, steep mountainside descends into a dark valley. Our gaze is lifted, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne behind, ascending towards the radiant sun breaking through the heavens, the Alps looming in the distance. A solitary scrap of paper defies gravity, pirouetting in the sunlight. Then, we plummet, tumbling back through mist, cloud, time, and space.\n\nA panorama unfolds below: ships resting on mudflats at low tide, red brick factories standing stoically along the docks. The camera dives towards three galloping horses on a muddy road, heading towards the fortified town of Montreuil-sur-Mer, which sprawls along an estuary leading to the sea. As the riders approach, the poverty-stricken huddle around the gates, desperate and ill. Javert, ever stoic, takes in the scene as the police force their way into the harbour, pushing back the beggars.\n\nInside a sprawling workspace, women in conservative dress craft jewelry from shellac, a jet-black resin. The foreman pauses beside Fantine, a lovely young woman who starts, pricking her finger as he whispers in her ear. As the day ends, the women remove their overalls and pack up. Fantine retrieves a letter, but the head woman snatches it away. A struggle ensues, the letter passing secretly among the workers. The commotion pauses when the factory owner enters—it's Valjean, clean-shaven, well-dressed, transformed.\n\nSuddenly, Valjean's world crumbles as Javert materializes on the office balcony above. Below, Fantine pleads with the foreman, her cries echoing through the factory. Valjean, fighting his dread, returns to his office, showcasing some samples. He casts a sharp glance at the foreman, tension hanging heavy in the air.",
    "1339": "In the throes of shock, the judge finds himself speechless, then gently escorts Valjean out. A glimpse of something over Valjean's shoulder catches the judge's eye just as Fantine begins to convulse, her eyes glazing over as life slips away. Suddenly, Javert's unmistakable voice echoes behind Valjean. He turns to confront Javert, who draws his sword, the blade gleaming as it points at Valjean. In a swift move, Valjean wrenches a piece of timber from the roof, their voices clashing in a duel of song as they circle each other like predators.\n\nMeanwhile, Cosette attempts to store a broom, her actions mimicked mockingly by Madame Thenardier who sings cruelly. Cosette's terrified eyes peer from a tiny gap in the wall. Eponine enters from outside, and Madame Thenardier spots Cosette hiding rather than leaving. The innkeeper's wife steps out to open a meager frost fair stall on the porch, while her husband's gang, masquerading as customers, enters with a new recruit, regaling him with tales of Monsieur Thenardier's past escapades.\n\nMadame Thenardier welcomes the newest member inside, feigning an accidental drop of her hair comb. As the obliging customer retrieves it, she deftly picks his wallet. Thenardier, having stolen a pocket watch during a distracting handshake, fawns over his patrons, defiling a wine bottle he uses to serve them, and rifling through a groom's pockets.\n\nCosette, having filled her buckets at the well, trudges back, pausing occasionally to rest. She looks up in amazement to find Valjean standing before her. Inside the inn, Thenardier turns to his wife, and Valjean hands over money, adding more when demanded. He leads Cosette to the door and lifts her into a waiting cab. Madame Thenardier snatches the money from her husband, inspecting the notes just as Javert storms into the inn. The cab, with Valjean and Cosette, speeds away towards the city.\n\nInside the cab, Valjean holds Cosette protectively, his gaze fixed on her as she drifts into a restless sleep. The pair eventually turns down a narrow street, their hurried pace slowing. They navigate darkened streets and narrow alleys, darting into small courtyards, disoriented and uncertain. Valjean spots a crumbling section of wall and climbs over, desperate to evade Javert's relentless pursuit.",
    "1341": "In the dimly lit corridor of the Gorbeau Tenement, **Eponine lingers**, her gaze fixed on Marius through the door, a mix of longing and sadness etched on her face. She pauses, her heart heavy as she watches him leave, her feelings for him remaining unspoken.\n\nAs **Marius exits** the tenement, he is momentarily halted by a carriage passing by. Once it clears, his eyes fall upon two figures across the street. One of them is an elderly man, **Jean Valjean**, accompanied by a striking young woman, **Cosette**. The pair are returning from an evening church service, pausing intermittently to bestow alms upon the beggars lining the street. **Marius is captivated** by Cosette, his eyes locked onto her.\n\nFeeling his gaze, **Cosette looks up** and their eyes meet. She is struck by the intensity of his stare, as if he has known her for ages. Their connection is briefly interrupted when another carriage passes between them. **Marius proceeds** down the street and, as he looks back, Cosette's eyes find his again. Valjean, noticing the exchange, **instinctively wraps an arm** around Cosette, a protective gesture that shields her from Marius's view.\n\nMeanwhile, further down the street, a **sinister scene unfolds** in a dark alleyway. The **Thenardiers**, heavily disguised, lie in wait with their motley crew of thieves—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. As **Valjean and Cosette approach**, Thenardier steps forward, **luring Valjean** into the alley where Madame Thenardier sits, clutching a wailing infant. Cosette, still lost in thoughts of Marius, trails a few steps behind.\n\nAs **Valjean leans down** to observe Madame Thenardier, recognition flashes across her face. Thenardier **sheds his disguise**, and Valjean too recognizes his old adversary. With a signal, Thenardier summon his gang, who **close in on Valjean**, their intentions menacing. Suddenly, a door in the alley creaks open, revealing the hulking figure of **Brujon**. The commotion draws the attention of both **Marius and Gavroche**, who watch from a distance.\n\nJust as the thieves begin to **advance on Valjean**, the alleyway fills with the unexpected presence of **Inspector Javert** and his men. Javert takes note of the man with his arm around a girl but fails to recognize Valjean, who has averted his face. Turning his attention back to the Thenardier gang, Javert finds that Valjean and Cosette have **slipped away** in the confusion. Enraged, Javert **curses his lost opportunity**.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Thenardier **listens intently**, taking a keen interest in the developments. Meanwhile, Cosette turns to find Marius still standing at the end of the street, his gaze fixed on her. Unseen by Cosette, **Eponine enters** the scene, her heart heavy with unrequited love as she approaches Marius.\n\nTime passes, and the scene shifts to a quaint summer house, where **Cosette paces restlessly** in her bedroom. The window shutters are open, revealing an overgrown, untamed garden. **Valjean enters**, closing the shutters before retreating to his own, more modest quarters—a simple wooden shack adjacent to the main house. Cosette follows him, finding Valjean seated on his bed, his back turned towards her. Despite his humble surroundings, Valjean's love for Cosette is evident in the care he takes to provide her with the best accommodations he can offer. The air is thick with tension, as the weight of their unspoken feelings hangs heavy between them.",
    "1343": "In the hushed streets, the poor line up, their silent gazes filled with anticipation. A procession of dignitaries, clad in black and bearing laurel branches, moves solemnly along. Soon, a melodious hum resonates from the crowd, their voices harmonizing with the rhythmic beat of drums. Among the onlookers stand Enjolras, Marius, and a group of radical students. The dignitaries, sensing the growing song, exchange uneasy glances.\n\nA team of black horses, adorned with nodding black plumes, enters the scene, pulling a gun carriage draped in the French tricolour flag. As the coffin atop the carriage reaches the students, Enjolras boldly steps forward, waving a red flag and halting the procession. The students break from the crowd, encircling the carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and others ascend onto the carriage, with Combeferre leading the horses. Police and national guardsmen attempt to manage the surging crowd, but the people rally around the carriage, their passionate singing deterring police intervention. The students and the fervent crowd now commandeer the procession, veering off the main street and away from the planned funeral route.\n\nAs the procession turns, a cavalry division races ahead, disappearing around a corner. Gavroche's colossal elephant statue towers over the side street. Meanwhile, Grantaire wrests the last piece of Madame Hucheloup's cherished furniture—her favorite sewing armchair—and fortifies the barricade. Now complete, the barricade stands as an impressive twelve-foot wall, with a heavily guarded movable section. Two smaller barricades flank the cafe on either side.\n\nEnjolras scales halfway up the main barricade, addressing his motley assembly. Javert, disguised as a rebel, is permitted entry through the guarded gate. Atop the barricade, a lone flaming torch illuminates a red flag. All eyes turn upward as Gavroche appears at the summit.\n\nGuns swiftly pivot to target Javert, who stares back defiantly. Enjolras confronts Javert as bullets ricochet off house cornices, embed in the barricade, and wound several men. The red flag topples, its pole snapped. Everyone falls silent. Marius approaches a powder keg with the torch, but the soldiers have already retreated. Descending from the barricade, Marius finds himself surrounded by his comrades. He notices Eponine, propped against the barricade. With great effort, she retrieves a letter from her pocket and presses it into his hand.",
    "1345": "Louis spots Alice and attempts to halt his car, but fails, resulting in a forceful collision. Alice freezes, her eyes wide with terror as she looks back at her father's wrecked vehicle, debating whether to return. Louis, bleeding and seriously injured, manages to glance into his cracked rearview mirror. Alice, still unaware of the looming figure behind her, decides not to go back and begins to pedal away.\n\nDespite his pain, Louis struggles to exit his car, finding his door jammed. He crawls out of the passenger side, stumbling and screaming, his voice echoing through the distant factory and even more remote mountains, where an ominous plume of smoke rises, and a faint siren wails.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe stands with a sullen Charles at the counter, as Donny returns with a developed film envelope. Charles, after receiving his change, storms off with Joe in pursuit. The camera pans up along the water tower, revealing a mysterious cube affixed to its side, hidden from street view.\n\nArriving at Charles's house, a frustrated Charles storms inside, followed by Joe. Charles threads the film into the projector, and suddenly, Alice appears on the poster board—a scene from the night of the train crash. The filmed scene continues to play as Joe and Charles argue, the train crash happening so swiftly that the camera captures barely anything before it topples, recording only the settling debris.\n\nCharles and Joe move closer to the screen, the film projecting partially onto them. Joe's attention is caught by something on the screen. He slaps Charles's arm, drawing his gaze to the anomaly: a monstrous, mostly out-of-frame figure moving through the wreckage, its shape and flesh grotesquely bizarre. Only its legs are visible before it clears the frame. Suddenly, an air raid siren blares, its wail escalating through the town, both on film and from outside.",
    "1346": "In a quiet neighborhood, two boys exchange a frightened glance, their hearts pounding with anxiety. They hastily rewind and destroy a film, their hands trembling as they grasp the delicate material. Suddenly, the neighborhood is abuzz with activity; in the distance, military trucks, jeeps, and buses rumble down the streets. Confused neighbors emerge from their homes, chattering and watching as more vehicles approach. Amidst the chaos, Joe and Charles struggle to comprehend the scene unfolding before them. Joe flags down a passing adult, Mr. Harkin, who points towards the distant commotion.\n\nThe military buses screech to a halt, and soldiers swiftly usher residents onto the vehicles, their belongings hastily packed and strapped to car roofs. Panic surges through the crowd as people rush to find lost loved ones. Orders are barked, and complaints echo through the air. Walkie-talkies crackle, and PA announcements blare as soldiers methodically check wrist bands. Joe passes an arguing man and a soldier, the tension in their voices palpable. The neighborhood is a whirlwind of activity, with nearly a thousand people swept up in the evacuation.\n\nIn the triage unit, Louis lies on a cot, his head bandaged, and eyes open, muttering to himself in a state of shock and exhaustion. Joe, desperate to find his father, spots Louis and rushes to his side. Louis grasps Joe's shirt, pulling him close, his voice desperate and heartsick as he speaks. Joe's mind races, absorbing the weight of Louis' words. He whispers a response, and Louis looks at him with a glimmer of hope.\n\nElsewhere, Jen, Charles' sister, lounges on her cot, flipping through a magazine to select her Columbia House Records. Charles approaches her, his presence demanding her attention. Jen closes her magazine, her eyes narrowing with suspicion as she stares at him. She casts a vulnerable yet seductive glance before the scene shifts to Donny, who stands utterly stunned.\n\nThe boys, including Joe, Charles, Cary, and Martin, navigate through a sea of parked cars, ducking as soldiers pass by. They find themselves in a small, tiled room with no windows, the air thick with tension. Jack, exhausted and irritable, pounds on the door, his frustration boiling over. The door finally unlocks, revealing a humorless, armed soldier. Jack is led down a narrow, dilapidated hall, a semi-automatic weapon aimed at his back. As he passes an open door, he glimpses an empty office and a few military vehicles on the tarmac. His mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall. Suddenly, he is slammed to the ground by an unseen force, his eyes wide with shock and disbelief. What happens next remains a mystery, the scene cutting to black.",
    "1349": "In the eerie, hauntingly lit environment, the boys gather their courage. Joe moves toward the locked bulletproof glass door, trying the handle, but it remains securely shut. On the other side of the glass, Nelec, momentarily disoriented and breathing heavily, moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the boys. He tries the handle without success. The two find themselves face-to-face, with Joe witnessing the fear in Nelec’s eyes, recognizing that this moment shapes his fate. Nelec takes a moment to gaze into Joe's face, silently conveying his repentance. Instantly, Joe realizes he is about to watch Nelec's life end.\n\nSuddenly, SMASH! The creature begins busting down the bus door, smashing it to make an entrance. Joe hits the window again as the creature also strikes, and Nelec runs out of ammo. Joe hits the window once more, and CRASH! The window shatters, raining chunks of glass down on the boys who cover their faces. Cary sees the creature clearly. With the help of all the boys, Joe pulls himself up and climbs outside the bus, peeking out. The terrifying creature, its back to Joe, stands just fifteen feet away, focused on the door. Joe strains to climb onto the bus's roof.\n\nMeanwhile, the creature descends terrifyingly down the aisle toward Nelec. As it approaches for the final lunge, Nelec says something eerily quiet and terrified.\n\nElsewhere, Louis struggles to stand, his legs hurting. Suddenly, Jack appears, taking on the role of a supportive companion. As the two soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders, guiding him in the opposite direction. Louis looks confused but with a glimmer of hope in his eyes.\n\nMoments later, Joe pulls out his mother’s necklace from a pocket, revealing he took it from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack, and they turn to see a car approaching fast. It arrives, and it's Donny, wild-eyed and incredibly happy to see them. Donny looks at Joe with a pained expression.\n\nJoe drives while Donny sleeps in the passenger seat, and the other boys sit in the back. Quickly, Joe turns into a driveway, but pauses when he sees more tanks and military vehicles approaching. Their eyes widen as they realize they’re stuck. Gunfire continues. Swiftly, Joe and the boys get out of the car and run across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous military vehicles.",
    "1356": "In the opening moments, Alice drives nervously, her head shaking in disbelief. She then nods, not quite relieved but grateful for Joe's presence. A long, silent stare follows among them. The camera cranes down as a dusty Buick pulls up, and a group of boys clamber out, exchanging glances. Charles, holding a broken camera on a tripod, looks at Joe, who nods in acknowledgment. Alice finds an object on the passenger seat—a cube—and hands it to Joe through the window. He takes it and enters the house.\n\nJoe moves towards the living room, where Charles sits glued to the TV, watching a local news report of a train crash, the helicopter footage displaying the wreckage. Both are stunned by the scene. The camera pushes in on Charles, capturing his shift from depression to determination.\n\nLater, Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, crossing a bridge with a massive steel mill in the background. They pass under the town’s water tower and cross Main Street, where two military trucks drive by, an airman scanning the area with a handheld device. Charles opens his camera and pulls out the film, reacting with nervousness as he’s never smoked anything.\n\nThe scene shifts to a lower-middle-class house set against the woods. Joe stands with Alice at her front door, where she seems unnerved. Joe watches as Louis, the man arrested at his mother’s wake, gets out of a car carrying a small grocery bag. Louis darkens as he approaches Joe, stepping back as Louis arrives. Louis's demeanor suggests a mix of hatred and avoidance towards Joe. He goes back inside, followed by Alice, who turns to Joe, conflicted, before closing the door. Alone, Joe smiles, despite everything.\n\nSuddenly, loud pops echo: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Martin, as Detective Hathaway, fires a gun, shooting Cary, dressed in a dirty suit and turning into a zombie with wide, glossy white eyes. Cary slams his hand onto his chest, blood bursting all over him as he falls painfully to the ground.\n\nThe camera then reveals Charles behind his camera, yelling out. A wide shot rises past six bicycles thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe, and Preston, with Joe's dad's Kodak camera on a tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. The camera keeps moving over them to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, the train crash in the valley seems to stretch endlessly.",
    "1359": "In the gripping opening, a sense of unease washes over Alice as Jack's cruiser pulls up, disturbing her peaceful moment. Overmyer enters the scene, striding over to Nelec, who is engrossed in reviewing a folder. Their interaction is swiftly disrupted as Nelec's attention is drawn outside to the sight of the kids. Joe, caught off guard by Jack’s arrival, quickly retrieves his camera from Charles, following Jack's firm command. The tension escalates as Joe is instantly humiliated in front of Alice and swiftly taken back to the squad car. Jack forcefully opens the car door, directing Joe inside before angrily slamming it shut, then tosses the camera and tripod into the passenger seat, leaving Joe in the back as he marches towards the house.\n\nOutside, Nelec emerges from the building, moving towards Jack. A palpable sense of unease grips Nelec, evident in his demeanor. Jack pauses momentarily, turning to face a clearly discomforted Nelec, before heading off again. Inside the car, Joe’s breath is heavy. He feels his heart pounding as he watches his father engage with Nelec once more. Alice, watching from a distance, offers Joe a sympathetic gaze. The door to the house opens, revealing Jack, who steps aside to let Joe pass. Joe slams the door forcefully, his anger tempered with restraint. Jack begins to leave, but Joe, now enraged, voices his frustration. This abrupt outburst stops Jack in his tracks, leaving Joe's heart racing.\n\nJack moves menacingly close to Joe, who instinctively steps back, visibly intimidated by Jack’s intense presence. Jack suddenly checks himself, realizing the weight of his words and to whom he’s directing them. In this tense moment, Jack struggles internally, unable to reconcile his role as a father with his duties as a law officer. More upset with himself than with Joe, Jack exits the scene.\n\nJoe rides up a hill, revealing the town cemetery as he ascends. He sits, his back leaning against his mother’s grave, holding her open locket, lost in thought. A deep, distant sound breaks his reverie, prompting him to stand and pull out his flashlight. He aims the beam down rows of graves towards the caretaker’s shed in the distance. Another intense, low sound resonates, followed by a high-pitched metallic clang, causing Joe to back up nervously. More strange noises echo through the air, transitioning the scene to Jack's squad car arriving at an abandoned airfield.\n\nJack steps out of his car, blinded as three large military trucks switch on their headlights, all focused on him. He squints, trying to see past the medical machinery and IV tubes. In the background, Overmyer stands watchfully. A distinct silence envelops Nelec, simple and subdued. The scene shifts to reveal a battered and scraped individual lying in a medical bed, fear etched on his face but his spirit defiant. Dr. Woodward, feeling his time is running out, stands by the door, donning black gloves with a quiet intensity. Nelec offers the injured person a vague, searching smile, deepening the suspense of the moment.",
    "1362": "Mike leaves the stage door, stepping into the alley with a confused camera crew trailing behind him. Meanwhile, in the control room, phones begin ringing incessantly as Abby watches in horror. Defeated, she sighs and grabs the microphone for Mike's earpiece. On the monitor, Mike appears slightly bewildered but playfully licks jello off a girl's finger, waves at the camera, and is promptly pulled into a jello pool by thrilled girls who rip off his shirt. Drenched in jello, Mike enters the room to find Abby standing with crossed arms, barely concealing her fury. She walks away, leaving Mike puzzled and pursuing her.\n\nThe scene shifts to Stuart, who wears a serious expression, and Abby, who nods uncomfortably. She is modestly covered with cardboard cutouts of suns and clouds. In a moment of prudishness, she shields a cat's eyes but soon finds herself peeking through a window, only to see Colin stepping out of the shower. Leaning in, she watches as he begins flossing, clad only in a towel. Frozen briefly, she turns and walks away as Mike approaches.\n\nAbby retreats to her office with Mike in pursuit. Colin, dressed in a white doctor's coat, is on the phone discussing patient files. Mike eavesdrops, earning a glare from Abby who can't stop him. As the phone rings again, Abby's concern grows. She hesitates, then answers, her expression mirroring Colin's confusion on the other end. After a long pause, Mike hangs up and hurriedly ushers Abby out of the room.\n\nNight falls on the condo complex as Abby enters, stunning in a little black dress and heels. She attempts to seduce Mike, tracing her finger on his arm and leaning in suggestively, but he pushes her away and hides behind the couch. Abby opens the door to reveal Colin, whom she quickly ushers out. Realizing she's spoken her thoughts aloud, she pales and awaits Mike's instructions before trying to clean his khakis with a napkin.\n\nDuring a ballgame, the jumbotron camera captures a man catching a fly ball, then pans to Abby and Colin. To Abby's mortification, it appears as if she is performing an inappropriate act on Colin, catching the attention of the entire stadium. Colin waves and leaves, and Abby pretends to enter her house until he closes his door. She then rushes to Mike, embracing him tightly, despite his slight discomfort.",
    "1363": "Abby, with a smirk, rolls her eyes playfully before stepping inside. Meanwhile, Mike pauses mid-stride to glance back briefly, then continues on his way. Abby, her gaze averted haughtily, takes a seat on the couch, her eyes fixed on a box labeled \"ELECTRIC.\" Curiosity piqued, she opens it to reveal a pair of underwear and a remote control. Taking a moment, she admires herself in the mirror before joining Mike and Colin as they enter a bar. Immediately, buxom blonde twins, Bambi and Candid—known as the Jello Girls—rush enthusiastically towards Mike, drawing envious glances from Abby. The group settles down at a table, and Abby attempts to kick Mike, inadvertently knocking over her purse. The contents scatter, and the remote for her vibrating underwear rolls under the table, catching the eye of a precocious 8-year-old kid sitting nearby.\n\nAs Harold and Bob chuckle, Stuart gives Mike a friendly slap on the back. Suddenly, Abby's smile fades to horror. She squirms, trying to control her now-vibrating underwear, and leans down to retrieve her purse, only to find Mike's face inches from hers. He bursts into laughter, while Stuart watches worriedly as Abby resurfaces, frantically searching for the remote's culprit. The kid, mischievously, cranks up the speed even higher, causing Abby's eyes to roll back. As she attempts to stand, Stuart intervenes. Candi watches Abby's display with intrigue, while Stuart frowns in concern. Abby convulses briefly before rushing through the sensation, leaping to her feet as the group exits the bar. Mike seizes the remote from the kid, but Abby swiftly snatches it from his grasp, shooting him a pointed look.\n\nColin approaches the group, and later, on set, Mike addresses the camera. Nearby, a confused Joy looks at Abby, while Georgia winks at Mike. Abby, bewildered, looks at the agent, and then at the cab driver as Mike exits the lobby. She steps out of the cab, suitcase in hand, initially glaring at Mike but quickly masking her true feelings. The two sit together in the backseat, Abby engrossed in her notes while Mike studies her. She seethes quietly, acknowledging his correctness, and Mike looks at her, surprised.\n\nLater, the audience applauds as Mike takes a deep breath and steps on stage. Abby, now seated in the audience, watches Jay interview Mike. Later still, Abby chats on the phone, her expression shifting from surprise to suspicion. A waiter arrives with mojitos, and Abby takes a sip, her gaze fixed on Mike.",
    "1364": "In a moment of honesty, Mike sighs and decides to open up to Abby, but their conversation is interrupted when the waitress approaches. He stands, and Abby's gaze drifts to the dance floor, where even the least skilled dancers seem impressive. Seizing the moment, Mike takes her hand and guides her onto the crowded dance floor. They weave through the crowd and share a prolonged kiss. Later, Mike exits the elevator but abruptly turns back, pulling Abby to him. Suddenly, they are engulfed in a passionate embrace, their fervor preventing the elevator doors from closing, until a harsh buzzing noise begins.\n\nStartled, they separate, staring at each other breathlessly. Mike steps backward out of the elevator, a look of shock on his face, as the doors slide shut. Abby, flushed and stunned, collapses onto her bed, her expression unchanged. In a swift change of mood, she jumps up, fixes her hair, checks her reflection, and answers a knock at the door, discovering Colin standing there with a bottle of red wine. He enters the room, raising the wine as an offering. Meanwhile, Mike approaches Abby's door, barely concealing his shock as she appears behind Colin. Mike turns away and departs, walking down the hall in a state of confusion and distress.\n\nAbby rushes to catch up with him, trying to keep pace as he continues walking. He stops and they lock eyes for a long, tense moment before Mike looks away, shrugs, and walks off. Abby returns to her room to find Colin, still shirtless, holding a glass of wine. She takes it and drinks, continuing until the glass is empty. Initially pleased, her smile fades as she listens to Colin, eventually nodding and looking around the room. Overcome with a mix of pain, shock, and growing resentment, Abby steels herself with a fierce determination.\n\nLater, Abby and Joy navigate through a waiting area teeming with hopefuls vying to replace Mike Alexander, each unique in shape and size. Abby points out candidates while Joy diligently takes notes, a hint of worry on her face. In the control room, Stuart sits beside Cliff, watching as Jack Magnum delivers his introduction from a balloon basket during a live broadcast of the Balloon Fiesta. Mike glances at the TV, captivated by the live footage. Jack Magnum's performance takes a turn for the worse, alienating his audience until he is abruptly tackled and ejected from the balloon basket.\n\nIn a surprising twist, a frazzled Abby takes his place, her nerves steadied by a surge of adrenaline. Stuart and Cliff watch in shock from the control room, with Stuart answering a call that drains the color from his face. Seeing Abby on TV, Mike stares for a moment before grabbing his keys and rushing out, leaving Jonah calling after him.",

    "1372": "In the quiet of the night, a man departs from his house, drawn towards a distant light. Simultaneously, an elderly man approaches the same house, his path illuminated by a flickering torch. Upon entering, the man is enveloped by darkness. Ascending the stairs, he hears hushed whispers from above. The old man pauses outside the room where the voices originate, eavesdropping intently. A snake glides past him, slithering into the room. Suddenly, a figure named Wormtail appears in the doorway, his gaze fixed on the old man, who is visibly terrified. A loud spell is cast, jolting Harry awake in a state of panic and confusion.\n\nHarry, still flustered, watches as Hermione approaches Ron's bed, and they greet each other with a handshake. Together, they ascend a hill, where a lone boot rests atop the summit. The group gathers around, placing their hands on the boot. Harry rushes to join them, and in an instant, a white flash catapults them all through the air, eliciting cheers from the group. Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys tumble to the ground, while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric make a more graceful descent. Cedric extends a helping hand to Harry.\n\nAs they traverse a field, they discover a massive, cheering crowd gathered amidst a sea of tents. The group ventures into the throng, taking in the vibrant surroundings. Approaching a small tent, they find its interior magically expanded. Inside, they casually prop their feet on a table, quickly hiding them as Arthur passes by.\n\nA grand stadium looms on the hillside, its structure towering with numerous floors. The Weasleys and Harry search for their seats as Lucius Malfoy and Draco pass below. The games commence with a spectacular display of balloons, fireworks, and aerial performances by green and white figures on brooms, leaving trails of color in their wake. A glittering leprechaun dances in the sky, followed by daring stunts performed by red-clad figures. Viktor Krum waves to the roaring crowd, and Harry enthusiastically joins in the excitement.\n\nSuddenly, chaos erupts as the crowd surges in panic. Harry is trampled and loses consciousness. When he awakens, the once-bustling grounds are deserted, and a man wanders through the debris, kicking at remnants. With a spell and a malevolent grin, the man conjures a ghostly skull in the sky, a snake writhing from its mouth. Harry, witnessing this demented display, flees in horror, clutching his head in pain as he gazes at the monstrous apparition above.",
    "1376": "The film opens with Ron gasping sharply, while Hermione storms off in a huff. Meanwhile, Harry is ascending a set of steps, eventually colliding with Cho, who has suddenly appeared around the corner. Ron, looking shaky, is helped into a room, where he shakes his head in apparent disbelief. The Patil twins casually stroll past as Ron, with a panicked and uncomfortable demeanor, gets dressed in ridiculous dress robes in front of a mirror. Harry enters, dressed more conventionally in a suit, and sniffs at his clothes. Together, Harry and Ron descend the stairs into the hall, with Ron fidgeting uncomfortably with his outfit. They approach the Patil twins, one of whom looks directly at Ron.\n\nHermione, elegantly dressed up, enters the room and walks down the stairs, where Viktor Krum takes her hand, and they dance together. Soon, others join in the dancing, including Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr. Filch and his cat, and Hagrid with Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye Moody sits on the sidelines, drinking. The crowd begins to jump excitedly, while Harry, Ron, and their dates sit some distance away, looking miserable. After a great time with Viktor, Hermione approaches them but quickly walks off. Harry then walks up to his friends, and together, he and Ron leave the scene.\n\nThe story shifts back to the old house, where a sleeve is rolled up, revealing a marking of a skull and snake on the arm. Harry wakes up to the sound of creaking floorboards as someone approaches his bed. A chuckle is heard, and the figure dances off. Harry nods thoughtfully. He then takes off his clothes and gets into the bath, placing his golden egg on the side. The ghostly figure of little Myrtle floats around, eventually getting into the water with him. Harry submerges the egg and himself underwater, leading Myrtle to laugh and Harry to feel embarrassed.\n\nMad-Eye Moody suddenly appears in the doorway, followed by Neville emerging from behind a bookcase. The Weasley twins are heard shouting, busy taking bets. Harry walks along with Neville, holding some green plantlife in his hand. He puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking. A cannon fires, and the champions enter the water; three dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater, the effects of the gilliweed take hold, transforming Harry's hands and feet into webbed appendages. He leaps into the air like a dolphin, and the crowd cheers.\n\nHarry swims among the fish and rocks, still searching. He finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons tied by their ankles. Cedric is there and takes Cho with him. Harry begins to free Ron and Hermione, but vicious merpeople appear, posing a threat. Suddenly, what looks like a shark approaches at high speed, revealing itself to be Viktor with legs. He takes Hermione and heads for the surface.",
    "1380": "In the gloomy setting, Sirius Black lets out a bitter laugh, a cold amusement gleaming in his eyes. Remus Lupin, momentarily distracted, turns back to meet Black's gaze and nods in silent agreement. Suddenly, their wands are disarmed, flying from their hands. The room's attention shifts as everyone turns to find Severus Snape standing in the doorway, a smug smile playing on his lips. As Sirius Black moves closer, Snape presses his wand firmly against Black's neck, his eyes hardening with resolve. With a quick gesture towards the door, Snape signals for the others to leave.\n\nAs the group begins to exit, Harry Potter's gaze flickers towards the table where his wand lay, forgotten by Lupin. In an instant, the wand is back in Harry's grasp. With a swift and powerful spell, Snape is lifted off his feet, crashing into the wall with a resounding thud before slumping to the floor. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger stand frozen, their faces a mask of shock. Harry, too, looks slightly stunned but quickly recovers, turning his attention back to Black. As Harry raises his wand, pointing it at Sirius, the convicted murderer responds with a mirthless laugh. Black then redirects his focus, pointing instead at Ron. Ron pales, his face draining of all color as fear grips him. Scabbers, his pet rat, squirms violently in his arms. Lupin and Sirius both turn their scrutinizing gazes towards Ron, who holds Scabbers protectively. The two men exchange a knowing glance, neither uttering a word.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Pettigrew's beady, watery eyes dart nervously between the windows and the door, plotting an escape. Seizing his chance, he makes a desperate dash for freedom, only to be casually thwarted by Sirius, who shoves him back with ease. Pettigrew's nose twitches as his eyes meet Harry's, his hands fluttering anxiously to reveal a missing index finger. Emerging from the shadows, Pettigrew begins to babble desperately, pleading his case. Harry studies him briefly before looking away, his attention now drawn to Hermione, who is fixated on the full moon outside. Harry's gaze shifts once more, settling on Lupin, who stands as a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching ominously. Shaking his head, Lupin's wand begins to tremble in his lengthening fist as Pettigrew's eyes dart around the room, taking in the scene. As Lupin's wand drops, Pettigrew seizes his chance and leaps.\n\nHarry locks eyes with Pettigrew's glassy stare as he conjures his Patronus. The spectral stag flickers briefly before fading away, leaving Harry’s vision filled with the twisted forms of Dementors drawing ever closer. Sirius Black gasps, silvery feathers of light tumbling from his lips as if his very soul were leaving him. A blinding light splinters through the trees, revealing a fiery stag with a luminous body. The stag charges on, its radiant light expanding, illuminating the forest and driving the Dementors away like scattered ashes. As the light ebbs, the stag flickers and disappears, leaving only a single thread of light in the palm of a man standing deep in the trees. Harry studies the familiar silhouette, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared.\n\nIn the peaceful setting of the hospital wing, Ron lies in a bed opposite Harry, his leg bandaged. Hermione paces anxiously before stopping, her shadow rippling against the curtains that surround Harry's bed. Professor Dumbledore enters, handing Harry and Hermione each a stick of chocolate before preparing to leave. He pauses, smiles, and then exits, leaving the trio in silence. Harry looks curiously at the chocolate, but Hermione does not respond. Instead, she loops the long chain of a pendant around both Harry’s neck and her own, binding them together.",
    "1388": "Harry disguises himself with Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat. Meanwhile, Fudge nervously surveys the area before nodding toward the pub, leading Rosmerta and McGonagall inside. The scene shifts back to Hermione and Ron, with footprints tracking through the snow into the pub. Ron and Hermione briefly appear past a frosted window, followed by the sight of three shrunken heads swinging into view. Rosmerta looks to McGonagall, who nods grimly. Suddenly, the pub doors fly open, revealing Main Street where Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the cold. As they look down, the camera tilts to show footprints appearing in the snow, marking the end of Harry's point of view.\n\nAt the end of a rocky outcrop, the footprints stop, and sobs are heard. Ron tries to discourage Hermione from going further, but she persists, filling the footprints with her own and gently drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the mist, his eyes stinging with tears.\n\nThe scene transitions to a serene outdoor setting where butterflies flutter over a great green lawn. The Giant Squid breaks through the last glaze of ice on the Black Lake, and the Whomping Willow shakes water from its branches. Inside, the dying sun streams through high windows, painting Harry's face a fierce amber-red as he stands opposite Lupin. Ancient charts drape the walls, and gleaming spheres of spun glass orbit one another silently. Lupin paces before a large trunk, snapping his fingers to bring Harry's wandering attention back. Lupin nods, and suddenly, a Dementor mutates into a silvery white orb.\n\nHarry glances toward the window at the bloody sun, then looks up into Lupin's eyes, emotional and nodding. He takes a breath, and Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness before opening the packing case, revealing the Dementor once more. The hair lifts off Harry's scar, and he sets his jaw, his hand and whole body trembling. However, he holds his ground, and a huge silver shadow bursts from the end of his wand, hovering between him and the Dementor. The Dementor falters, and Lupin nods.\n\nLater, all the boys are asleep except Harry, who lies in bed studying a photo of his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a guttering candle. The camera begins to move, creeping forward, but it's only an old man in a painting, scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. Harry makes to follow, then stops as the wand's spot dances across the parchment, finding another dot. He stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and turns into the harsh glare of Snape's wand. A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips as he eyes Harry coldly, lowering his wand. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes glitter, and to Harry's horror, words begin to appear. Snape studies him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips.",
    "1390": "The trio pauses, battling their tears. Suddenly, four ominous shadows emerge from the hut. One of the shadows, Dumbledore, lifts his hand and gestures, redirecting the group's focus away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore speaks briefly, his words indiscernible from afar, and the crows screech loudly. The executioner separates from the group and vanishes behind a cluster of low trees.\n\nSunlight glints off the axe as it rises above the treeline, lingering for what feels like an eternity before dropping out of sight. A sickening chop echoes through the air, and Ron and Harry stare in numb disbelief. Hermione, her face turned away, trembles. Gradually, her hand rests on Ron's shoulder, and the camera follows her movement down Ron's arm to his hand, where a drop of blood hangs from his finger and falls like a tear. Ron gazes at his hand, at the blood trickling down his finger.\n\nHis eyes flicker, catching sight of Scabbers darting away. Ron sprints after the rat, with Harry and Hermione in pursuit. Reaching the summit, Ron vanishes over the top, followed closely by Hermione and Harry. Ron catches Scabbers, cradling the rat in his bloody palm. Spinning around, Ron looks toward Harry, who glimpses an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog bounding toward him through the gathering gloom. Harry shields himself as the dog leaps clear over him and disappears into a gap at the base of a tree, dragging Ron through.\n\nHarry and Hermione navigate a primitive passageway, ducking the roots overhead. Abruptly, the tunnel ends, and they glance about, confused. Looking up in unison, they spot a small opening. Harry hoists himself through and pulls Hermione up. Stains resembling dried blood mar the floorboards, and shattered furniture lies scattered around. The ceiling creaks ominously, prompting them to dash to the stairs.\n\nEmerging, they see a wide, shiny stripe cutting through the dust-laden floor, as if something has been dragged to the end of the hallway, where a light seeps from a door. Harry follows the paw prints to a pair of filthy human feet, then slowly looks up at the man standing in the shadows. The man's filthy, matted hair hangs to his shoulders, and his skin resembles that of a corpse. He studies Harry's face intently. Harry draws his wand, his hand shaking violently as he eyes the man, Black. The moment is taut with tension, until Lupin steps forward and embraces Black like a brother. Harry and Ron stare at Lupin, dumbfounded.",
    "1002": "Gatsby surveys the scene while standing, resting on a cane. He looks at the clock on the mantelpiece, which has a robust, angular dark wood surround, then at his watch. Gatsby paces and then undoes a button on his white jacket to sit, frowning. Nick sits, looking quite relaxed, as Gatsby freezes and breathes tensely. Nick goes to look out of the window and sees a car coming up the drive. He hurries outside, holding an umbrella. Grey-faced, Gatsby sits with a newspaper as the driver puts down a rug and Daisy steps out of the car onto it. She wears blue and gold shoes, a flouncy purple and pale blue dress with frills, and a hat to match. Daisy walks in and checks her immaculately bobbed blonde hair in a mirror, then looks into the room full of flowers. Nick waits in the hall as Daisy walks into the room, amazed. He looks unsure and walks into the room to find Daisy admiring the orchids. Confused, he looks to the chair and the window, noticing the French windows are ajar. Nick smiles at Daisy who hands him her hat. He goes to the front door and finds Gatsby outside, soaked through. With a steely-eyed, determined look, Gatsby marches into the cottage, stops in the hall to smooth back his hair, and walks into the flower-filled room. He stops for a moment to look at Daisy, who turns sharply and sees him. They gaze at each other across the room, Daisy's chest heaving as she breathes deeply, her eyes appearing glazed and entranced. Gatsby steps forward and regards her with an earnest expression. Nick watches from the hall, wide-eyed, as Daisy continues to gaze at Gatsby, dewy-eyed. They both nod slightly. Later, the kettle boils, and Nick carries a tray with a shiny silver tea set into the room. As he pours tea, Daisy sits on a couch and Gatsby stands leaning against the mantelpiece where the wooden clock sits. Nick finishes pouring tea through a strainer and exchanges furtive and nervous looks with Daisy. Gatsby steels himself and turns to Daisy, smiling, then knocks the clock off the mantelpiece, breaking it. He tries to push the bit that broke off back in place but, with a final bash, gives up and sits across the coffee table from Daisy, resting his chin on his hand. Nick stands between Gatsby and Daisy, hands them cups of tea, and sits on the couch next to Daisy. They all look rather uncomfortable, and Nick stares into space as Daisy and Gatsby steal the occasional glance at each other. Nick suddenly springs to his feet as, on the porch, Gatsby holds up a hand.",
    "1008": "Others stare ahead dazed and incapable of movement. One man wipes tears from his eyes. Another man approaches the front of Buckingham Palace and places a bouquet of flowers at the gate. More people arrive with bouquets of flowers to place at the railings. Tony and Alistair watch Earl Spencer read a statement on TV. A woman enters. A smiling Alistair puts down the phone. The woman hands Tony another phone. Tony's hand covers the receiver. He waits a moment. Then, raises the phone to speak. As a servant arranges cutlery on a table, Robin enters the dining room. The Queen strides down a corridor that has stags heads mounted on the walls. Two maids stand aside to let her pass. In the study, the Queen picks up phone from a desk. The Queen sits behind the desk. Cherie enters the room behind Tony. Prince Phillip enters the study wearing a kilt. Tony sits on a sofa, while Cherie stands close by. He puts the phone down. Cherie moves round and catches his attention. The Queen and the Queen Mother dressed in black walk to a nearby car. The Royal Family staff watch the broadcast. Robin stares impassively at the image of Tony on the TV. Charles, accompanied by Stephen and various men, walks through a vast lobby with high ceilings and huge windows. Striding down a corridor, Charles suddenly stops outside a room. He pauses for a moment before entering. Charles slowly enters the room and a glass door shuts behind him. Charles stands before a casket and waits a moment. He then walks around to the head of the casket. Seen from outside the room, the view of Charles is obscured by the frame of the glass door. A priest can be glimpsed speaking while Charles has his hand over his mouth and looks in grief at the casket before him. Later, Tony sits in the backseat of a car which is driving down a motorway at daytime. Tony hands the phone to his female assistant, then glances out the window. Charles descends from a plane down some stairs. On the runway, he shakes hands with Lord Airlie. Charles and Airlie walk over to meet various uniform men standing nearby. A line of soldiers carry a casket above their heads. Charles approaches Tony. Charles and Tony look at the soldiers with the casket. Nelson Mandela appears on TV. The Queen fiddles with her pearl necklace. Phillip picks his finger nails while the Queen scratches her wrist. Nighttime, two Range Rovers pull into the courtyard at Balmoral. The Queen looks at the vehicles from an upstairs window. She watches as two men exit from the lead vehicle. The Queen turns away from the window.",
    "101": "She looks up at the sky where the moon shines above. Forrest lies in a hammock on his boat, then stands at the helm, slowly gliding by the docks. He looks around and notices something, bending down to get a clear view. Meanwhile, Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan and smiles, surprised. Suddenly, Forrest's boat glides, crushing a dock, and both Forrest and Lt. Dan look at it. Out on the gulf waters, Forrest's shrimping boat is alone. Forrest looks up and sees Lt. Dan sitting in the rigging. He empties the net as an all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands. Back at the church, Lt. Dan is sitting in his chair at the back. Instead of participating in the service, he takes swigs from a liquor bottle. A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck as Lt. Dan lowers himself from the rigging. The wind begins to blow strong and water sprays on deck during a hurricane. Lt. Dan, on the rigging, shouts and shakes his fist as he is pelted by wind and rain. Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the boat. An anchorman appears on TV, standing in front of a pier which is later shown ruined along with the boats. Forrest's boat comes down the river and he and Lt. Dan empty their net, revealing a huge catch of shrimp. Lt. Dan opens another big catch, which drops open on top of yet another huge catch. In response, Forrest and Lt. Dan smile. Elsewhere, a man sitting on a bench listens to Forrest. An ELDERLY WOMAN sits next to the man and watches as he laughs while walking away. The elderly woman looks at the magazine and at Forrest with surprise. Back on the boat, Forrest and Lt. Dan are working and Forrest looks a little surprised as Lt. Dan smiles, then looks away. Suddenly, Lt. Dan pulls himself out of his chair to the railing and jumps into the water. The television shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford while Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck back home.  Forrest opens the door to find the doctor standing next to Mrs. Gump in bed. The doctor looks down at Forrest's legs before leaving and closing the door. Forrest takes off his hat and steps over to her. With the elderly woman, Forrest sits as she cries and wipes her eyes with a hankie. A bus stops and Forrest looks at the elderly woman before riding a lawn tractor to mow the football field lawn. He takes out a letter and opens it as the choir and members sing nearby. New furniture is taken inside a building and a new cross is placed on the steeple.",
    "1010": "The Queen gives the corgis food and they look up at her before running through the clearing. Video footage shows crowds of people lining up in a queue, a sign is seen, and floral tributes cover the ground. Later, Charles talks with Steven, Tony looks at Cherie and then leaves her with her paperwork. Elsewhere, the Queen sits at a desk writing in a book but suddenly stops. The next day, three Land Rovers drive away from Balmoral. On Wednesday, Robin stares out of a window with a blond woman sitting behind him, a man sticks his hand up, and Tony stares back at them. The Queen signs the letter, Robin looks from Prince Philip to the Queen, and she walks over to a desk, sits down, and picks up a phone. She glances at the sun, puts Tony on the speaker, and glances at Prince Philip. The Queen arranges pens and a magnifying glass on the desk. Tony casts his eyes skyward, stands up, and looks out of the window, gazing out for a moment before picking up the phone on his desk. He puts down the phone, pauses, and then leaves his office, stroking his chin thoughtfully. Tony stops beside a female secretary, who sits behind a desk. At Balmoral, the Queen exits a Land Rover and enters a building. She drives through the hilly and woody countryside, continues along a long, bumpy, and barren road running parallel to a river until it runs down to the river's edge. The Queen plows into the waters and heads across the ford, rocks and potholes on the riverbed jolt the car until it comes to a sudden, violent halt in the middle of the river. She steps out of the car, into the mountain waters, and inspects the underneath of the vehicle, continuing to examine other parts of the Land Rover. The Queen holds a mobile phone and dials a number. Back at Balmoral, Thomas sits at a desk. The Queen hangs up the phone, removes her head scarf, and gazes at the serene countryside surroundings before shutting her eyes for a moment. She looks down, frowns, then looks up. The vast landscape dwarfs the figure of the Queen, who sits on the riverbank by the vehicle, her back turned away. Her body gently rocks as she starts to sob. After a few moments, she turns to her left and sees a stag on the opposite side of the river, standing still.",
    "1011": "The Queen stares at a stag, seemingly transfixed. The stag lowers its head to eat some grass while the Queen continues to stare at it. She looks to her right, then back at the stag, which remains still. The Queen turns back to her right, then back to where the stag was, but it has vanished from sight. She breaks into a smile, casts her gaze skyward, dabs some tears with a handkerchief, and wipes her nose. Later, Tony stands before a mirror, putting on a tie. Video footage shows the ground completely covered with flowers and members of the public gathered around an arrangement of candles on the ground. Tony addresses some members of the public. As the Queen sits watching TV, Prince Philip enters. She looks from Philip to the TV, then gets in bed and removes her spectacles. Philip climbs into bed next to her. On Thursday, Tony sits in bed, watching TV. Newspapers are strewn all over the Queen's bed. She removes her spectacles and wears a worried expression on her face. Tony raises his eyebrows. Outside Balmoral, the Queen walks with some Corgis, then walks back with the Corgis running after her. She enters the kitchen and the staff stop working, then leave while a servant places a phone on a table. The Queen stares at the phone for a moment. Later, in the kitchen, she sits back and tugs at her scarf around her neck. Robin enters the kitchen behind her. In a corridor in Balmoral, the Queen paces up and down outside a door. The Queen Mother stands up and both walk in the garden. The Queen stops walking for a moment. Later, she sits on a sofa in the study and sips a glass of iced single malt. On the misty hills, a gillie hands a mobile phone to Prince Philip. Charles enters the study while the Queen sits on the sofa, her back to him. He turns and leaves the study, and the Queen remains seated. The gates of Balmoral are all opened by two men. Range Rovers slowly emerge, flanked by four bodyguards. Flash photography is taken as the doors to the Range Rovers open. The Queen emerges, accompanied by Prince Philip, Charles, William, and Harry. They walk up to the huge collection of flowers, which are arranged outside the gate. Tony sits reading some paperwork and glances up to watch the TV. He smiles, walks to the kitchen table and playfully messes up the hair of one of his sons. The Royal Family continue to look at the flowers outside Balmoral, and are watched by a large crowd of onlookers.",

A boy leaps off a jetty towards a lake and is frozen in midair. The traffic helicopter for a local news program flies over Sacramento, California. Names appear beside the white silhouetted symbols for a woman, then a man. The symbols have red hearts on them. A young woman comes out of her house, talking on her phone. A phone rings. The smart, attractive, blonde woman, Abby, arrives at work at the local TV station, KSXP. A control room. A cooking show on a studio set. Technical director, Cliff, turns to Abby. The chef swigs wine from a bottle. Mary has a swig. Abby's boss, Stuart, switches off his monitors. In the toilet. In a restaurant, Abby sits at a table with the guy. Abby takes out his profile. He looks peeved. Later that night, Abby walks past an illuminated fountain. She heads along a path through the pretty ornamental gardens outside her apartment building. She lets herself in her front door, and her cat, D'Artagnan, trots over. Abby looks thoughtful and a little sad. As she gets ready for bed, a TV plays in her bedroom. D'Artagnan treads on the remote and changes channels. He gobbles a marshmallow on the end of a long skewer. He slurps a coffee. She looks at Mike, haughtily. Grinning, he shakes her hand. Abby paces in her office. She rolls her eyes. On the studio lot. He gets between them. He snogs her. Larry throws Georgia over his shoulder and carries her off. Abby's lying on the floor in her office closet. Frowning, Abby sags. Abby pulls the closet door shut. A girl cycles past a garage apartment on a leafy street. Mike walks into the apartment. He dumps his bag on a chair and presses play on his answer phone. Frowning, he crosses himself. Mike grabs the answer phone. Mike goes next door with his nephew. Mike's sister, Elizabeth, has a cake for him. The upstairs of Abby's apartment has a balcony. Light streams through open French windows. In her bathroom, Abby runs her fingers through her long, blonde hair. The cat's by a broken fishbowl. D'Artagnan trots out of the window. He's up a tree. Abby stands underneath the tree. She climbs. She looks across to a neighboring balcony. The French windows are open. Inside, a handsome, muscular guy is wrapping a towel around his waist. Abby clamps her hand over the cat's snout and ogles the guy. He flosses his teeth, and Abby grins. The branch breaks. She hangs upside down.",
    "1015": "The guy runs out and his towel falls to the ground. Abby covers her eyes. Inside, D'Artagnan cozies up to the guy. Abby's mouth hangs open in a big, toothy grin, her eyes twinkle, and she is transfixed. The guy points to the door and reopens it. Abby dances for joy. On set, the makeup girl goes. Abby roughly forces an earpiece into Mike's ear. Outside, the chicks pull him in. Mike licks the red Jell-O off one of the girl's fingers and gives an approving nod. Abby takes deep breaths as Mike comes in with the bikini babes. The babes head off and Abby walks off. Abby wakes up from her naked weather-girl nightmare. Abby and Joy are in the tea-break area of the office and look at the ratings. Mike walks in. Tall, thick-set Mike follows Abby to her office. Sitting at her desk, Abby gives Mike a challenging look, picks up a card and the phone, and dials. Mike grabs a phone to listen in. Mike hangs Abby up. Mike flops into a chair and puts the phone on hold. He glances aside and nods, looking at the timer on Abby's phone display. Abby looks thoughtful. At the hospital, handsome, clean-cut Colin keeps holding. In a cafe, then in a boutique, they look at dresses. A saleswoman is present. Abby holds a dress against herself. On the way home, sitting in Abby's living room, Mike reaches down the side of the chair and picks up some knitting. He frowns and quickly dumps it back on the floor. Abby comes downstairs looking extremely sexy. She wears black stilettos and a figure-hugging, low-cut black dress that stops at her knees. Her long, blonde hair hangs loose in flowing curls. She smirks and strokes his chest. He slaps her bum. Mike crouches behind the couch and smiles, giving Abby the thumbs-up. Abby does a little victory dance, punching the air. At the baseball game, the pitcher pitches and the batter hits. As Abby and Colin walk to their seats, Mike talks to Abby on an earpiece. He sits nearby. She munches popcorn and gives an exaggerated shrug. The batter sprints around the field, and the fans stand up excitedly. Colin tries to get the attention of a food vendor. A girl grins at Mike and lifts the hot dog to her lips. Shocked, she spills her drink in Colin's lap. A cameraman films Abby as she rubs the stain. Her head is bent over Colin's crotch, and her hair swishes back and forth, making it look like she's doing something quite different. She looks up and sees herself in a heart-shaped video screen above the scoreboard, the Kiss Cam. Abby and Colin walk home.",

They smile and chat, heading along a winding road through mountains, across a steel girder bridge, and through rolling countryside. Sitting on rocks beside a creek, Abby and Colin have a picnic. They clink glasses and drink wine. Colin teases Abby with some caviar, then pops it into her mouth. He looks away. She chews, winces, spits the caviar out, and grimaces. Abby quickly wipes her hand across her mouth, composes herself, and smiles at Colin. Abby and Colin walk barefoot over rocks spanning the creek. He wraps his arms around her, and they share a lingering kiss. In a coffee shop, Colin buys coffees for Abby and Joy. Grinning girlishly, they go to a table. As Colin pays, Joy mimes giving him a good seeing to, clenching her fists and thrusting her groin. On set, Mike's spooning chocolate into the mouth of a sexy babe. A man delivers a bouquet of red roses to Abby. Her mouth hangs open, and she and Joy do a little dance. Seeing Joy and Abby so excited, Mike's face falls. He turns back to the babe and sees he's smeared chocolate over her face. Distracted, he wipes it off. Mike and Abby sit in the SF Saloon and Grill. Abby's on the phone. She smiles at him. Mike's checking out an attractive woman wearing a crop top, who's standing at the bar, drinking a shot. Abby looks round at her. He stares at her intensely. Abby drinks her wine. Mike frowns, taken aback. Mike looks troubled. Abby watches Mike on the monitor. Abby steps up. Abby frowns. She goes to see Stuart in his office. She rolls her eyes. Los Angeles, the expensive modern facade of the Century Plaza Hotel. Abby arrives outside the entrance in a yellow cab. A bellman opens the door, and Abby gets out. Abby walks through the lobby. They're driven through town. Abby watches, smiling. Mike looks uncomfortable, then forces a smile. La Noche Cubana restaurant. Mike walks up to a hostess. She leads Mike away. The colorful restaurant is decorated with palms. Abby sits in a booth overlooking the dance floor, where couples salsa. She's on the phone to Stuart. Mike sits and smiles at Abby. He nods. Abby sips her drink. A waitress walks up. Mike looks at Abby. Abby smiles thoughtfully. He takes her by the hand and throws his jacket aside. Mike leads Abby onto the dance floor and spins her. He turns and ducks under her arm and pulls her close. They smile and dance together, back and forth. Mike spins Abby and leads her. She steps away, holding his hands, and returns with her back to him.",
    "1021": "They slowly drag out of view. Sadie focuses on her homework. Playing air guitar, Charlotte advances toward Sadie's bed, then retreats to the doorway and flings one arm out. Her sister ignores her. Leaving the door open, Charlotte sulks away. Now, Debbie steps out of a side door and opens a trash bin. She breaks up a pack of cigarettes and throws them away. She overturns a small pouch into the bin. She goes back inside. Pete comes out the same door with a plate carrying three cupcakes. Setting it aside, he opens the trash bin and overturns a large jar of candy. He throws the cupcakes in one at a time. Pete pauses at the last cupcake and takes a deep breath. He unwraps the cupcake, then takes a large bite. He starts to throw the rest in, then hesitates and takes another bite. Chewing blissfully, he holds the remainder over the trash. Pete leans in, devours the treat, and throws the last bite away. Now, he jogs on a treadmill with electrodes dotting his bare chest. In another exam room, a technician positions Debbie at a mammogram machine. A doctor stands close with his hand up Pete's hospital gown. In another office. Now, she sits in a dentist's chair. Now, Pete's doctor snaps on a latex glove as Pete leans over a table. His doctor bends close from behind, thrusts his finger out of view and works it around. Now, Debbie sits with her feet in stirrups. Two women enter separately. The doctor winks. Now, at home. Debbie joins Pete in a sitting room. Trying the sitting room door, Charlotte finds it locked. Debbie moves away. Now, a gray-haired man steps out of a modest house. Pete approaches as a plane passes overhead. They hug. Now, they sit in a living room. Pete smiles tightly as his dad cuddles the little blonde boy. Two more boys arrive identical to the first. Pete follows him out back. He sprays the boys with a hose. Pete sighs and follows his father back inside. Pete swallows hard as his eyes widen. With his lips apart, his dad drops his gaze then looks up. Pete's dad follows his middle-aged wife to the backyard. Now, in an upscale restaurant. Debbie approaches the hostess. She points to a balding man wearing a jacket and tie sitting alone. He browses a menu at a table for two. Debbie stares at him as she takes a deep breath and rolls her shoulders. Later, he takes a bite of food. He raises an eyebrow. She shakes her head with a sad smile, then lowers her gaze. He takes out his phone. He steps away, leaving his phone on the table.",
    "1022": "Debbie looks down at her untouched plate, then shifts her eyes to her phone and picks it up. She scrolls through pictures of her dad's family, including one of him huddled with his young wife and two children, another around a soccer ball with the kids in uniform, and a final photo with his arm around his young daughter. Debbie pouts and slides the phone back. She sits with Pete and the girls around plates of vegetables, sighing as Sadie storms away. Later, Pete and Debbie drive down the coast and pull up to a luxury resort. They hold hands as they walk away from the beach and enter a bright hotel room. Debbie tosses her hat on the floor and hops onto a bed. Pete pushes open double doors leading to a balcony overlooking the ocean, then rushes onto the bed and kisses his wife. In bathing suits, the couple jumps into a pool, where Pete holds and spins Debbie, and they kiss, sinking under water. They lie in bed and share a long embrace, with Pete pulling away with a satisfied smile before tripping off the bed. Now in robes, they scarf down cookies and jump on the bed. Pete pulls up his robe and aims his butt at Debbie. They open their robes and embrace, then passionately kiss while lying down. A waiter pushes in a dessert cart, and Pete does a magic trick, holding a banana and oranges to his crotch. The waiter stands in shock as Debbie crawls and scurries across the floor. A starfish protrudes from Pete's underwear. They binge on desserts, with Debbie shoving it in her mouth. Pete sticks his tongue in her overstuffed mouth, causing bits of dessert to fall out. Back in the car, the hotel recedes in the distance. Debbie holds out her hand, and Pete squeezes it, giving her a loving smile. They share a tender look before turning back to the road. As they pull into their driveway, the smile fades from Pete's face and Debbie tightens her lips. They linger in the car as Sadie and Jodi emerge from the house. Pete turns to Debbie with a cold stare. In Charlotte's bedroom, she glares at Pete, and he shrugs before sitting in the corner. Later, Pete rides his bike with a group. At the house, Debbie enters the kitchen, then finds Pete in the bathroom, lying back with his legs in the air. She enters with an astonished expression as he takes cell phone photos of a mirror aimed at his spread butt cheeks.",
    "1024": "Pete sits on the toilet playing a game on his tablet. Debbie opens the door dressed in a slinky outfit, then leaves, carelessly sliding the door shut which bounces back open. Pete flips her off. Later, they are in a club and face several men. He removes a partial denture which Desi puts in her mouth. Desi drapes her arms around Debbie, who laughs as the younger woman pulls her clothes. Desi returns the partial to a man with a shaved head who snaps them in and smiles. They are at the Belasco where the crowd stands as aging rockers take the stage, many seats remain unoccupied toward the back and the balcony. At the bar, Pete has a furrowed brow and Ronnie gives them a cowed wave. At the dance club, Desi and hockey players surround Debbie as she pumps her fists. Later, the two women writhe sideways across the floor. Now, Desi sways between two hockey players and Debbie snakes side-to-side behind her. Debbie twirls her long, sweaty hair. A tall, boyishly handsome hockey player with a blonde beard dances with the two women, does air claws with Debbie, then sits with her. His mouth hangs open, then he smiles. At the Belasco, the band sits at a table while roadies clear the stage and the two rockers leave, patting each other's backs. Pete sits in his car with his eyes glistening, his mouth twists in a sob, he hangs his head and squeezes his eyes shut, lifts his head back with his chin quivering, his gaze calms, he swallows hard, then bursts into tears again. Debbie's car pulls up at an upscale apartment building with a doorman out front. Debbie stares at Desi awkwardly and Desi nods giving a proud smile. Pete lies on the bed using his tablet as Debbie enters with her sweater open and a nipple exposed. Pete glances between his tablet and his wife, eyes her up and down, then closes the tablet case. She covers herself and walks away as Pete remains in bed fully clothed with sneakers on and grabs the tablet. Debbie reenters fully clothed, glares at Pete, raises a brow and nods. In her room, Charlotte plays her keyboard. Debbie slowly shakes her head and Pete's mouth hangs open as he glares at his wife. Debbie nods with a disheartened gaze, puts her hands on her hips and looks at the floor. Pete stares forward as she walks away, raises her arms, then leaves the room. Lying between her parents, Charlotte sucks her fingers.",
    "1025": "Sadie lies at the foot of the bed and turns around. Charlotte touches Sadie with her slobbery fingers. Sadie hops out of bed and storms off down the hall. Sitting up, Charlotte faces her dad. Charlotte jumps off the bed and scurries away, leaving a wide gap between her parents. Glancing at Pete, Debbie yanks the bedspread toward her and faces the TV. They both stare forward. Sitting at her desk, Charlotte writes a note in red marker. She hangs it on Sadie's door. Pete wears headphones at his desk. Sadie watches something on her tablet. Now, Debbie lies with Charlotte in her bed. Debbie leans over and kisses Charlotte's lips. In the morning, Pete awakens on the couch, hanging off in an awkward position. He props himself up and grips his shoulder. Now, Pete sips coffee at the island with his back to the table as his family eats breakfast. Pete glances back, then eyes his mug. Now, Pete drives the kids to school. He sloppily eats an egg sandwich and sings. Sadie eyes her father, then looks away. Charlotte's eyes widen. Now, at school. Charlotte puts on headphones as Pete walks her to class. They pass the gray-haired pregnant woman. Pete stops his daughter and kisses her on the head. He starts to leave. A fat woman approaches with Joseph. Joseph stands a dozen feet away. He pokes her several times. In a coffee shop, Debbie sits with Jodi. Debbie grabs her phone. Jodi narrows her eyes. Now, in a school office. Debbie nods. Jill glares. Debbie shrugs. Pete nods slowly. Now, they exit the school and walk side by side, both wearing mischievous grins. Debbie glances at Pete, who glances back. They continue walking, coyly avoiding each other's gaze. Entering the parking lot together, Debbie moves in front of Pete and heads to her silver SUV. Pete strolls toward his blue Sedan and pulls the keys from his pocket. He briefly glances toward her. The couple enters separate vehicles at the same time. Later, at home. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table as Debbie serves the chicken. Debbie looks at Pete. Sadie storms away. Sitting down, Debbie rests her head on her hand. Later, in her room, Sadie sits on her bed doing homework. Charlotte's door slides open across the bathroom they share. She emerges with an armful of things. She places Sadie's computer, phone and tablet on her bed, then leaves. Sadie grabs her phone and smiles. She looks toward her younger sister as the door slides shut. Downstairs, Debbie sits on the couch as Pete paces. Pete moves close. They embrace. A main character, Jack, lies on the ground dying as a plane flies overhead.",
    "1029": "At the Hilton, Ryan sits in the low-lit bar, savoring a cool drink, watching a young woman who is staring at her cellphone. In her other hand is a set of car keys. She looks at her key fob, incredulous. They sit, comparing loyalty cards. She stares at the card. Alex's eyes sparkle. She studies the concierge key. Alex smiles thoughtfully. Ryan smiles. They head to a room. Alex is an attractive woman with long, straight auburn hair. He tries a swipe card at a door, but it doesn't open. He opens the door with another card. They go in. Alex, in her 30s, with a curvaceous figure, walks across the room, naked apart from a tie around her waist. She lies on the bed. The sheets are unruffled. Ryan is laying on cushions on the floor. Alex and Ryan sit facing each other and open their laptop computers. They both type an entry and close their computers. Ryan stands by as Alex opens her hotel room door. She turns to him. They kiss. They smile. She goes inside. She closes the door. He hangs a sign on the handle. Ryan swims in the hotel swimming pool. He has his shoes shined and hires a car. Hertz employees swipe his loyalty card through card-reading machines. In a gents outfit, as Ryan looks at ties. He takes out his cellphone and looks at the display. Circular fields in various stages of production stretch to the horizon. The fields are green, brown and muddy yellow. Grid pattern city streets. Ryan arrives in Omaha. In his apartment block, Ryan pulls his case along a hall. He lets himself into his small, sparsely furnished apartment. He puts his keys on a worktop, pulls back a brown plastic concertina screen and lays his case on the bed. A young woman comes in holding a large envelope. She knocks on the worktop. Ryan takes out a large photo of a hugging couple stuck on a board. She smiles at him fondly and goes. Ryan looks at the photo of the smiling couple. A modern office building. The boss, Craig Gregory, has a meeting with Ryan and his colleagues. Prim, ponytailed Natalie stands by a screen. A guy appears on the screen. Ryan frowns, worried. Ryan goes to see Craig. Ryan smiles, bitterly. She sits facing Ryan. Chastised, Natalie sits back and looks down. Later, Craig goes to see Ryan in his office. Ryan is standing, staring at a map of the U.S. Ryan turns to Craig. Ryan raises his eyebrows. Craig curls a piece of paper and holds up a finger. Craig shakes his head. Ryan screws up the piece of paper and throws it in the bin.",
    "1032": "Natalie's taken aback and Ryan grins before they arrive at the hotel. Natalie's face crumples and she starts to sob. Ryan frowns awkwardly and holds out his hands, and she falls into his arms. Ryan sees Alex and gives her a little embarrassed wave. She comes over, and Natalie shoots Ryan a look and frowns. Natalie raises a drink to her lips, and Alex smiles broadly. Natalie looks down thoughtfully, and Ryan gives an I-told-you-so look. Natalie looks uncertain as they walk through the lobby and go to the registration desk for the Alpha-tech party. Ryan and Alex casually pick up name badges and neck bands. Looking a bit shifty, Natalie does the same and follows them around a corner. The threesome clip their name badges to their neck bands and hang them around their necks. Alex reads Natalie's name badge. At the party in the hotel ballroom, Natalie, Alex, and Ryan are at the bar getting drinks. They turn around and survey the scene. People stand at small white tables with shiny balloons floating on ribbons above them. Ryan, Natalie, and Alex go stand around a table. Natalie has a gulp from her drink, nods, and smiles. She looks at Alex and walks onto the dance floor. Alex grabs Ryan, and Alex and Ryan dance together. Natalie wanders about on her own, moving to the music. A young guy with a stubbly chin bops about and notices Natalie. He leans to her and she smiles. She looks at her name badge. A DJ on the stage, a big black guy. Ryan and Alex have their picture taken in front of a backdrop of a giant wave. They squat, hold out their arms, and pretend they're surfing. Natalie and Dave pose for pictures. A bit drunk, she drapes herself all over him. Dave holds Natalie up as they leave the photo area. On the dance floor, Alex and Ryan face each other and shout. Everyone points in the air and jumps around. Later, Ryan and Alex are at the table. He hands her a key card, and they both smile. Natalie sings karaoke on a yacht in the harbor. A few drunken party guests, including Dave, are there. Alex and Ryan sit on a platform at the back of the yacht. He dangles his feet in the clear, blue water. They gaze at each other, then share a lingering kiss. The power fails and all the lights in the yacht go out. Ryan and Alex look back towards the city lights, some distance away. Everyone gets a ride back to land in a small pontoon boat. They jog up onto the sandy beach. A courtesy bus delivers the group to the hotel. They run into the entrance barefoot. Ryan wakes up in bed.",
    "1033": "Alex is already dressed and looks at her, bleary-eyed. She leans down and kisses him. He beams. Alex goes. Ryan and Natalie have breakfast at the hotel's outdoor cafe. They sit at one of many tables under a blue umbrella. She stares at him. They walk along a pier. Natalie has the photo of Julie and Jim. Natalie holds up the photo. The cardboard cut-out photo blows into the water. Ryan kneels on the edge of the wooden pier and reaches for the photo. He falls in the water. In his hotel room wearing a white towel and robe, Ryan dries the cut-out with a hair dryer. Ryan drags his case through the airport. Julie and Jim poke out of the top, looking a little wrinkled and worn. Detroit. The airport is shrouded in a snow storm. Ryan and Natalie drive along an icy road. They glance at each other awkwardly. Ryan parks in an office car park. He and Natalie get out. She holds an arm full of strategy packets. A security guard leads them through a busy, open plan office. They go into a smaller office. Craig's on a computer screen via a video feed. Ryan looks at the screen and frowns. She smiles nervously. They prepare the packets. A thickset bald man appears on a computer screen in front of Natalie. Ryan sits with Natalie. Ryan and Natalie look up. They realize Mr. Samuels is in the next office on the other side of an opaque glass screen. In distress, Mr. Samuels' chest heaves. He picks up the packet. He looks down and starts to sob. Ryan frowns and looks between Natalie and Mr. Samuels on the screen. The heavyset man shakes with grief. Natalie's eyes rove. She licks her lips. Craig watches on his screen. Mr. Samuels looks down. Startled, he gets up and walks out. Ryan and Natalie watch him wipe his hand across his face as he walks past the office therein. Natalie looks unsettled. She nods slightly. Natalie looks down at a list of 40 names. Her eyes flit nervously. Number one is Mr. Samuels. She crosses it out. In the snowy car park, Ryan talks to Craig on his cell phone. Natalie leans on the car. Ryan frowns as he listens. He hangs up and turns to Natalie. Later, in the north terminal of Detroit airport, Ryan and Natalie stand silhouetted against a large window. Outside, the nose of a jet looms. Standing on a moving walkway, Ryan looks at the wedding invitation. Natalie is behind Ryan. Her smile fades. Natalie walks ahead. Ryan stares thoughtfully at the wedding invitation and the RSVP slip. He stops, turns around and heads back the way he came.",
    "1040": "The chase mounts a pedestrian area and crashes down a wide stone staircase, then rejoins the main road. Other cars desperately veer to the side as Taylor powers onward. Barnes swerves to avoid a collision and mounts the pavement. He wrestles with his steering wheel as Javier looks back and sees Barnes lose a little bit of ground. The chase continues. A fire engine bounds towards Taylor. The fire engine holds. Both Taylor and Barnes brake on the turn. They accelerate along parallel lines. Barnes drives through a pedestrian colonnade. Barnes spots two cars in the way and brakes. Barnes is thrown around as the hatchback breaks through the gap. Taylor and Javier look behind them as they join a busy road. The chase weaves through slow traffic. Javier pulls his gun. Taylor clips another driver, who hits a parked car. Barnes powers through the flipping vehicles, as Taylor looks back anxiously over his shoulder. Javier lowers his gun. He leans out of the window and fires. Two bullet holes appear in Barnes' windscreen, and Javier sits back into the police car. Taylor looks in his rear view mirror and steers. Then handbrake turns the police car round a corner and into the path of a truck which loses control. As Barnes rounds the corner, the truck smashes into the hatchback. Pedestrians scatter as Barnes is sandwiched between the truck and the nearby wall. Taylor smirks. As they proceed along the underpass in the shadow of an elevated road, Enrique steps from behind a pillar. Taylor stops the car and Javier gets out. Javier shoots the armed Enrique, then points his gun at Enrique's face. Howard films nearby, then spots Anna crossing the road. Barnes pushes the windscreen out of the wrecked hatchback and climbs out onto the road. The truck driver holds his arms out. Barnes pulls his gun and heads for the underpass. Veins stand out on Javier's forehead as he presses the gun up to Enrique's forehead. Barnes takes aim some way back. Javier spins and opens fire. Barnes fires back as Taylor starts the police car. They both land shoulder hits, and Javier grabs the door of Taylor's car. Taylor pulls a gun and shoots Javier point blank as he accelerates. Barnes gives chase on foot as Enrique dies by the roadside. A shot from Barnes shatters the back windscreen and hits Taylor in the shoulder. Taylor looks dazed and loses control of the car. Then veers onto the curb and crashes into a concrete ramp which smashes through the windscreen. Javier lies dead on the road with his face resting against his right arm. Barnes approaches the police car with his handgun held out in front of him.",
    "1041": "He strides to the elevator and presses the Call button. He presses his earpiece and enters the elevator. As he exits, he hears two other colleagues, Holden and Matthews, with Taylor. Barnes strides past them. Taylor follows him to a car. They all move to cars as President Ashton emerges from the elevator. The President gets into the car by which Barnes and Taylor are standing. They follow him in. The convoy, headed by the two motorcycles, sets off from the underground garage. Behind the motorcycles is a police car, then two four-by-fours with their tailgates open. Then two stretch limos with more vehicles bringing up the rear. Armed police line the route. Armed men in uniform are on rooftops and behind barred gates. In the Presidential limo, Taylor grins. Protesters grow rowdy as the motorcade passes them. The convoy stops by a statue of Pizarro at Spain. The Secret Service agents spill out. His car door is opened. Taylor and Barnes climb up. Barnes scowls as he scans the press photographers. His narrow face is permanently grim as he turns from the cameras and walks around the car to join Taylor and the President. Taylor and Barnes lead the way. The President is behind them. Holden and Matthews bring up the rear. Taylor glances across at Barnes as the group makes their way to the plaza. They emerge through an archway of the crowded plaza. The President strides towards a child in its mother's arms. He shakes the baby's hand. He greets the flag-waving crowd, grasping hands as he passes. Barnes spots a man wearing dark glasses slip his hand into an inside pocket. The man's camera drops to the ground. The presidential party continues, Holden replacing Barnes at the front. Barnes now behind the President. Two soldiers on the roof. President Ashton climbs red-carpeted steps onto a podium placed in the middle of the plaza, which is filled with a flag-waving, cheering crowd free from protesters. The balding man now walks to a lectern. Barnes and Taylor stride across the podium and stand facing out towards the sea of yellow and red flags. Standing amongst the crowd is a chunky man in a blue and white checked shirt. He holds a video camera. Barnes notices a curtain twitch on an upper floor. Taylor follows Barnes' gaze. Barnes goes to speak into a mic in his cuff, but stops. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the window and the curtain. He speaks into his mic. Taylor and Barnes exchange a look. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt pointing his camera at the upper floors behind him to where Barnes saw the fluttering curtain. The man turns back around checking his camera.",
    "1042": "He looks down from the window at Barnes and Taylor. The Mayor waves to the crowd, then steps back from the lectern to welcome President Ashton with a handshake. Barnes sees an open window. A muzzle flash illuminates the window, and the President reels back before falling. Taylor yells to a stunned Barnes. Barnes looks back up. A bearded young man dashes to the podium. Barnes tackles him. Barnes stares down at the recumbent President. Taylor helps carry the President away. The President is loaded into an ambulance. The bearded young man is led off. An exasperated look on his face, Holden turns away. They loop up on hearing the distant explosion. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt. He runs to him and grabs his camera. Barnes points. They rewind the camera in vision. Both men stare at the LCD screen. Flames and black smoke rise into the air. The smoke clears. Barnes is lying on the ground. He regains consciousness. There is a scratch on his grubby face. Barnes hauls himself to his knees. Barnes struggles to get to his feet. There are small fires all around. A man throws a blanket over a woman whose clothes are in flames. Barnes takes in the number of people lying injured. Barnes recalls the muzzle flashes in the window. Across the plaza, Matthews, clutching a chest wound, tries to sit up. Barnes runs across to him, past the mess of twisted metal crowd control barriers. Barnes bends down. Holden staggers over. Matthews falls still. Holden shakes his head. Barnes stares at his fallen colleague. Holden looks up to see the Spanish bearded cop with a gun. Holden chases after the bearded man who has holstered his gun. Barnes looks up as a GNN cameraman runs past. Barnes reads the GNN logo and leaps to his feet. He runs to the GNN outside broadcast van and enters the gallery. Barnes stares at the bank of monitors. The director watches him. Barnes sees a still frame of him being shot. Barnes searches for the cell phone. Rex watches as Barnes keys in numbers on his cell phone. He speaks into his cuff mike. He dials a number. The PA whispers into her cellphone. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the monitor. Karen glances around and manually rewinds the tape control. Barnes looks intently at the screen, his eyes unblinking. Barnes turns and runs out of the van. The events rewind. Barnes turning to Matthews. The explosion, the shooting. Taylor at Barnes' hotel door. The time on the digital clock moves to midday. The bearded man, Enrique, a handsome man in his 30s wearing a light open shirt over a dark tee shirt and with a bag over his shoulder, marches past the protestors on his way to the plaza.",
    "1049": "A lady's hand works on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Darcy emerges from the parsonage, lips drawn tight, and pulls on his dark leather gloves. Inside, Lizzie begins to pace around the drawing room. Tears spring into her eyes. Darcy hurries into a room upstairs and stands in the middle of the room, looking deeply troubled. He dashes over to a bureau and pulls out a sheet of paper. Picking up a pen, he dips it into an ink pot, then sets about writing a letter. He replenishes the nib with ink. He puts down the pen and leans back in his chair with a defeated air. He goes over to the paned window. Two young boys with their fishing rods and nets scramble down a hill towards the river. Darcy, striding through cloisters in his gown and mortarboard, throws open a door to find Wickham in a compromising position with a lady. Wickham just smiles at him. Darcy hands Wickham a check. At the door, Wickham turns and bumps into Darcy's sister. He kisses her hand, looking up at her with a flirtatious smile. Georgiana and Wickham walk arm-in-arm by the sea. Darcy's carriage pulls up at the sea front. He jumps down and peers over a wall. Wickham and Georgiana are on the rocks below together. Georgiana spies her brother, her face breaks into a smile. When the door has closed behind Wickham, Georgiana turns her sorrowful gaze to Darcy, then slowly walks over to be comforted by him. Letter finished, and now disheveled Darcy leans wearily back in chair and closes his eyes. Then, with renewed energy, he dips his pen in the ink pot once more. Outside, the sun is setting, casting a salmon pink glow over Rosings. The next morning, Darcy splashes his face with water from a silver basin, then pats it dry. He's still wearing the same white shirt from the night before, with the top few buttons undone. His manner is troubled and agitated. He snuffs out last night's candle, which is all but burned out. On the bureau is the sealed letter addressed to Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy wanders over to the breakfast table. Lizzy heads out, leaving the others to resume their breakfast. It's a bright, sunny day, and Lizzy's taking a walk in the park, swinging her bonnet casually to and fro. Suddenly, she breaks into a run, racing as fast as she can across the grass. She slows down to a walk again, and heads onward through the trees, not really taking in her surroundings. Suddenly, she becomes aware of a man standing with his back to her, a few meters ahead. He turns, just as she's trying to slip away unnoticed.",
    "1056": "The curricle continues on its way with Mr. Collins perched on the back. He then stands in the parlor as Jane, Lizzie, and Mary enter. The three girls sit down, but Jane and Lizzie soon rise from their seats. They sit back down again, and Mr. Collins regards them with condescension. The three sisters stand, watching him coldly. He backs out of the parlor and makes his way over to the curricle outside. With a sympathetic shake of the head, he climbs up into the carriage. Lizzie and Jane come out to see him off and wave him off. Kitty peers out from behind a wall and bustles over to the house. Lydia sits, looking out of a lead-paned window, humming happily to herself. She glances over at Wickham, who smiles. At Longbourn, Jane runs up the stairs and bursts into Mrs. Bennet's room. She wafts the vial under her mother's nose. Mr. Bennet arrives home in the pouring rain, where Jane and Lizzie are waiting for him. He steps inside, takes off his top hat and black cloak, and heads into his study, closing the door behind him. Jane and Lizzie watch him with some concern and exchange worried glances. Mr. Darcy wanders through a cobbled street, bustling with people and horses. He makes his way down the crowded street, looking slightly lost. A young beggar girl stops him to ask for money, and as he searches his pockets for coins, he asks her for directions. She indicates the road he should take. He finds the house he's looking for and bangs on the door. As the door opens, a woman looks shocked to see Darcy. Her housekeeper quickly tries to shut him out. The Bennet sisters are still sitting in the parlor. Jane puts down her book and is just going to pour the tea when Mr. Bennet comes in. All four girls look at him expectantly as he takes a seat. Kitty is sobbing. Seeing Kitty's distress, Mr. Bennet's face falls, and he leaves the room. Mr. Darcy is back out, searching the darkened streets, clutching a piece of paper in his hand. He gazes up at a house. Lydia, meanwhile, is getting more and more bored by the minute. She gets up off the bed and wanders over to the window. Wickham drinks wine. A young man is galloping along on horseback in the bright sunshine. The housekeeper at Longbourn peers out of the window and, seeing the messenger arriving, quickly hurries out to meet him. He pulls a letter out of his saddlebag, dismounts, and gives it to her in exchange for a few coins.",
    "1059": "At school, young women walk with books balanced on their heads and lead to dance, circling the hall in pairs. They use whisks in the cookery class. Heavy snow is falling as a teenage girl with long dark hair, wearing a school uniform, walks down a suburban street. Girls are playing hula hoop in the playground, breathing on a cold window, and making foot shapes in the condensation. They play lacrosse and, in class, daydream and doze. A girl scratches the back of her ankle with her other foot as a graphic paper plane flies into a bin. The girls daydream and look bored. Her father sips his juice while Jenny is at orchestra practice. A young boy next to her on violin stares at her, and she waves to an older fresh-faced lad in the violin section. The youngsters take the mickey and Jenny sighs in frustration. Jenny and the violinist exchange glances as they play. Later, Jenny frowns at the sky and leaves orchestra practice. She stands getting soaked at the bus stop as a car speeds past, nearly running over a woman with a pram and a young boy. The car pulls over beside Jenny, and she avoids eye-contact with the handsome driver. He gets out of the car, runs around to put the cello in the back seat, gets back behind the wheel, and drives up at walking pace beside Jenny. She hops into the passenger seat, and David changes gear. They arrive on Jenny's niche tree-lined street as a large black car overtakes them. David nods and gives a tight smile, and Jenny smiles and gets out of the car. Lying on the floor of her room, Jenny sings along with the record which spins on the small player on the floor. Jenny winces as Graham flounders and he resorts to his tea. On another day, Jenny meets the card in a large bouquet of flowers. Her father frowns while her mother smirks as Jenny strides off on the garden path. David crosses the road in front of them, and Jenny agonizes. They shake hands, and Jenny heads back to her friends. They sit awkwardly in the living room, Jack studying David. David gallantly kisses Marjorie's hand. David and Jenny run through the London rain, up stone steps to the concert venue. The men and women pair up and go in. Jenny admires glamorous blond Helen, touching her fur stole. The pair walk off together, and Helen taps Jenny playfully on the shoulder. Jenny and David listen with rapt attention to the concert while Helen looks unimpressed and sleepy. Danny concentrates serenely, and Jenny smiles to herself as she listens. Later, everyone files out at the concert hall and walks to the night club, where a platinum blonde singer fronts the band.",
    "1061": "She looks at him, shifting awkwardly. David smiles but squirms at her discomfort. He indicates that's a yes. Jenny smiles and pulls her nightie off her shoulders. David heaves a sigh. Embarrassed, Jenny avoids eye contact. Then David smiles, stands and moves to her. He pulls her nightie back on. He goes to kiss her but hugs her instead. Her arms remained by her sides. Then she puts them round him. They hold one another. Sun shines on the small village. The Bristol pulls up at some old-timbered houses. Jenny stands completely aghast as the men walk away. She and Helen walk through a cemetery. They've slipped a picture in the back of the car. Jenny stops playing ball with some children and harries over. The picture, a map is sitting between Jenny and Helen on the back seat. Jenny eyes him wearily. Later they arrive at Danny's place. Jenny takes her bags and strides off. Pausing at the cab Jenny doesn't even look at David. She stops angrily on the middle of the road. She turns to him. He wonders over wanting to explain. He looks at her imploringly, then grins. She can't help to grin back. He takes all of her bags. She makes a show of pulling away. He takes her hand and twirls her around. They hug and slow dance in the street. On a colonnaded balcony, Danny hold up two glasses. At night the Bristol arrives back at Jenny's house. Jenny sits glumly in the passenger seat. David looks across at her. Wearing a tight smile, she doesn't look at him. He smiles lovingly at her, looks down. Very slowly they lean together and kiss. She pulls away. They smile then sit awkwardly. Jenny puts her handbag on the kitchen table. She shows it to her father. Marjorie stops her cake baking. She goes to look at the book. Jenny licks cake mixture off the whisk. She grins to herself. At school the girls are in their PE gear out for a run. Jenny and her friends are hiding behind a tree smoking. The teacher arrives. The girls file out of the classroom. Tina sticks her tongue out. Jenny enters the head's wood-paneled office. The headmistress watches Jenny leave. At home, the dining room is in darkness. Graham has come for tea. Jenny closes her eyes. Marjorie puts the candle decked cake down in front of Jenny. Jack switches the lights back on. Marjorie drops Graham's slice of cake. Jenny unwraps the present. Jenny tries to look pleased. She shows Graham. Jenny accepts the gift with a tight smile. She places it on the other one. Jack gets up to answer the door. David is laden with presents.",
    "1065": "They stare at each other and she smiles breathlessly. Drover smiles suavely at her, and she grins broadly. Allsop signals to the band. Drover makes his way down the steps towards the teeming dance floor. He and Sarah move slowly towards each other. She smiles in delighted disbelief and he grins, his hand casually in his left pocket, as they come together. She smiles demurely. Arm-in-arm, they head for the dance floor. Carney's wife and the other women stare at them. Up on a balcony, Fletcher grabs a black waitress' hand. Sarah helps him through the steps. Carney watches and swigs from a bottle. Up on the balcony, Fletcher does the same. Carney watches the dance, laughing heartily and drinks deeply. Drover and Sarah dance cheek-to-cheek. She smiles and nods. In the night, lightning flashes over Darwin Wharf. He looks at her seriously. She turns and looks up at the storm clouds then closes her eyes, tilting her face up to catch the rain. They kiss as it starts to pour down. The crowds at the pub cheer the rain's arrival and dance in the street. At the outdoor theater, the audience leave their seats. All except Nullah, who continues to stare, transfixed, at the screen. The ball guests huddle on the colonnaded verandah of the house where Carney holds court. People dance around Drover and Sarah in the rain-soaked street. Sarah holds her hands joyfully in the air. Goolaj remains in his seat at the theater smiling happily at the down pour. Smiling, Fletcher staggers towards the soaking dance floor, trips over a plant pot and falls flat on his face. Sarah kisses Drover. Carney steps away from his daughter to approach Fletcher. Sarah and Drover continue to kiss passionately. Their eyes lock together, but closes the cab door rather then get in. A servant holds an umbrella over Carney's head as he walks up to the fallen Fletcher. He scowls at his drunken son-in-law and walks off. Fletcher nods slowly, watching him go. On the screen, Dorothy clicks her emerald heels together. Drover and Sarah run up the stairs to Sarah's room with the balcony. Indoors, they kiss passionately. They break apart and stare at one another. They look longingly at each other. Naked in bed, they make love tenderly. He kisses her neck. They touch gently. He slides the dress off her shoulders and she opens the front of his shirt. She pulls the shirt off his muscled torso and, in just her petticoat, pulls him down onto the bed. They lie in each other's arms, naked, covered by just a sheet. The door to the room swings closed, as lightning flashes and the rain pours down on nighttime Darwin.",
    "1070": "As the boys run pell-mell into the water, the Japanese soldiers advance past the Mission buildings. The refugees pick their way through the ruins of the Mission's wooden jetty while the Japanese are searching the buildings on the beach. He walks off, leaving Drover standing with the children. Magarri runs through the shallows with his rifle. The boys move out beyond the end of the burning jetty and start to swim, using a piece of driftwood as a float. The Japanese run down to the beach, following footprints down the beach. Magarri loads and hides behind one of the wharf's supports, gasping in fear as the soldiers approach. He takes aim. Drover and the boys arrive at the boat and climb the ladder as soldiers fire at Magarri, who shoots back. As Magarri reloads, he looks across at Drover and the boys climbing onto the boat, then looks round at the soldiers getting closer. He drops his rifle and sprints up the beach to distract the Japanese. Drover gasps as Magarri, hit in the back, falls to the sand. He and the boys stare helplessly as the soldiers run up to the wounded man. The soldiers raise their rifles and an officer cocks his pistol. Magarri looks towards the boat. Drover and the boys watch as the soldiers move away from the body. The sail is raised and Ivan gets slowly to his feet. Flames roar into the air and King George, watching the soldiers work in the ruin, rubs dye into his cheeks. The soldiers move slowly through the flaming, smoking ruins of Darwin. Hoses spray water on the fires. Captain Dutton gets out of the truck. In her wrecked room over the pub, Sarah looks at a photograph of her, Nullah, and Drover. She looks tearfully down at Dutton issuing orders on the wharf. His eyes fill with tears of self-pity. Bomb ships burn in the bay. Dutton comes up to Sarah's room. Eyes closed, tears roll down her cheeks. The boys' boat sails into Darwin, past a huge burning ship. Men clamber into trucks, ready to evacuate south. Sarah tearfully watches the evacuation. A black soldier stands stripped to the waist, watching the trucks. Sarah looks at the ruins of the Territory Hotel and sighs. As she climbs into the truck, the small boat sails into view by the wharf. King George is up on the wreck of the Carney Cattle Company water tower. Nullah reaches into his pocket and pulls out Flynn's harmonica. Sarah hesitates by the truck, listening. Shocked, she turns to Dutton. Drover strokes the lad's hair as he plays. The priest conducts the choir. Drover stands at the stern of the boat.",
    "1071": "She runs down the peer as the boat draws alongside. Nullah and Sarah peer through the smoke. The boy stands up on the prow of the boat and grins. He jumps up and down excitedly and runs off the boat onto the jetty. He runs up the wooden steps to the upper level of the wharf and sprints through the smoke towards Sarah. Nullah points and she turns slowly. There in the smoke stands the Drover. Their eyes meet and they walk slowly towards one another. Drover frowns in disbelief, then smiles and they embrace. They cling to each other tears running down their cheeks. They break apart and look joyfully at one another, then kiss. Nullah runs up and hugs them both. Drover grins happily. The army sergeant sounds the horn of his truck and smiles. Dutton stops and stares at Sarah, Drover and the boys. He's taken aback by her hug. The sergeant stomps up to the young priest. Fletcher grimly watches the boys, streaming towards the trucks. Sarah rests her head on Drover's shoulder and caresses his cheek. Dutton turns to them. Dutton smiles tearfully. He nods and walks away. Fletcher strides angrily towards the truck the boys are getting into. Dutton's the last on. The tailgate is raised and the trucks head off. Fletcher runs through the devastation, watched from the water tower by King George. Sarah's walking with Nullah. King George looks in horror, as Fletcher grabs Bull's rifle. King George raises his arms in his magic-man stance, as Fletcher advances with the rifle. King George watches Fletcher closely. Sarah smiles, as Nullah runs towards the pub. Fletcher stands on top of a pile of wreckage and aims the rifle. Sarah spots the danger and, at the pub, Drover sees Fletcher. Drover runs for the boy. King George pulls a pipe off the water tower. Fletcher grimaces and Drover falls to the ground with Nullah. King George's pipe has run Fletcher through like a spear. King George glares at him. Drover strokes his hair. The unconscious boy's eyes flicker. Nullah grins. Fletcher tries to aim the rifle at King George. Fletcher winces and drops the rifle. Sarah reaches Drover and Nullah. Fletcher tries to speak and then collapses over a piece of wreckage. Sarah cuddles Nullah. Sergeant Callahan checks Fletcher's pulse. Sarah and Drover gaze into each other's eyes. They kiss, tenderly. Callahan walks away from Fletcher's body, across the wrecked King Carney cattle pen. Smoke hangs in palls over the destruction of Darwin. Drover drives the car in the sunshine, with Sarah and Nullah asleep next to him. Sarah picks up kindling for a fire in a field next to a river. She straightens and stares.",
    "1074": "Flynn is drinking rum and hides the bottle behind a Bible. He stands sheepishly with his hands in his pockets while she looks at a loss and downs her tea cup of rum in one gulp. A herd of horses is rounded up and they thunder past the house. Sarah looks out the door in amazement and stares straight into the eyes of the Drover, who is galloping alongside the herd. Flynn laughs in delight and Nullah leaps for joy as Sarah runs along the verandah watching the spectacle. The Drover reins in his horse, stares at Sarah, and takes off again. Once all the horses are rounded up, she runs indignantly after him and gets off her knees to look him right in the eye. He considers the sleek black thoroughbred leaping in its enclosure, eyes her, and walks off. She, dressed for the English countryside, trots off in a huff as they start to ride around the cattle, moving them into a single herd. She gallops after a lone steer. Back at the house, her luggage is being packed. The sun beats down on the homestead and the windmill turns slowly as Nullah and Daisy carry items of luggage for Sarah. A truck approaches and Nullah spots it, his eyes widening. He frantically climbs to the water tank as Sing Song grabs the dropped bags. Sarah watches from indoors. Daisy climbs with her son and they hide around the back of the tank. Daisy is about to get in with the boy but has to duck down and stay on the ladder to avoid being seen as the truck comes to a halt. Sarah pulls back the curtain and looks out at the cops. As the men look the other way, Daisy hurriedly climbs in after Nullah. She takes the tea tray to her. One man walks slowly towards the tank and Daisy clings in fear to the ladder inside the tank as the cop turns the water on in the pump. More water floods in the tank. Daisy holds her hand up for Nullah to grab. The tracker crouches. Daisy and Nullah cling frantically to the ladder but it collapses and they fall into the water. Daisy lifts Nullah to grab on to a pipe and she gets a grip too. The bar breaks and more water floods in. The sergeant looks out at the water tower and the Aboriginal tracker looks up and sees water pouring out of holes at the top of the tower, but more continues to pour from the tower. Daisy puts her hand over Nullah's mouth. The tracker walks slowly away as the windmill turns faster. Daisy flounders and sinks beneath the surface.",
    "1075": "Nullah notices and drops in after her. She eyes him coldly. He studies her and smiles. The Drover rides up as they pull away. In the tank, Nullah brings Daisy to the surface. As the truck drives away down the dusty road, Drover hauls Daisy's body from the tank. Sarah sprints over. Nullah desperately hugs his mother. Drover hangs his head as Nullah clings to the body. Bandy runs out of the house. The cop's truck continues down the long, straight, dusty road, into the vast scrub lands of Faraway Downs. The windmill turns slowly at sunset. Sarah looks tearfully out towards Daisy's blazing funeral pyre. Smoke drifts from the top of a rocky summit nearby. Magarri signals to the hilltop. He waves to King George who starts to chant. The body is carried towards the fire. The old man looks down on the homestead from his hilltop. In the soft glow of dawn, Sarah steps out of the house as Drover sits down on the fence and lights a cigarette. She looks distraught. He frowns and she avoids his gaze. She walks to where Nullah is grieving. He's lying curled up on the ground on a mattress. She's completely at a loss. She crouches down next to him and lays newspapers from a pile out on the ground to kneel on. She kneels and thinks. The nearest front page has an advert for a film. He looks up and sees the smoke on the hilltop. She looks perplexed. He holds up his hand with a cloth tied around it. She's not sure how to proceed. He watches her expectantly. She finishes with a self-deprecating flourish. Her eyes fill with tears. In the blazing sun, Sarah faces Drover in the saddle. Nullah looks up and a twister starts to form in the dust in front of the house. He looks unconvinced. Flynn salutes. He eyeballs Sarah. Bandy and Flynn nod. Sing Song winks. Nullah grins. Sing Song's chop wagon moves on as Drover opens the gate to the cattle pen. Drover marshals his motley gang of riders as the huge herd moves out of the pen, raising a massive cloud of dust. The army of cattle moves off. King George follows their progress from his rocky mountain top. The herd approaches a wide river. Drover and Sarah ride ahead of the cattle. The others ride behind and alongside, keeping them together. Sing Song drives his wagon into the water. The crossing's successful. Crowds fill an open-air cinema in nighttime Darwin. Carney stares grimly. He drops a curtain down between himself and Fletcher, who turns angrily away. The drive moves on through the soft light of sunset. They approach a range of jagged vertical cliffs.",
    "108": "Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens. Some of the Alabama policemen and citizens clap their hands as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd. Two black students are being led toward the schoolhouse. The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground. He steps out from the crowd and picks up the book, then brings it up to the girl. A coach looks at the television, which reveals Forrest as he stands at the schoolhouse door. He looks around, then waves. An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other coaches. The football coach and two assistant coaches look. Forrest dries himself off with a towel as he steps from the showers. COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace lies wounded on the ground. Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A white woman with a baby sits left. A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The black woman looks down at her watch. She gets up and steps over to the bus. The white woman sits closer to Forrest. Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain. A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people inside the car begin to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable. Billy gets back into the car. Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest. Forrest holds out the box of chocolates. Jenny grabs Forrest's hand and leads him toward the dorm. They sneak to Jenny's door. Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside. She pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed and hands it to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed. Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. She dries the water from her hair, then takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him. She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before. He looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that he is looking at her. She leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder. A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest. She laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.",
    "1082": "Asael covers up the potato stash with some sacking and climbs out of the hole. In one of the huts, Layla sits huddled at a table. Shimon and Malbin are trying to keep a chess game going on their knees. Weaver, the nurse, is rubbing ointment onto a man's frost-bitten toes. Rachel is sitting with her grandfather. Lazar addresses those present. In his cabin, Tuvia knocks back some vodka and stares grimly ahead. Later in the snowy woodland, he comes into a clearing holding his horse by its bridle. He strokes its white muzzle and with a deep sigh takes his revolver out of its holster. Malbin, hurrying through the snow with an armful of kindling, stops in his tracks. Arkady insists on a bigger portion than the rest. Morosely, Tuvia watches the people elbowing each other out of the way and walks past Malbin without acknowledging him. Elsewhere in the forest, commander Panchenko and Gramov ride ahead of the column of soldiers who are walking behind them. At their base camp, Zus gulps back some vodka and passes the bottle to Panchenko, who drains it and tosses it over his shoulder. Zus looks across at Viktor Panchenko. Zus's face turns to the side. At the camp, Tuvia, in his heavy gray coat and hat, machine gun over his shoulder, steps into a dark cabin where Lilka is sitting by a stove. He puts the gun down and whips off his hat. He throws a small log into the stove. He smiles at her as he rubs his hands. His cheeks tense. He drapes his coat around her shoulders, and she thanks him with a nod. Reaching into his trouser pocket, he brings out his revolver. He flashes her a brief smile, and she goes. From outside the door, Arkady leers in at him. Lazar is with a wounded man. Tuvia sees Lilka setting off to find food. Lilka, wrapped up in Tuvia's coat and her shawl over her head, with a bag over her shoulder, goes off into the wintry forest. Lilka wanders into a frosty dell. There are animal tracks in the snow ahead of her, and through the mist she sees an Alsatian staring back at her. She starts to retreat. The hound bounds towards her. She turns and runs. He leaps on her back, knocking her down. She leans up against a tree and watches in terror as it tears at the food sack with its sharp teeth. She stretches out her hand to reach the sack. The dog bares its teeth. It leaps up, and they both fall to the ground. She raises her head. In her hand, she's holding the gun. She walks back to camp with the dead dog slung across her shoulders.",
    "1085": "Malbin hurries up to meet him. Handing Malbin the gun, Tuvia runs off to investigate. He whips back a curtain across the door of a cabin. Lilka, Bella and Riva are with Tamara and her baby. He strides away. Tuvia gazes at Lilka and his face softens. She plants a kiss on his lips. He looks at her in mute surprise. She stands in front of him unflinching. Slowly he moves his mouth towards hers lightly brushing her lips. They kiss more fully. He smiles and their lips meet again. Beyond some trees, a German truck full of soldiers drives across a metal bridge followed by a car. Aron, hiding behind a tree, watches faithfully. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are hunched over their chess set. A message bag, a German courier. People crowd round the blond headed German. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek, then sits down at the table and opens the courier's leather case. He hands a document to Shimon. Malbin watches anxiously as people's anger turns to violence. Tuvia has his back turned as a bearded Jew spits on a man, and Shelman, the man who brought him, kicks him in the back. Tuvia and Shimon hurry over. Tuvia remains at a distance watching the mob take over. The German is felled. Aaron, his cheek swollen, turns away. Bella viciously slams the man with her rifle butt. Tuvia glances at Asael and walks off. Shimon and Malbin wincing, watch the mob savagely beat the man to death. With eyes dulled and a numbed expression. Tuvia comes across Aron sitting hunched on a mossy bank. His rifle on his lap, a hand to his mouth. Tuvia leans against a tree and watches his young brother's distress. Asael observes from a distance. At night, a guard patrols the camp. In his cabin, bathed in golden lamplight, Tuvia is sitting up in bed bare-chested with Lilka lying against him, covered by a blanket. He pulls her close to him and they settle down to sleep. Early one morning, at the army camp, Zus strides into Viktor's tent. Viktor turns to Zus. Zus turns to leave the commander's hut. Zus strides past Lova. Zus glancing at a German plane crossing the sky. At the camp Tuvia and Malbin see it too. People pack up their belongings. Guns and grenades loaded into Baskets and bags. Tuvia peers up to the sky at a plane changing direction. He dives towards Aron as the bomber passes overhead. People run in all directions as bombs explode around them. Many are hit. Tuvia and Lilka herd women and children through the smoke and flame towards the largest bunker. A woman is hit. More and more people are bundled into the shelter.",
    "1086": "Tuvia, weaving his way between the trees, is knocked off his feet by an exploding shell. As he groggily struggles to raise his head, his blue eyes seem dazed. Behind him, a bunker explodes, throwing bodies in all directions in a cascade of debris. In slow motion, a man runs through the trees amid the dust and flames. Tuvia, clutching a slender tree branch, his body position dazed, watches a bomber fly across the sky about to drop another bomb. Malbin appears out of the haze, pulls him towards a shelter. Asael arrives at the same moment. Tuvia slaps down against the wall of the bunker. The planes are flying away. Asael breaks from Tuvia. Malbin herds people out of the bunker. The survivors run through the trees, some carrying bundles, others armed with rifles. Chaya clings desperately to Asael. He and Tuvia take up gun positions behind a bunker. Asael glances sideways and sees Chaya positioning her rifle. He watches his young wife being urged away. His nose bleeding, Tuvia walks away from the burning remains of the camp, leaving a few men and women standing behind the mossy roots of their bunkers with weapons poised, keeping their sights fixed on the woodland ahead of them. Among them, Lazar, Lilka, and Asael. Deeper in the forest, the rest of the community hurry through the bare trees. The shooters leaning on the roofs of the shelters scan the horizon. One of the women is hit. Asael fires at the unseen enemy. Tuvia stops to listen to the sound of gunfire. Another man is down. Asael keeping his head low scurries to a new position. A machine gunner falls to the ground. Lazar runs on. The others give him cover. Asael scrambles sideways, firing as he runs. The bunker behind him is blown to smithereens. Asael pulls an injured woman, Layla, to safety. Lazar with rifle in hand, ducks behind a tree. Lazar reloads. Seeing Asael crawling towards him with Layla hurt, he propels himself out from behind the tree and runs towards the enemy. His body is tossed into the air like a rag doll. Asael looks behind him and sees a female shooter hit, her arm still clinging to her machine gun. Her head goes limp, but the gun goes on firing. Deeper in the misty forest, Tuvia at the head of his flock, faced as he strides on, a machine gun is held across his body. Further on, with Malbin, Bella, and Shulman behind him, he comes into a clearing. But his pale blue eyes scan the horizon. Stretching ahead of them with no end in sight is marshland. Aron and Rachel, Tamara cuddling her baby look up at the sky.",
    "1089": "Aron, sitting with his legs drawn up in front of him, slowly gets up to his feet, and throws the cloth bundle over his shoulder. Dark green conifers stretch as far as the eye can see. A man strides through the undergrowth and comes across Asael lying asleep by a tree with Aron in his arms. The stone-faced man in his late thirties, in a cloth cap and a brown leather jacket over heavy wool trousers, picks up a stone and tosses it onto the ground. Asael wakes up. He gets to his feet. Tuvia grabs him roughly. The two brothers hug fiercely. Tuvia beckons to their youngest brother, and all three stand locked in a hug. Zus appears carrying kindling. Tuvia nods bitterly as Zus fishes in his pocket, and brings out the mezuzah. He tosses it to Tuvia, then drops the kindling to the ground. As Zus starts snapping the twigs, Tuvia glances at the Hebrew markings on the mezuzah, and hugs Aron even more tightly. Zus hands Tuvia some vodka. The four of them huddle together in the pouring rain. Aron sits with a coat on his head listening quietly. They have a little fire near to a stream. Tuvia crouches down next to Zus who is the tallest of the three adults. Elsewhere in the forest ants scurry over a mound of twigs. Aron pushes a stick into the mud with a curious expression and watches several ants climb onto it. He brings the stick closer to him and studies their movements. He reels around and spots a female figure running through the trees some distance away. He gets to his feet and starts to run after her. He stops between two silver birch trees and watches the teen girl run towards a gray bearded man in a Homburg hat, shirt and waistcoat and suit trousers sitting on a log with a little girl in his arms. Aron looks in another direction and sees a young man accompanying an old woman. From behind more trees, a man in a black hat and black overcoat with a smartly dressed woman in a stylish bearing. Clutching his stick, Aron steps towards a mud ditch in the middle of a clearing. The long winding ditch is full of dead bodies piled on top of each other. Aron's eyes fill with horror. His brothers are sitting around the fire. Zus and Tuvia look at each other. Aron has brought the old man and the child. Tuvia lays the child down near the fire. Zus armed with a rifle watches the other people arrive. He and Tuvia glance at each other in mute surprise. The old man weeps and strokes the little girl's glossy dark hair.",
    "1091": "At night in pouring rain, Tuvia stands staring at a cottage in the clearing, his lips pursed, with the collar of his jacket pulled up. Inside, Berniscki, his wife, and two sons are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room. Berniscki jumps up, Tuvia draws the gun, Berniscki shrugs lamely, and cowering, sinks to his knees. One son stands up, Tuvia dispatches both sons then Berniscki, and then Berniscki dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse as she mourns before him, her hands splattered with blood. He goes, stumbling through the dark forest and makes his escape. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the sleeping people all around him. Picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small fire. Tuvia is sitting broodily staring into space. Zus hands his brother the bottle, Tuvia takes a slug, and Zus examines the revolver, counting the number of bullets. A fleeting smile passes between them, Zus hands back the gun. Sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look. Later, two men are sawing a log, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter, Zus hammers a beam, Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding narrowly missing Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia, Zus frowns, the girl with a beret, Lazar, and Laila walk off, everyone looks around. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle. Zus puts his hands up, the brothers stiffen, Zus eyes them steadily. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth, he throws up by a tree and sinks to his knees. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk, Tuvia grabs him from behind and wrestles him to the ground, blood seeps from the wound on Zus' head, he frees himself from his brother's grasp. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael. Tuvia runs off to Zus, Tuvia looks at Asael who averts his gaze and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky. Zus shoots the man, shouts, an elderly Russian runs out to his blazing truck, Zus dispatches him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck. A pin prick of light punctures the darkness. Peretz running along a dirt track joins the others hiding in a ditch.",
    "1094": "Bella walks up to Zus who is sitting on a log. Her dark hair cut short and wearing a grey wool coat, she sits down on the log. They exchange a brief smile. Zus offers her a sip from his hip flask. She meets his playful expression with a shrug, and then a smile. She takes the flask and drinks from it. He looks, then lowers his eyes. His dark eyes hold her in his gaze, and she nods faintly. This time, she looks Zus straight in the eye. Tentatively, he raises his hand and touches her cheek with his fingers, gently pulling at her bottom lip with his thumb. She takes hold of his hand with her hand and places it on her right breast, discretely covering his hand with a coat and holding his gaze. Elsewhere, Aron and his friend, Rachel, tramp through the spindly birch trees. In the distance, they spot Kissely the milkman running ahead of a unit of armed men in black uniforms. The two youngsters dive behind a rock. Zus and Tuvia, their guns up and ready, urge the men and women to flee. Benzion in a fur hat leads them across a shallow stream. Kissely and the policemen with guns arrive at the camp. One of the Bielski group carries a goat across the stream. A woman stumbles and falls into the water. Zus helps her up. Carrying bags and baskets, the people scramble up a slope. Tuvia and other men with guns scoot back down the hill to take up positions behind trees. The Russian policemen and helmeted soldiers come into view below them. Zus, Tuvia, and the others fire. One wounded soldier is helped away from the stream. The bearded milkman cowers behind a tree. Zus stops to reload. The policeman looks back at his half a dozen men. Zus hits the milkman's arm. Tuvia unleashes a salvo of bullets. The policeman skulking behind a tree calls to his men to go. Tuvia watches them retreating through the trees. He and the others stride forward in a line. Zus reloads. Tuvia's cheeks tighten as he ponders his brother's words, but he runs off after the others. The displaced community of men, women, and children clutching their bundles of possessions. Some in hats and coats. Others in flat caps and jackets. Many of the women with shawls on their heads tramp through the forest, dwarfed by the tall, thin, bare trees. They come out onto a meadow of tall grasses wafting in the breeze. Walking almost in single file, like black shadows moving across the landscape. Tuvia and Ben Zion, behind them Zus with Bella by his side, lead the way out of the wood.",
    "1096": "Zus holds a protective hand in front of his face as people watch in mute shock. Tuvia, with a livid scowl, drops the stone on the ground and gets to his feet. Zus sits up, wipes his mouth, and straightens his jacket, looking around at the assembled people staring at him. Benzion picks up his gun. Zus addresses Asael, who's standing with Chaya. The two young people look at each other, and Zus looks at them both, affectionately patting Asael on the cheek. He turns to find Bella standing behind him. Without a word, he grabs his machine gun, and with a line of volunteers behind, strides off past Tuvia. At Nowogrodek, Nazi soldiers stand guard as Jewish men and women wearing yellow stars file into the ghetto. Tuvia and Asael stride purposefully past the ghetto entrance, carefully tread along a low-tiled roof, climb down at the far end, and hurry towards the ghetto's interior. On an unpaved woodland track, the army general Panchenko, astride a tall black horse with Gramov at his side, rides at the head of an infantry column toward Zus and his men standing by the side of the track. Panchenko nods at Zus who nods back, and as the Russian commander moves on, Zus and his men fall in with the Russian foot soldiers. A Jewish elder at the ghetto addresses a room packed with smartly dressed, solemn-looking people. Tuvia addresses two women in the room and looks despairingly at Asael. A beautiful young woman steps forward. Under a cover of darkness, as the ghetto people stream out of a house tearing off their yellow stars, one Jewish man hiding in a doorway peers towards the floodlit square where German guards are on duty in front of the barb-wired entrance to the ghetto. He beckons to Asael across the dark narrow street where the people have gathered. Asael ushers them out through a hole in the wall and into the street, leaving behind a pile of yellow fabric stars. At daybreak, carrying bags and cases, they walk in single file across the wintry landscape towards a windmill and on into the Birchwood forest. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are sitting behind a makeshift desk on which people are putting their valuables. She and her parents hug each other. Shimon addresses an elderly man. Tuvia shows the man a loose trigger on a rifle. The watchmaker hands back the rifle and the trigger works. Tuvia on his horse speaks while young and old listen with rapt attention. Malbin nods approvingly. A curly-haired boy turns to Lilka, the beautiful newcomer. Asael supervises shooting practice. Elsewhere, women are sitting at sewing machines.",
    "1097": "Six silver interlocking V shapes of decreasing sizes. A hearse and several cars are parked outside a large Catholic church. A balding man plays the organ. A small congregation sits in pews towards the front of the grand church. An older man, Al, gets up from his pew and walks past a coffin draped in a white sheet. Al walks up to him. On a table in front of the coffin is a photograph of an attractive middle-aged woman. Standing beside the coffin is a tall hard-faced elderly man, Walt Kowalski. Al shakes Walt's hand and goes back to his pew. Four casually-dressed teenage kids -- Daniel, David, Ashley and Josh -- walk up the aisle. They each kneel and make the sign of the cross. Ashley, a pretty girl with red hair, wears a short top exposing her pierced belly button. Seeing this, Walt grimaces. Josh, a thin boy with fair hair, is last to kneel, bow, and make the sign of the cross. Walt watches the kids, tight-lipped, eyes narrowed. His middle-aged sons, Mitch and Steve, turn to each other. Walt stands motionless like a stone statue. Mitch gives Steve a withering look. Mitch's wife Karen shushes them. Walt looks down weary. He has thin gray hair combed to one side. A young priest, wearing a flowing white surplice, steps up to his lectern beside the altar. Ashley sits texting on her cell phone. The Stars and Stripes flies on a pole outside Walt's modest clapboard house. Inside, the mourners help themselves to food. In the basement, Daniel, David, and Josh open a trunk and look at some war photographs. Steve follows Walt, who wears a permanent frown. Walt heads down to the basement. Tubby, 40-something Steve looks put out. Hearing Walt come down, the boys quickly shut the trunk, rush over to a couch, and sit down. Ignoring them, Walt picks up two metal folding chairs and goes back upstairs. Sitting holding her cell phone, Ashley looks at her mother Karen. Ashley goes over to Walt, who's unfolding the chairs. Ashley rolls her eyes and looks at Karen, who beckons her over. Ashley trudges back to her seat. Walt walks out of the front door with his Golden Labrador. He opens a pouch of chewing tobacco as he goes down the front steps and watches people go into the house next door. Walt pops some tobacco in his mouth and stares at the house, eyes narrowed. He spits and wanders away. Ashley's in the large garage, smoking. Beside her, with its cover partially pulled back, is a pristine Ford Gran Torino muscle car. Walt pulls open the garage door and sunlight floods in. Ashley drops the cigarette and blows out smoke.",
    "110": "A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down. Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief. Bubba and Forrest shake hands. Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room and sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. Bubba's grandmother does the same. The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man. The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest. Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits are still working on theirs. The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest, looks at his stop watch, and walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble his rifle. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in his slow southern drawl. Bubba and Forrest shine their boots and scrub the floor with toothbrushes on their hands and knees. Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly. Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up. A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest. Forrest picks up the magazine and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all. Forrest looks up with shock and cranes his head up for a closer look. Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the club. The EMCEE steps out onto the stage. The men laugh. Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down, then tosses his drink on her. Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest shoves him down too. Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar and all, and carries her. Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest and walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her. Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club. Jenny turns and looks over the bridge, then looks at the light of an approaching vehicle and steps into the street. She runs and flags down the approaching vehicle. A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver. Jenny walks toward Forrest and looks at the driver. Jenny walks up to Forrest and takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the truck.",
    "1100": "The gang drives up, and Thao eyes them suspiciously as five mean-looking Hmong guys get out. Spider walks over to Thao and ruffles his hair, while Sue goes inside. Thao takes off his gardening gloves and stands with Spider and Smokie, looking next door before following them. The gang spots Walt's car as Walt is in a bar with his buddies. They leave the others at the bar, and Walt makes to drink his whiskey but stops short before downing his shot in one. Father J nods. A noise wakes Walt from his slumbers. He looks out of the window and sees torchlight in his garage, gets up, and goes over to a chest. He opens it and pulls out an old military rifle, opening the breech and loading a magazine into it, then cocking it. Rifle in hand, Walt edges the garage door open and walks inside. He sees Thao with a torch beside the Gran Torino. As Walt advances, the barrel of the rifle knocks the overhead light, sending it swinging. By its drunken swaying light, he aims the rifle at Thao, who backs away. Thao stumbles and falls backward, tripping Walt in the process. The rifle goes off, shooting a sign on the wall. Thao runs out of the garage, leaving Walt sprawling on the ground. He runs to Spider's souped-up Honda in the street. Walt spits out some blood and pushes himself up. Mitch makes a phone call in his kitchen. Walt is in his garage installing window grills and hangs up. Mitch looks put-out. In his driveway, Walt lovingly polishes his Gran Torino. It's dark green with gold trims. He buffs a wing of the car and works his way around to the bonnet, carefully removing any marks. Evening, Walt sits on his porch with his dog Daisy and lights a cigarette, he looks out at Gran Torino parked on the drive. A couple of people walk by on the street. Walt swigs from a can of beer. As the light begins to fade and several beers later, he gets to his feet. He calls to his dog as he heads inside. He switches on the porch light as he goes into the house and shuts the door behind him. Night, Spider's Honda pulls up on the street outside Thao's house. Spider and his cronies get out. They approach Thao and his sister Sue sitting on the porch. Spider tousles Thao's hair. Spider hustles Thao towards the car. Family members intervene and a scuffle breaks out. The scuffle spills over onto Walt's lush green lawn and two garden gnomes are broken. Rifle in hand, Walt marches onto the lawn. He aims his gun at the squabbling guys.",
    "1101": "They straighten up. As Smokie stares down the rifle's barrel, he reconsiders. Spider lets go of Thao, and he and his buddies retreat to his car. Walt keeps the gun trained on them as they go. Thao rejoins his family. Walt heads back into his house. Sue, Thao and the others go back to theirs. Walt is at the kitchen sink. Hearing something, he picks his rifle up from beside his cooker, and goes out on to the porch to investigate. He looks surprised to find some of his neighbors laying gifts of food and flowers on his front steps. The Hmongs leave. Walt stares at the platters of food with distaste. He puts them all in the trash. He sees more of his neighbors approaching with gifts. He intercepts Sue and Thao. He looks sheepishly at Walt. Walt marches back to his house. Sue, her mother and Thao get back to theirs. Sue turns back to look at Walt. Father Janovich finds Walt sitting on his porch, smoking his cigarette. Walt gets up. Father Janovich nods slightly. Walt is at the barber's. Sue is with a white boy, Trey. They approach three black youths. As the black guys hassle Sue and Trey. Walt pulls up at the junction in his pickup. Walt watches thoughtfully. Looking uneasy, Walt drives across the junction. Walt pulls up beside them. The black guys notice Walt. Walt steps out of his pickup. Chewing on a plug of tobacco, he squares up to the three black guys. He spits. Walt points his finger like a gun. He cocks his thumb. The guys hold Sue back. Walt pulls a Colt .45 pistol. Trey hurries off and Walt puts his gun away. He turns to the black guys. He turns back to his pickup. Walt looks menacingly back at them. He gets in the truck with Sue in the passenger seat. Walt drives off in a leisurely, unhurried fashion. Walt nods thoughtfully. Walt sits down on his porch with a newspaper. He sees the elderly grandma from next door looking over at him. He picks up his glasses and puts them on to read the paper. He looks down at Daisy. Disgruntled, he looks across the street at a white woman unloading groceries from her car. She drops them. Three passing Hmong youths make no attempt to help her. One of them mimes shagging her. He sits back down as Thao helps the woman. Walt puts his glasses down, and picks up a mug. He takes a drink. Walt looks over at the old lady next door and she gives him a nod. With big buttons. Cigarettes. Walt looks furious. Walt puts away a photo of his wife.",
    "1102": "Sitting on his porch, he looks over at the road where Sue helps two other women get out of a car. She walks over towards him as he sips from a beer can. He's tempted. They go next door. Walt opens the well-stocked fridge. He pats a child's head. Everyone gives him disapproving looks. Sue steers him away. At a buffet table, he looks at the buffet. Sue brings Walt another beer and finds him staring at the elder in ceremonial dress sitting across the room. The old man stares back. She goes over to Kor Khue. They go over to Walt. Walt sits down in a chair, and Kor Khue studies his craggy features. Walt looks thoughtful. Troubled Walt looks up at the diminutive Kor Khue, who nods. Walt gets to his feet and walks across the room. He looks into the next room, where some women are having tea. Sue watches him as he begins to cough. He coughed up blood onto the back of his hand. He quickly conceals it from Sue and hurries away upstairs. She follows him. Walt disappears into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He rinses his face in the basin and regards his reflection in the mirror. He dries his face. He opens the bathroom door. As he sits at the table, women fuss around him and load his plate with food. Sue wanders into the kitchen and finds him tucking in. Very reluctantly he gets up. Sue leads Walt down into the basement, where the younger generations of Hmongs have gathered. Walt looks singularly unimpressed. Sue smiles and goes towards Thao, who sits alone, away from the others. Walt leans against a tumble dryer. It rocks under his weight. He puts his beer down and fiddles about underneath the tumble dryer, adjusting its legs to stabilize it. Some of the youngsters look over at him, on his hands and knees. He notices them looking. He gets back up, pats the drier and leans against it for a moment. Satisfied it's OK, he begins to wander across the basement. He eyes an attractive Hmong girl who's sitting with some boys. Walt notices she keeps glancing over at Thao. Walt drinks from a beer bottle and walks over to Sue who offers him a glass of clear liquid. He takes a sip and Sue wanders off. Walt puts his beer down and looks back over at the girl sitting with the boys. Walt glances over at Thao sitting on his own, looking miserable. She keeps looking at Thao. The girl gets up and walks up behind Walt. He turns around and sees her. She wanders off and he stares after her.",
    "1104": "Karen hands him the phone. Reluctantly, Mitch answers it. As Mitch hangs up, he looks troubled. Walt stares into the distance with a frown. He looks down at some hospital admission forms and test results. Day, Thao carries a bundle of garden waste out to the front of his house. Walt watches from his porch as Spider's car comes slowly down the street. Thao sees it and goes back into the garden. Walt lights a cigarette, as the modified Honda cruises slowly by. Smokie stares out of the car, and Walt mimes shooting him. Smokie responds by giving him the finger. Thao watches the exchange of gestures. Later Walt opens his front door to Thao. Walt's working under the sink in Thao's kitchen. The ceiling fan gyrates unsteadily. In his garage, Walt works on the fan with Thao. Thao folds his arms. Walt doubles up. Thao sees he's coughed up blood. Thao nods at the Gran Torino. Walt follows his gaze to the green V8 muscle car. Thao nods. Walt grins. Down in his basement, Walt is busy moving an old freezer on a sack truck. He attempts to get it up the stairs, but finds it hard going. He tugs away, then gives it up as a bad job. Thao opens his door to Walt. They go down to Walt's basement. They heave the freezer up the steps. They get it outside. Thao rubs his neck. Sue finds Walt on his back porch, as Thao washes the Gran Torino on the drive. She shrugs, then glances at Thao. She goes to get one. Walt looks over at Thao. Later, he watches Thao working in the garden. Walt gets a cigarette. The lighter. Thao and Walt get out of his pickup truck. They go in the barber shop. Thao goes out, and comes straight back in. A gun. Martin takes a seat. Thao comes back in. Walt and Thao drive up to a building site in Walt's old white Ford pickup. They park up. Work gloves. They leave Tim's portacabin, and Tim sits back down at his desk. Walt's pickup truck pulls up outside C.M. Young Hardware and Lumber Store. Walt and Thao get out. They go inside and look around. Walt makes his way over to a shelf, which has what he's looking for. A tape measure. A tool bag. Walt holds his hand out and Thao shakes it. As they head off, Walt winces slightly. Carrying his new stuff, Thao gets off a bus and jogs down a back alley heading home. As he trots along, he sees Spider's Honda coming the other way. The car pulls up, and Spider and his four cronies get out. Smokie stubs a cigarette out on Thao's cheek.",
    "1107": "An evening sky, the clouds are tinged red by the setting sun. The sun slowly sinks below the horizon. In the sprawling suburbs, the streets grow dark and the lights go on in the rows of houses. A light shines from an upstairs window. In the bedroom, a dark-haired boy wearing round glasses is looking at an unusual photo album.He turns a page. The people in the photographs are moving. They smile at him. He turns to a snowy owl in a padlocked cage. Harry pulls a face. In the kitchen, his Aunt Petunia is decorating a meringue gateau. Uncle Vernon is fastening his son's bow tie. Dudley scowls at Harry knocking into him as he passes. The three of them stare ominously at Harry. Harry goes upstairs as the guests arrive. He finds a small wizened creature with floppy ears and a long pointed nose jumping on his bed. The creature is wearing a filthy rag. Banging his head. Harry's bedroom. Dobby grabs a lamp and hits himself. Uncle Vernon hears the noise upstairs. Vernon leaves. He opens the wardrobe. Dobby has a bundle of letters. Harry chases him downstairs. Dobby stops at the kitchen door. On the table, stands the huge meringue gateau decorated with green and mauve whipped cream and red cherries. Dobby clicks his fingers. The gateau rises into the air. He clicks his finger again. The gateau floats out of the kitchen. Horrified, Harry follows it into the sitting room. The creamy desert hovers over Mrs. Mason. Dobby clicks his fingers. The gateau falls on her head. Mrs. Mason is covered in cake and cream. Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Vernon fixes bars outside Harry's window. Asleep in bed Harry suddenly wakes. Looking puzzled he reaches out for his glasses and puts them on. Getting out of bed, he goes across to the window and stares through the bars at the dark night sky. A faint light appears far away above the roof tops gradually getting nearer. To Harry's surprise, the light becomes two headlights. A blue Ford Anglia with a white roof flies down over the neighboring gardens and hovers outside Harry's window. The lights disturb the snowy owl. Harry stares at the three red head boys in the car. Dressing quickly, Harry packs his trunk. Ron fixes a hook to the bars on the window. The bars on window frame are wrenched away. The Dursleys wake. The car boot flies open and Harry pushes his luggage out into it. Vernon unlocks the padlocks on Harry's door. Harry passes Hedwig's cage to Ron. Harry dives for the window but Vernon grabs his foot. The car zooms away. Vernon falls head first out of the window.",
    "1110": "A spider, bigger than a man's hand, jumps out of the box and scuttles past Harry and off down the corridor. Harry stretches out his hand, and a wind seems to draw him away. The door slams shut. Back on Harry's desk, the book opens and glows with light. Harry lands back in his chair. In the school courtyard, they look at each other guiltily. As Hagrid walks towards the school, a boy rushes out past him. They all run to the boys' dormitory and stop in the doorway. The floor is covered with scattered books and papers, broken picture frames and feathers. The mattress and pillows of Harry's four-poster bed have been slashed. Drawers have been emptied out. Hedwig the Snowy Owl sits on the desk as Harry searches through a pile of books on the floor. The Gryffindor team heads for the pitch. In the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey is standing next to a bed where a petrified girl is lying. Harry and Ron stare with horror at the stiff figure. A hand mirror shows Hermione's eyes wide open and staring. Harry gently strokes her outstretched hand. In the Gryffindor common room, she sweeps out. Concerned, the students look at each other. Harry turns to Ron. In Hagrid's cottage at the edge of the dark forest, his dog Fang raises his head. Hagrid picks up his crossbow and kicks open the door. They take off the cloak. His hand shakes as he pours it out. Ron and Harry hide under the invisibility cloak. Lucius Malfoy opens the door and steps inside. He stops near the boys under the cloak. Fudge goes to take it but Dumbledore stops him. Dumbledore takes the scroll and stares straight at Harry and Ron. Lucius Malfoy looks around suspiciously. He crosses to the door. Giving the boys one last look, Dumbledore follows him. Fudge looks confused and stares at the huge dog. They leave. The boys reappear. Lines of spiders are following each other up the wall and out of the window. Harry lifts down heavy lantern. The huge hound follows them outside. They look up at the light from the cottage window. The spiders are crawling down the wall and on to go the ground. Ron watches the spiders nervously as they scuttle after each other away into the forest. Harry starts walking. Ron follows Harry reluctantly. Fang drops ahead as they make their way through the dark night into the gloomy forest. Fang sniffs the ground. They are led deeper into the shadowy forest. Terrified of spiders, Ron walks on his toes trying not to trade on them. Harry ignores him and keeps on walking. Harry stops and holds up the lantern. The spiders have led them to the mouth of a large tunnel dug into the sandy soil under the roots of a tree.",
    "1112": "The car steadies itself and flies high over the tops of the tall trees, zooming over the forest before landing heavily on the grass beside Hagrid's cottage. They stagger out of the car, which then starts itself, reverses, changes direction, and drives away past Hagrid's cottage, disappearing into the trees at the edge of the dark forest. The sun rises behind the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School. In the hospital wing, Harry puts some fresh flowers on the table by Hermione's bed and sits sadly beside their petrified friend with Ron. Harry gently strokes her hand and notices something clutched in her clenched fingers—a crumpled piece of paper, a page from a book. Harry looks puzzled for a moment, then spots his reflection in the window and reads from the page again. Harry and Ron hide in the second floor corridor where the teachers are gathering. Lockhart swaggers up, swallows nervously, and hurries away. Harry and Ron look horrified as the worried teachers leave. Ron reads out the message written in blood on the wall, and they run to Lockhart's room, finding him packing. Lockhart grabs his wand, but the boys point their wands at him, and he drops his. They all go to the girls' lavatory, where Myrtle spots the three of them coming in, points across the room, and floats away. Harry crosses to the ring of sinks set around the base of an ornate marble structure, looks up, runs his hand along the ledge above, and twists the tap. He notices a raised decoration on the side of it, a copper snake, and runs his finger over it. Lockhart looks aghast as Harry concentrates hard, speaks, and the heavy top of the structure rises into the air. The sinks around the base divide and move away from each other, and the sink decorated with the snake slowly disappears downwards. As it reaches the ground, a heavy metal grill slides over it, uncovering a deep shaft. Lockhart looks down into it, then backs away, but they grab him, and he almost falls down the shaft. Ron gives him a push, and Lockhart disappears down the shaft. Harry jumps, quickly followed by Ron. The shaft becomes a smooth pipe, and they slide down it, falling onto a floor covered with animal bones. They point their wands at Lockhart, who is covered in dirt. Ron notices the bones on the ground and makes Lockhart follow Harry through a huge pipe leading to a low cave where something scaly is lying on the ground. Lockhart faints, then leaping up, grabs Ron's wand.",
    "1113": "Lockhart flies upwards, hits the roof of the cave and falls. The cave roof starts to collapse. The passage between Ron and Harry is completely blocked. Harry peers through a tiny gap in the rocks. Lying on the ground, Lockhart smiles vacantly. He picks up a stone. Ron grabs the stone and hits him over the head with it. Harry climbs over fallen rocks. Holding his wand in his hand, he starts to explore the cave. On the wall ahead, he sees a circular hinged door decorated with a pattern of snakes. He goes towards it and starts to speak. One snake glides around the circumference, unlocking the mechanism. The heavy metal door swings open. Holding his wand as protection, Harry walks warily through the circular opening of the long and narrow tunnel. He climbs down the few rungs of a short metal ladder and jumps off at the bottom. He finds himself in a long, damp chamber. Ahead of him runs a wide paved path lined on either side by huge carved snake heads, their stone mouths gaping open. Harry walks towards the massive carved head of a bearded man illuminated with a green light. The head is reflected in the water beneath. He sees the still figure of a girl lying on the wet stone floor. He runs towards her and kneels beside her. Her face is pale and her eyes are closed. Harry looks around and sees Tom Riddle in the shadows. He picks up Harry's wand. Harry gets up and holds out his hand. He writes fiery letters in the air with Harry's wand. Harry stares at him. They glare angrily at each other. They both look up. The phoenix drops something into Harry's hand. The handsome bird swipes away down the chamber. Harry unrolls the crumpled sorting hat and looks at it in surprise. Riddle stretches out his hand. The mouth of the huge bearded statue starts to open. Harry watches in fascinated horror as the huge stone mouth opens wider and wider. A gigantic serpent slithers out. Harry drops the hat and runs. The serpent splashes through the water beneath the statue. It slithers ominously after Harry, who trips and falls. Harry cowers, protecting his head as the serpent prepares to strike. Fawkes suddenly reappears. The Phoenix flies at the serpent's head, flapping its wings, the brave bird pecks repeatedly at the other creature's huge yellow eyes. Riddle calls out angrily. Fawkes swoops off. Harry scrambles to his feet. He backs away as the serpent threshes his head. The serpent feels his footsteps and lunges forward. Harry makes a dash for it. He splashes through a shallow pool with the huge serpent's head after him.",
    "1116": "Vernon lands flat on his back in a bush. He scrambles to his feet and stares angrily after the car as it disappears into the night sky. From the back seat, Ron smiles at his friend. The suburbs are left far behind. As day breaks, the car reaches open countryside. It sweeps down over green fields and trees towards a ramshackle house beside a lake. The car touches down on a narrow sandy track and bumps along it past an outhouse. Two pale pink pigs look up curiously from their sty. Harry's eyes are wide with amazement. The three brothers unlock the door and creep stealthily into the house. Harry looks around the kitchen with delight. A pan scrubber cleans a frying pan which holds itself under a running tap. Ron grabs a bun. Next to an armchair, a pair of needles hang in mid-air knitting a multi-colored garment. A young girl. Embarrassed the girl disappears upstairs. Mr. Weasley joins them at the table. An old grey owl flaps wearily towards the house and hits the window. Percy takes an envelope from the owl's beak. Beside the fireplace. Wearing his school cloak, Ron steps into the fireplace and takes a handful of powder. Ron disappears in a flash of green flames. Harry steps forward nervously. Harry takes a handful of powder. Standing in the fireplace, Harry takes a deep breath. Harry disappears in a flash of green flames. Mrs. Weasley looks confused. Harry shoots out of the fireplace onto a dusty wooden floor. He is streaked with soot and ash. He picks up his glasses and puts them on. One of the lenses is broken. He gets up slowly and looks around the gloomy shop. At the glass cabinets covered in cobwebs. They are all piled high with shrunken heads and skulls of all shapes and sizes. Cautiously, he moves towards a shelf and taps idly on a glass dome. Beside it, a skeletal hand with bony black fingers is mounted on a piece of marble. Harry puts his fingers around the bony thumb. The hand suddenly closes, clutching him tightly. He struggles desperately to free himself from its ghastly grip. The hand releases him, and he hurries across the shop towards the open door which leads out into the alley. Outside, he finds himself in a damp, dingy passageway. He passes a suspicious looking man lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, a sharp faced witch with a pointed hat grabs him by the arm. He is surrounded. He is terrified. Harry runs towards Hagrid. A giant with bushy hair and a huge black beard. In Diagon Alley, a girl with long wavy hair comes out of a shop and spots them.",
    "1118": "It heads straight towards the ground. They both wrestle with the gear stick. Ron waves his wand desperately. It snaps. The car heads towards an ancient willow tree standing in the school grounds. It plunges onto the top branches. High in the tree, the car rocks precariously. It falls backwards, but gets stuck halfway down. Ron holds up his broken wand. Hefty willow branches attack the car. The vehicle rocks and the windscreen shatters. A branch smashes through the back window. Branches attack from all angles. They are showered with broken glass. The car suddenly tips forward, bounces from branch to branch, and falls towards the ground. It lands on the grass. Ron presses the accelerator and the car zooms away. The tree lunges after them, but they escape its clutching branches. Clear of the angry willow, the boys breathe a sigh of relief. Suddenly, the car doors fly open and they are hurled out onto the grass. The boot opens and throws out their trunks and luggage. Harry catches Hedwig's cage, and Ron peers anxiously at his pet rat. The car starts. The doors shut and the battered car drives itself across the grass towards a stone archway. Harry and Ron race after it. It rolls down a cobbled passageway and zooms away towards the forest, leaving Ron and Harry far behind. Later, they haul their luggage into school and leave it on the landing. They run upstairs. Filch, the caretaker, with his cat, Mrs. Norris, is standing at the top of the stairs. Hogwarts School is housed in a handsome castle surrounded by stone outbuildings and long Victorian greenhouses. In one of these, a class of students stand waiting around a long bench filled with rows of potted plants. A short, plump woman with curly, gray hair in a brown smock and a matching tall, pointed hat comes in. She's wearing a pair of earmuffs. The root looks like an ugly baby. They cover their ears. A boy collapses. They pull out the screaming roots. Showing off, Draco Malfoy pokes his finger into his Mandrake's mouth. It bites him. Furious, he throws it into a pot. Later, in the corridor. The ghost of Sir Nicolas floats into the Great Hall where the students are sitting at long tables. Ron is trying unsuccessfully to mend his broken wand with sticky tape. A boy takes a photograph. A tatty gray owl flies down into the room. Swooping low over the table, it heads for Ron, but collides with a bowl, scattering crisps everywhere. Draco and his cronies snigger. Ron takes a red envelope from Errol's beak. Ron nervously breaks the seal on the red envelope. To his embarrassment, it starts to scream at him.",
    "1121": "Chasing after Harry, the Bludger crashes through the towers, one by one. Harry swoops lower to the grass, but the Bludger follows him closely. Draco watches, a smug expression on his face. The Bludger crashes through another tower. Harry flies back over the arena to see Draco hovering in front of him. Harry suddenly sees the Golden Snitch beside Draco's head. They both duck as the Bludger hurtles past. Then Harry heads for the Snitch, closely followed by Draco who elbows him out of the way. Draco takes the lead. The Snitch disappears under the wooden scaffolding supporting the spectators' stands. Draco flies after it, closely followed by Harry who swerves to avoid a solid wooden beam. The Snitch is too fast for Draco's grasping fingers. Harry is still being chased by the heavy wooden Bludger. Determined to stay ahead, Draco grits his teeth. He looks around in dismay as Harry catches him up and gradually overtakes. Now, close behind Draco, the heavy Bludger crashes into the wooden beams. They weave over and under the wooden struts. Draco catches up again and bashes Harry in the ribs. They fly neck and neck, the Snitch just out of reach. They flash past Colin with his camera. He ducks. The Bludger flies over his head and smashes through a wooden support. Harry takes the lead again, the Bludger streaks past them both and weaves from side to side in front of them, smashing holes in the sides of the structure. Suddenly, it turns and hurtles back towards them. Draco's broomstick catches on a wooden strut. He somersaults into the air and lands heavily on the grass of the arena. Harry is still pursuing the Golden Snitch. As he stretches out his hand to grasp it, a rogue Bludger smashes into his arm. Wincing with pain, he grasps his broomstick between his knees. He stretches out his good hand and grabs the Snitch. Then he overbalances, falls off, and lands on his back on the soft sand beneath the goal post. His friends rush to join him. The Bludger hits the sand beside Harry. Hermione's spell works. The Bludger explodes in mid air. Everyone runs towards Harry. Lockhart pushes up Harry's sleeve. Ron and Hagrid look alarmed. Harry's arm goes completely limp and floppy. He folds the wrist back on its self. The hospital wing. He drinks some medicine. Late at night, Harry is lying fast asleep when a strange noise wakes him. He opens his eyes and sits up. He looks around, but the room seems empty. Harry puts on his glasses and sees a figure sitting at the end of his bed. His fingers are covered in bandages. Dobby jumps down.",
    "1122": "Harry gets out of bed, covers his eyes, blows his nose on his filthy garment, and hits his head with the medicine bottle. Harry grabs him, but Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Harry jumps back into bed as shadows appear in the doorway. A patient is carried in on a stretcher and lifted carefully onto a bed. Professor Dumbledore takes the camera from Colin Creevey's stiff fingers and opens the back. The film explodes. Hermione prepares a potion. A ghostly girl in school uniform shouts in Ron's face, then hovers high above their heads. She zooms into a cubicle and dives head first down the lavatory pan. In the Great Hall, a long platform has been erected. Lockhart strides along it and tosses his cloak to a group of excited girls. Snape steps onto the platform. Snape and Lockhart draw their wands and solemnly salute each other. They bow and turn, each takes a few steps away, then they turn again and face each other. Lockhart hurtles backwards down the platform and gets painfully to his feet. He beckons to Draco who steps forward. Looking worried, Lockhart passes Harry. Grim faced, Harry and Draco approach each other and stand face to face. Draco glares. They salute each other, then turn and walk away. The watching students hold their breath in anticipation. Harry and Draco face each other along the platform. Harry is somersaulted backwards. Draco smirks at his cronies as Harry scrambles up and points his wand. Draco's smile fades. Draco is spun in the air. As he crashes onto the platform, Snape hauls him to his feet and pushes him back towards Harry. Draco points his wand. A large snake appears in front of Harry. It uncoils itself and moves towards him. He backs away. The snake flies into the air, then falls again. It raises its head menacingly. Harry moves slowly towards it and starts to speak. The snake fixes its gaze on a boy in the crowd. Harry speaks again. The snake moves closer to the boy who backs away. Harry speaks again. The snake turns its head, staring at Harry and closes its mouth. The snake is reduced to ashes. Harry frowns and looks around the hall to find everyone staring at him. Harry runs into the Gryffindor Common Room followed by Ron and Hermione. He looks from one to the other. In a classroom, students are working quietly at long tables. Harry looks up from his books to see two girls staring at him curiously. He glances across at Ron and Hermione, who both give him an embarrassed smile. A group of students at another table look away quickly as he turns towards them.",
    "1123": "Even Ginny Weasley refuses to catch his eye. Harry puts down his quill and closes his book. He gets up from the table and puts his books under his arm. He senses that all the students are staring at him as he quickly walks out of the room. In the corridor, Harry hears the disembodied voice again. He follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously. Taking a deep breath, he walks slowly around a corner and stops at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor. They follow each other up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window. As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall. She hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away. Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue. It slowly turns, and Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door. A cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets. The walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old books. On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak. The hat scowls. Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames. Harry takes a step back. The bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch. Dumbledore appears at the top of a flight of stairs. A tiny head pokes out from the pile of black ash. The baby bird opens its beak.",
    "1125": "He picks up the radio. Outside of the clearing, Hermione tip-toes towards the invisible, protective shield. Her eyes peeled, she gazes into the gloom. Narrowing her eyes, she peers towards the dark shadows under the trees. In the tent, Harry studies the Marauder's Map. Snape's footprints appear near the headmaster's study. Hermione continues to prowl. She freezes as men approach, one carrying a woman. He passes by. A second man follows with someone slung over his shoulder. A third stops, just past Hermione. He retraces his steps, until he stands directly in front of her. She stands stalk still. He can see no sign of her, the tent, or the campfire. The second man drops the body from his shoulder. The man does as he's told. The three of them walk away. Harry joins Hermione. Hermione looks in the direction the men went. Her face is solemn. They walk towards the tent. Ron steps out of the tent. He sees the two of them together. He looks pale and haggard. As they journey through fields and past devastated homes, Ron grows more drawn and suspicious. They're camped under a bridge. Harry stands alone a little distance from them. Ron stays glued to the radio. Now, they're camped on the shore of a lake. At night, Ron lies awake. In the tent, Hermione is cutting Harry's hair. She stops suddenly. She consults a book. The light whisks away from the lamps. Hollow-eyed, Ron appears holding the deluminator. He returns the light. Harry lunges at him. The two friends glare at each other. Ron tugs off the locket and throws it down. Ron picks up his bag and scowls at Hermione. She looks distraught. She glances round at Harry, then back to Ron. She hesitates. Ron glowers at Harry. His mouth curled in a snarl, Ron storms out. Hermione follows. Harry paces uneasily. His face troubled, Harry remains alone inside the tent. Next morning, Harry steps out of the tent and sees Hermione standing by the water's edge, her back to him. She gazes anxiously across the wintry landscape. Harry waits as Hermione ties her scarf round a slender tree trunk. The locket dangles from her hand. She walks through dead bracken and stands beside Harry. He takes her hand. They apparate on a stony clifftop. Hermione sadly wipes her eyes. Harry moves away discreetly as she turns to hide her tears. High on the limestone clifftop, he creates a protective shield. Hermione sits huddled on a flat-topped rock. Harry stands alone, looking towards the setting sun. A dim light glows inside the tent. The wind ruffles Harry's hair as he walks over the rocks. He turns, hearing the faint sound of the radio.",
    "1126": "Inside the spacious tiny tent, Harry sits beside a table piled with camping equipment while Hermione crouches by a bunk bed, listening to the radio. Harry leans back in his chair, deep in thought, as Hermione stares blankly at Ron's radio with her knees drawn up to her chest. He crosses over to her and holds out a hand. Her face solemn, she takes both his hands and pulls herself up. Harry puts his arms around her neck and unfastens the locket, throwing it onto the lower bunk. His eyes fixed on hers, he draws her away from the radio. She looks pale and wistful. Still holding her hands, Harry starts to move to the music. They twist back and forth and she half-smiles. Hermione grins and they start to move a little more imaginatively. He spins around. They both smile and spin. His puts arm around her, they dance more closely. They hold their hands again. Laughing they start to jive. Hermione spins into his arms. Harry leans his head against her. She rests her chin on his shoulder. They turn slowly, holding each other close. Hermione's smile fades. They stop dancing. They meet each other's gaze. Hermione sighs and walks away. Harry watches her go. Hermione sits reading on the flat-topped rocks. Inside the tent, Harry lies on a bunk, his arms folded, idly watching the snitch hovering above his head. He reaches out his hand. The fluttering wings slow then fold away. Harry draws the snitch down and holds it against his mouth. He looks at it. Writing appears on the golden surface. I open at the close. He hands it to her. She puts down her book and studies the writing. Harry sits beside her. A triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She frowns at the drawing. She ruffles his hair, and smiles at him. Harry nods and grins after her, as she walks away. A few snowflakes drift past. They apparate in a quaint, snow covered village. Wearing winter clothes, they wander down a deserted street. She takes his arm. Two villagers come out of an inn behind them. A little gate leads into the churchyard. She turns to him. In the graveyard, surrounding the church, Harry and Hermione study the names on the graves. The snow gently falls. Hermione stops at a grave marked with a horizontal slab. She brushes snow from it with her gloved hand. Carved on the slab, is a triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She wipes away more snow, and finds a name engraved underneath. He is standing at the far side of the graveyard. He looks down at a plain, upright gravestone.",
    "1131": "Ron lowers his head while lying on the ground. Scabior examines Harry's disfigured face, which is bloated with his right eye closed, then grips his collar. As they approach the Malfoy Manor house, Scabior releases his hold near the gate. Hermione and Ron are close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate. Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys, looking expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back, pointing at Hermione. She spots the Sword of Gryffindor, held by a Snatcher. She's hurled backwards, her wand shooting out a snake that twists around Greyback's neck. A whip coils around Scabior, and she drags him along the floor. Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron. Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars. A figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar. Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor, Bellatrix sticking her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker, is present. Harry holds a piece of broken mirror, looking into it to see someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander. Griphook walks towards the gate, looks back, then climbs the stairs. Ron flicks on the deluminator. As the light returns, a small figure apparates. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander and takes their hands. The three disapparate. The cellar is dark. Wormtail opens the gate and is struck from behind, falling on his face. Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand. The Snitch flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A strand of hair falls onto Hermione's coat. Bellatrix cuts Griphook with a dagger, looking down at Hermione. Ron has a wand. Harry catches Bellatrix's wand and aims at Lucius. Bellatrix has Hermione, her dagger at Hermione's throat. Bellatrix grins. Harry's back to normal. Lucius glares at Draco, who freezes. With a sneer, his father pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, about to lay it on the mark. Bellatrix presses the dagger against Hermione's throat. They all look up. High above, Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione runs into Ron's arms. Harry snatches the wands from Draco and stuns Lucius, magicking Narcissa's wand away. Dobby stands on a balustrade, his arms outstretched. The trio and Griphook with the Sword of Gryffindor grab hold of him. Bellatrix flings her dagger towards them as they disapparate. The dagger vanishes with them.",
    "1137": "Ron peaks around a corner, while across the street behind him, Harry stands inside a small doorway. A woman in a neat business suit approaches, and Ron pretends to tie his shoelace. Harry casts a spell, causing the woman to faint. Ron helps Harry carry her inside, where they place her beside two unconscious men. Hermione plucks a hair from the woman's head, and they each hold a cup of Polyjuice. Harry, now morphed into Albert Runcorn, a man with dark hair, peeks out the door and steps out. He's followed by Ron, now a tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, Reginald Cattermole, and then by Hermione as the business woman, Mafalda Hopkirk. Inside, Harry and Ron, minus Hermione, join the men standing in lines outside cubicles. An older man pushes past, and Ron enters a cubicle. Harry waits for the next one, enters his cubicle, and shuts the door. He looks up to see Ron, now Reg, peering over the dividing wall. Harry looks at the pedestal, then at Ron, who frowns. Harry stands on the edge of the toilet, steps onto the bowl, pulls the chain, and is flushed spinning down the loo. He emerges in a green fireplace, stepping out into a long tiled corridor. Ron emerges further back along the corridor, and everyone is walking in the same direction. Ron and Harry join them. Ahead, Harry sees guards in uniform, and two guards apprehend a man walking behind him. He joins a nervous-looking Hermione, both in their morphed shapes of Mafalda and Albert. A statue shows muggles being crushed, and Ron joins them. They enter a lift, and Yaxley, a Death Eater with a fair pigtail, addresses Ron, then walks away. The gate closes, and the lift hurtles backwards, then shoots up. The gate slides open, and Harry pushes Ron out. Ron stands in a circular atrium, and the lift reverses, then descends. Two men scuttle across in front of him, and the gate opens onto Umbridge. She steps in, turns to Harry, and with stiff robotic movements, Harry gets out of the lift. The gate closes, and Harry looks round at Hermione. The lift backs away and descends. Harry wanders along a curved corridor, and in a large open plan office, clerks with wands flick copies of a booklet from their desks into trays. He passes with a herd of minions carrying papers. An eyeball rotates in a peephole. Harry glances around, then drops a small black object onto the floor. It develops legs and feet, scuttles away, and multiplies as it goes. Each one produces a horn and a white up-key on the top. They scatter among the desks in the open plan office and erupt, causing a diversion.",
    "1143": "A merman prepares to attack. Cedric appears with a transparent bubble of air over his mouth and nose and frees Cho with his wand, scaring off the merman. Cedric taps his watch. Harry nods and draws his wand to release Hermione, but a sharp, pointed trident is held at his throat. Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark looms towards him. The shark has human legs and arms and wears red shorts. It flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron's arm and looks at the girl with long, fair hair, now floating alone. He looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds and uses his wand to release the little girl. Eight minutes to 12. Cedric and Cho are the first to the surface and swim ashore. Dumbledore and Crouch hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion. Hermione appears on the surface with the shark, its head transforming into Viktor Krum immediately. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed. He's suddenly attacked from below by a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nipping at his ankles. He tries to kick them away and releases his grip on Ron and the little girl, pushing them up towards the surface. Harry clutches his neck as hundreds of the creatures attack him, almost suffocating him with their tentacles. Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand. Sparks fly, stunning the grindylows and sending them flying in all directions. Harry sinks to the bottom. Twelve o'clock. Ron and the little girl bob to the surface. Fleur leans out over the water and stretches out her hand. His gills now gone, Harry drifts helplessly and looks up at the patch of light above his head. With the last desperate effort, he raises his wand and rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air. Fleur kisses Harry, then kisses Ron and wraps a towel around him. Dumbledore puts his wand to his throat. Karkaroff is furious. Harry is with Crouch. Wild-haired Moody glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused. Moody swigs from his hip flask. In the forest at night, Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground and clutches the scar in his forehead. A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves, heaped-in and lifeless. Harry approaches Professor Dumbledore's room. The door is closed. Moody opens the door.",
    "1147": "Red light streams from Harry's wand, green light from Voldemort's. The power from their wands collides and meets like molten lava in a burst of bright flame. Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other. Harry controls his quivering wand with both hands. Voldemort's face is twisted with hatred. Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky. The ghostly images of Voldemort's victims appear. First Cedric, then Bryce, the old caretaker, killed in the mansion. Harry's father and mother appear at his side. His father speaks. Breaking the connection, Harry grabs Cedric. The cup flies into his hand. Voldemort howls with frustration. Harry lands with Cedric in the arena. The spectators go wild. Fleur senses that something is wrong. Dumbledore gets up. He tries to pull Harry away. Harry clings to Cedric's body. Mr. Diggory bursts through the spectators. He weeps over Cedric's body. Moody pulls Harry up. Moody helps Harry away. The students stand, stunned into silence. Still in a state of shock, Harry walks into Professor Moody's room. Moody slides shut the iron lock on the heavy wooden door. Harry stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm. His clothes are torn. His face is bloody. Moody pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire. Harry's deep gash is revealed. He grips Harry's arm. Moody's face twists with agony. Moody opens his hip flask but finds it empty. He runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box. They are all empty. Moody stands in the doorway behind him. He searches the shelves. He glares at Harry with his mad eye. Grabbing Harry's arm, he sucks Harry's blood from his fingers. The door bursts open, and Moody is flung hard against the stone wall. Dumbledore grabs him. Snape pours truth serum into Moody's mouth. Moody looks towards the locked trunk. Snape points his wand. The lid flies open. Then six more trunks open, one inside the other. Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft. A figure with one leg and one eye lies far below. Snape sniffs the flask. They turn and watch his face and body start to twist with the violent convulsions. He wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye, and flings it down. He transforms into a younger man, who lashes out angrily. It's Mr. Crouch's son. He lunges at Harry. Barty reveals the dark mark. Dumbledore uncovers Harry's wound. Snape presses his wand hard against Barty's cheek. Barty narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue. The entire school is assembled in the great hall. Dumbledore finds Harry packing his case in the boys' bedroom.",
    "1148": "Harry smiles. As evening falls, they join the excited crowds in the magnificent Quidditch stadium. The spectators take their seats in the stands, many of them wearing colorful national costumes. He stops Harry with his walking stick then smacks at Harry. Spotlight beams illuminate the packed stands. Hermione and the twins wear green and white scarves. Mr. Diggory takes them to the highest level of the stadium. The seven Irish players zoom out in formation, green and white smoke streaming from their broomsticks. Fireworks explode in the shape of a spiritedly Leprechaun dancing a jig. The opposing team in black and red fly high above the pitch, one turns a somersault. A gigantic image of the handsome Bulgarian player is projected onto the towering stands. He hovers in front of a waving flag proclaiming the name Krum. Krum raises his fist confidently. Cornelius Fudge uses his wand to amplify his voice. A bright ball of light springs from his wand and plunges down towards the arena. Back in the tent, George and friends celebrate the Irish victory. Mr. Weasley lights a lamp then hurries them out of the tent. The camp is in chaos, many of the tents are on fire, and flames leap high into the darkness. Harry sees ominous cloaked figures with skeleton masks and tall pointed hats, carrying flaming torches. He starts to run. Wrestled away from Hermione and the others, Harry dodges through the panicking crowd. In the confusion, Harry trips and falls. As he struggles to get up, flying feet knock him aside. Light from the burning tents flickers across his face, as he lies unconscious on the muddy ground. Everything goes black. A full moon shines down on the devastated camp. A lone figure strides between the smoking tents, kicking the smoldering remains. The figure points a wand into the dark sky and casts a spell. A huge, ghostly, green skull appears, with a snake emerging from its mouth. It floats above his head. The young man bears his teeth with an evil smile of satisfaction. Harry slowly regains consciousness and sits up. He sees the shadowy figure approaching through the smoke. Harry gets to his feet and runs away from the dark figure. The figure runs off. Seeing the skull, Harry clutches his scar. A group of ministry wizards gazes up nervously at the ghostly skull, a dark mark still hovering above their heads. Ron counts his money. Harry nods to a young Chinese girl. She gives him a shy smile. Harry scratches his eyebrow. Hermione leans forward. Harry addresses an envelope to his godfather, Sirius Black. He puts the letter into Hedwig's beak. The snowy owl flies out of the train window and soars away over a lake, as the Express steams on towards Hogwarts.",
    "115": "Neff sits before the dictaphone. Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, but halfway there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar. He stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil from his vest. He stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it. Keyes puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They move on. They stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters: EDWARD S.NORTON, JR. PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door. They go in. As Keyes and Neff enter, the door to Norton's private office is opened. From inside, Mr. Norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. Norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous in manner. He sees Keyes and Neff. Neff has put down his hat and briefcase. He and Keyes pass the legal looking men and follow Norton into his office. Naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, smoking stands, easy chairs, etc. Norton has gone behind his desk. Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door quietly. Norton looks disapprovingly at Keyes' shirt sleeves. Norton smiles frostily. Keyes and Neff sit down, Norton remains standing. He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard. There is a charged pause. He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes. The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear. He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff. Keyes and Neff start to get up. The secretary has opened the door. Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her. He turns a little towards Keyes. Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Phyllis nods silently. Neff, behind him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely dead-pan. She looks towards Neff. Neff is staring straight at Phyllis. Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second. She makes as if to rise indignantly. She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is a pregnant pause. Keyes stands up. He grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp. Norton is watching him almost stupefied.",
    "1151": "Dumbledore reads the name written on a piece of parchment. Viktor punches the air in triumph. His friends congratulate him. He rises from his seat and shakes Dumbledore by the hand. He leaves the hall. The flame flares again. Dumbledore reads a second piece of smoldering parchment. Beaming with pleasure, Fleur shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor. Smiling broadly, Cedric shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor and Fleur out of the hall. Mr. Crouch uncovers a magnificent crystal and silver trophy. Snape steps forward alarmed as the goblet of fire flares once more. Dumbledore turns in surprise as the blue flame leaps high into the air. The flame turns red. Karkaroff glares. Sparks fly from a piece of scorched parchment. It flutters down into Dumbledore's hand. He reads it. All eyes turn to Harry, who sits down nervously. Hagrid shakes his head. Hermione forces Harry to his feet. Ron glowers as Harry walks hesitantly towards Professor Dumbledore. The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges. Dumbledore thrusts it into Harry's hand. Looking stunned, Harry walks the length of the hall, uncomfortably aware of unfriendly looks from his fellow students. Snape narrows his eyes as Harry passes him. Professor McGonagall pats his shoulder reassuringly. Mad-Eye Moody gives him a hard stare. A pair of iron gates opens in front of Harry. The other three competitors look surprised to see him. Dumbledore bursts into the room, followed by Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime. Dumbledore grabs Harry. Every eye in the room is focused on Harry. He swallows nervously. Outside, rain pours from the mouth of a gargoyle. In a high tower, the Hogwarts professors meet and consult together. Professor McGonagall looks anxiously at Dumbledore. He puts his wand to his temple. A thread of memory drifts into a bowl. A parchment with Harry's name surfaces. Harry sits on his bed. Ron hangs a wet towel beside the stove. Ron climbs into his four-poster bed. Ron turns his back. Harry scrambles into bed. Ron looks across at him. Harry takes off his glasses and pulls up the covers. Ron lies awake, his face buried in his pillow. The competitors pose for a photo. She looks at Harry. In a tiny room, a green quill hovers over a notebook. Rita pushes Harry inside. The quill writes. She winks at him. Harry gestures to the quill. A small black owl swoops over Hogwarts School. It heads towards a tall, isolated tower. Harry is waiting in the owlery as the black owl flies in through the window. He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads. Harry sucks his pecked finger. On Saturday night, he hurries down into the Gryffindor common room.",
    "1153": "Filch fires the cannon by mistake. Cedric swallows hard and takes a deep breath. In the competitors' tent, Harry sits alone in nervous trepidation. Harry walks out into a circular arena hewn from the rocky hillside and surrounded by a stone wall. High in the wooden terraces, Ron and Hermione stand amongst the cheering spectators. Harry resembles a gladiator in a Roman Arena. He glances around cautiously. Harry moves towards a gleaming golden egg standing amongst the gray rocks. He is knocked off his feet by the force of the dragon's tail. The dragon's massive head and body are covered with sharp, lethal spikes. It blasts flame. Harry leaps for safety up a high rock. The tethered dragon flies to the end of its long chain. It lashes out angrily, giving Harry a vicious blow with its tail. He is flung onto the rocks below. The Hungarian Horntail flaps its huge leathery wings. Harry scrambles to his feet. He dodges another burst of flame. The crowd flinches. Karkaroff laughs. As the dragon flaps towards him, Harry climbs out of range. It lunges after him, baring its teeth. Taking shelter behind a huge rock, Harry sees his trusty broomstick zooming towards him. The dragon belches out another burst of flame. Harry leaves the rock, leaps away from the dragon, and jumps onto his Firebolt as it swoops down into the arena. Harry's friends cheer him on. The angry dragon stretches out its neck, breaking the chain. The creature flies free. Followed by the furious dragon, Harry zooms around the arena. He bursts out through the stands over the heads of the startled onlookers, wings tearing through the canopy, scattering professors. They scramble to their feet. Rita Skeeter straightens her spectacles. Pursued by the dragon, Harry flies over the valley towards the school. He narrowly avoids colliding with a tall stone tower. The dragon launches after him, as Harry swoops low of the Hogwards. A faint mist is rising. As he flies, Harry checks over his shoulder. But the dragon is nowhere to be seen. As Harry rounds one of the towers, the dragon appears and knocks him off his broomstick. Harry falls onto a stiff roof and hurtles downwards. He stops his fall by grabbing desperately onto a narrow parapet. The dragon settles on a nearby turret. Harry dangles from the parapet, his gloved hands clutching a spiked pinnacle. He sees his broomstick far below. The dragon scrabbles across the turret onto the roof above Harry. The pinnacle snaps. Harry plunges down onto a windowsill. He hangs on desperately as the sill collapses under him. Dislodging tiles, the dragon claws its way across the roof towards him like a colossal bat.",
    "1154": "Harry scrambles up and reaches high above his head for a broomstick. The dragon gets closer and closer, but the Firebolt is stuck fast. Harry frees the broomstick as the dragon lashes out, smashing the window to pieces. Harry falls from a great height, pursued by the Horntail. He reappears out of the mist once again astride his broomstick. A dragon's close behind and a burst of flame sets the end of Harry's broomstick on fire. It continues to smolder as the dragon zooms after Harry through a stone arch. Ahead is the massive viaduct. Harry flies towards it and hurtles through one of the narrow openings at the top. As the dragon tries to bat, its huge wings smash into the brickwork. Harry and the Horntail plunge into the valley far below. The crowd of spectators in the arena scan the sky with nervous anticipation. Dumbledore and Fudge look very concerned. Hagrid shields his eyes as he looks up into the empty sky. A tiny speck appears in the distance. Hermione screams. Harry hovers for a moment, then aims the Firebolt down towards the gleaming golden egg, and triumphantly snatches it up. In a packed Gryffindor common room, the painted characters in the pictures join in the applause. The twins hoist Harry onto their shoulders. The egg glows as Harry twists it open. They clap their hands over their ears. Ron appears in the doorway. Harry closes the egg. Ron faces Harry awkwardly. The twins usher everyone away. Hermione shakes her head, bemused. Gray clouds are reflected in the waters of the lake. Owls fly in and out of the great hall. Parvati and Padma Patil walk together down the length of the hall. They pass the table where Harry and his friends are eating breakfast. Harry sees Cho at the next table. As her friend points him out, Cho smiles. Embarrassed, Harry dribbles his drink. Hermione reads the paper. The small boy lingers at Ron's elbow. Hermione looks curious. He unpacks a strange brown garment and holds it up. White frills. The twins try it. Ron gets up reluctantly, his shirt hanging out. Filch starts the gramophone. The twins grin. The girls get up enthusiastically, but none of the boys moves. Then Neville stands up. Later, Harry and Ron find Neville waltzing by himself around the bedroom, wearing his pajamas and a pair of shiny dancing shoes. Ron and Harry approach Cho and her friends. The boys grin inanely, then move on hurriedly. He smiles at a group of Beauxbatons girls who stalk off. Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Madame Maxime reaches down to pick something from Hagrid's beard. She pops it in her mouth and licks her fingers seductively. Hermione, Harry, and Ron sit beside the lake.",
    "116": "Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk. With the doorknob in his hand, Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves. They go out. The corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, puts the key in his pocket. He picks up the phone. Phyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's office. He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The door bell rings. Neff stops in sudden alarm. For a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes. Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns. He prods his stomach with his thumb. He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes. Keyes shakes his head suddenly. Keyes prods his stomach again. Keyes resumes his pacing. Finally Keyes continues. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally Neff can't stand the silence any longer. He crosses to the corridor door. He puts his hand on the knob to open the door. The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out. Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide so as to hide her from Keyes. He pushes the call button and turns. He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance. She moves toward him but he does not respond. He pulls her close and kisses her. Two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work. Several visitors are waiting in chairs. Lola Dietrichson is one of them. She's wearing a simple black suit and hat, indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously.",
    "1161": "Harry staggers in with Dudley. Dudley, about to be sick, points weakly at Harry. An owl hits the ceiling and falls in a flurry of feathers. The owl flies off. The envelope speaks. Uncle Vernon smirks with glee. Under cover of darkness, the Dursleys smuggle Dudley into the car with a blanket over his head. Mrs. Figg watches from her window opposite. Mrs. Figg waves. In his bedroom, Harry thumps the wardrobe in anger and frustration. A photograph standing beside his owl's cage falls onto the carpet. Harry picks it up. He sits on his bed and looks at his parents dancing together in the moving photograph. Harry places it carefully on his bedside table beside a half-eaten plate of food. Cedric's face looms out of the darkness sweating with fear. Harry relives his terror as a flash of green light engulfs Cedric, who falls lifeless. Voldemort's blank eyes stare out from his bony snake-like skull. Harry jerks awake. A streak of moonlight is across his pillow. He lies as if in a trance, his lips moving. He turns his head as he hears a scraping sound. Still fully dressed, Harry reaches for his glasses and puts them on. He looks towards the door. The key is slowly turning in the lock. Harry grabs his wand and sits up. The key continues to turn. The key falls to the floor. With a dazzling flash, the door flies open. Lit by a wand, five people stand in the doorway. Harry recognizes one of them. Moody leads them all outside. Moody taps his stick. A broomstick flies into each person's hand. Mrs. Figg watches as they soar away high above Privet Drive. The twinkling lights of central London are spread out below. Kingsley, a wizard in African robes, flies in front. Following the line of the River Thames as it winds through the city. They fly low, cloaks flying, like a flight of huge bats skimming the surface of the shimmering water. They swoop by HMS Belfast and head upriver towards Westminster. Harry flies close beside Nymphadora Tonks. The pleasure boat on a nighttime cruise heads straight toward them. Nymphadora steers to the right of it. Harry to the left. They pass the flood-lit houses of Parliament, reflected in the water like a huge ocean liner. A refuse lorry passes a garden in the middle of the London square. Moody leads them from the garden into the street. Facing a terrace of Georgian houses, he strikes the pavement. One of the houses in front of them moves to the left. Harry's jaw drops. As an extra house slides into the space and balconies slot into position. Oblivious, the people next door continue watching television.",
    "1166": "The student army faces a metal figure dressed as a cloaked Dementor holding a wand. A target is painted on its chest. Harry nods to Neville. Neville's wand is hurled across the room. The Dementor's wand falls. Filch lurks behind a pillar, spotting students approaching the room. He reaches the door as it dissolves back into the stone wall. Nigel, a plucky small boy, faces Harry and prepares himself. Harry is thrown backwards. Eating a huge sandwich, Filch guards the blank wall. Ron faces Hermione. Neville encourages Ron. Ron flies backwards. Fred collects his winnings. Outside, Filch wakes from a doze. Nigel keeps watch as everyone leaves the room through another door. A student is ushered into Umbridge's room. Nigel floats in mid-air. Harry guides Cho's wand. She turns to look at him. Nigel plummets to the ground. He tucks in. The twins hide nearby. Red pustules break out all over Filch's face. Umbridge snaps her pencil. Umbridge's squad includes Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Filch. Luna skips along the corridor. The inquisitorial squad watch her go through the large wooden doors. The squad run. The door shrinks. They fall into a broom cupboard. Ginny Weasley's spell destroys the metal Dementor. It disintegrates into a pile of dust. She is amazed at her own skill. Her three brothers look rather put out. Harry beams. He watches Cho. She gives him a shy smile. Neville is determined to succeed. The wand spins out of a girl's hand. Harry congratulates him. Harry smiles proudly as his pupils applaud. The students start to leave. Ron and Hermione exchange a smile when they notice that Harry is watching Cho. She is lingering beside a mirror covered with photographs. Harry can't take his eyes off her. Ron and Hermione leave. Fred and George leave the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Cho in front of the mirror. They both look at a moving photograph of a smiling Cedric. She smiles at him. Cho looks up as something green and white appears above their heads. Harry gazes into her dark eyes. Their lips meet in a gentle kiss. They're standing close together, but only their lips touch. Above their heads, the bunch of mistletoe continues to grow. Ron looks blank. Harry catches Ron's eye. The three friends smile warmly. The black corridor. Harry writhes in his sleep. A snake reflected in the shining black. The blue door. The glass sphere. The light of a wand. A figure in a room full of shelves. It's Mr. Weasley, his eyes wide with alarm. Harry's neck flexes. Mr. Weasley falls. Mr. Weasley struggles. Harry's neck flexes again and again. Mr. Weasley lies still, covered in blood. Harry wakes.",
    "1167": "Professor McGonagall and Ron help Harry to Dumbledore's study, where Ginny is already present with the twins. Dumbledore turns from the moving portraits to face Harry, and Professor Snape approaches from behind. Snape takes Harry down to his storeroom and raises his wand, causing Harry's body to go rigid. Harry gasps in agony as his mind fills with terrifying memories. Outside, the wind sends a flurry of snowflakes in all directions, and the snow begins to settle on the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School until the screen turns white. Children throw snowballs outside the London house, where the kitchen is decorated for Christmas. Mr. Weasley is brought in, looking battered and bruised, in a wheelchair, and wearing a paper hat. Standing in the doorway, Sirius raises his glass and winks, wearing a knitted jerkin. Harry finds a room where the walls are covered with a tapestry, sewn with names and faces, but startles when he sees a house elf and skulks off. Sirius's image has been burnt away from the tapestry, but Sirius embraces Harry and hugs him affectionately. Harry joins Hermione, and Sirius looks back at the family tree and his own obliterated face before closing the door. A gray sky is reflected in the river, with Hogwarts School standing high on the cliffs above. Harry chats with Cho as they walk through the courtyard until Hermione finds them, and Harry turns to Cho before hurrying off with Hermione. Harry, Ron, and Hermione run down the hill towards Hagrid's cottage, where a faint plume of smoke rises from the chimney. They hide as Umbridge comes out, wearing a fluffy purple coat over her pink dress, sniffs, wrinkles her nose, sprays herself with perfume, then sprays a cross on the cottage door. Inside, Hagrid's face is red and bruised, and he holds a raw steak to his eye, which the huge dog gobbles eagerly. The wind blows wisps of straw across the room, and Hagrid looks out of the window as a flash of lightning strikes. A snake tattooed on a man's arm twists and writhes, and a woman with wild hair runs her tongue over the snake tattooed on her arm. She hears an explosion and, wearing striped prison clothes, escapes through a gaping hole. Dementors circle high above the prison, a colossal triangular tower, surrounded by an angry sea. Neville slowly closes the newspaper at breakfast. A cozy fire burns in the Room of Requirement, where Harry joins Neville, who is looking at a photograph stuck up on the mirror. The photograph that Sirius gave Harry at the station includes Neville's parents as part of the group. Harry nods reassuringly and looks at his own parents. A horse appears, Hermione's is an otter, Ron's is a dog, and Luna produces a hare, which leaps joyfully over their heads. Harry grins proudly as the chandelier begins to shake.",
    "1169": "An owl takes wing and swoops low along the misty road, then glides silently away through the trees. An upright elderly gentleman with a flowing white beard, long silky white hair, and a pointed black hat appears out of the shadows. A plump tabby cat sitting on a wall turns its head curiously as the old gentleman walks along the pavement and stops beneath a street light. He holds a small metal object which he flicks open and points at a street lamp. The light from the lamp flies towards his hand, and the lamp goes out. The light from the second street lamp disappears, and then a third, until all the lights in the road have been extinguished. The old gentleman lowers the metal object and flicks it shut, then looks over the top of his half-moon glasses at the plump tabby cat. The cat gives a hiccup, its shadow looms large against the wall, and it turns into a stern-looking woman wearing a cloak and a tall pointed black hat with a large brim. A bright light appears in the sky above the treetops, revealing the lights of a motorcycle. Coattails flying, Hagrid, a huge giant, zooms down and screeches to a halt. His twinkling eyes peer out below dark bushy eyebrows, and he has a huge black beard. He hands over a small bundle wrapped in a warm blanket, which Professor Dumbledore gently places on a doorstep. A tear runs down Hagrid's cheek as the tiny baby with a jagged scar on his forehead lies fast asleep. Years later, in the cupboard under the stairs, Harry Potter wakes and puts on a pair of large round spectacles mended with sticky tape. A pudgy boy crushes down the stairs, causing a shower of dust to fall on Harry. The pudgy boy rushes into the kitchen, followed by Harry. Dudley stares at the huge pile of birthday presents. Dudley and his mother get into the car with a big bag of sweets, and Uncle Vernon wags his car key in Harry's face. In the Reptile House at the zoo, Dudley stares at the sleeping python. Vernon bangs on the glass, but Harry looks at the snake sympathetically. The python lifts its head and winks, then flicks its tongue and nods, and shakes its head. Dudley knocks Harry aside, and suddenly, the glass partition disappears. Dudley tumbles over the rail and falls head first into the pond inside the snake's enclosure. Dudley sits spluttering in the pond, as the snake slithers over the wooden rail and down onto the floor beside Harry. The python raises its head and stares straight at him.",
    "1170": "Harry lines up next to the keeper, Oliver Wood, and swallows nervously. The gate opens and the team steps forward. One after the other, they fly out of the player's tunnel and swoop around between the tall spectator towers, which surround the oval grassy arena. A student introduces the game. In the stands, the Gryffindor supporters wear red and gold scarves, Slytherin's colors are green and white. The Slytherin team fly out in their green cloaks. Standing around the oval arena, the spectators cheer on their teams. Other spectators are seated at the top of tall towers hung with heraldic designs. The players hover above the Quidditch trunk, which stands quivering in the center of the pitch. She kicks the trunk. The lid falls open and three boars fly out. Madam Hooch lifts out the red Quaffle and throws it high into the air. A Gryffindor chaser, Angelina, grabs the Quaffle and heads straight for the goal. The spectators duck as the players swoop low over their heads. The Slytherin players try to hit Angelina off, but she's too quick for them. She aims for the center hoop and the Quaffle sails straight through the middle. The points go up on the score board. Harry is nearly knocked off his broomstick by a passing Bludger. Hagrid cheers on the Gryffindors. Snape stares, Quirrell looks nervous. The Slytherin captain gives Angelina a slight kick. Dodging a Bludger, he hurls the Quaffle towards a hoop, then scowls as Oliver skillfully knocks it away and gives him a cheeky smile. The Gryffindors capture the Quaffle. Ducking and diving, they pass it around the team from chaser to chaser. Well placed in front of the goal, Angelina catches the Quaffle and hurls it straight through the center of the hoop, past the helpless Slytherin keeper. Twenty points on the score board. The Gryffindor supporters are ecstatic. The Slytherin captain aims again for the goal, but Oliver catches the Quaffle. The captain smiles angrily. Snatching a bat from a beater, he deliberately hits a Bludger straight to Oliver, who falls backwards through the hoop. He hurtles downwards landing heavily on the dry sand below the goal. Harry stares with disbelief at the cheating Slytherin captain. Malfoy and his cronies celebrate while Professor McGonagall watches anxiously. A Slytherin sails over the beater's head and shoots accurately at the hoop. The Quaffle flies through. Harry clenches his fists with frustration. Ten points to Slytherin. The Slytherin captain points at Angelina. Slytherin captain and his teammate, one on each side, jostling and confusing her. She collides with one of the tall spectator towers, tumbles down behind the canvas covering, and lies without moving on the gravel path below.",
    "1172": "In the courtyard, snow falls onto the tars and turrets of the school. Wearing a huge fur coat, Hagrid plods across the snow-covered courtyard, dragging behind him an enormous Christmas tree. Inside the school, Hermione pulls a trunk on wheels past a group of ghostly Carol singers. She goes into the great hall, where tiny Professor Flitwick waves his wand and levitates decorations onto a tall Christmas tree. Hermione finds Ron and Harry playing chess at one of the long polished tables. She walks down the brightly decorated hall to join them. The white knight moves by itself. Ron contemplates the board. The red queen moves and knocks the knight's head off. Harry's snowy owl turns its head, as he leaps out of bed and puts on his spectacles. Down in the Gryffindor common room, Ron is standing in front of a blazing fire. Harry runs barefoot down the stone stairs towards a pile of presents under the Christmas tree. Harry picks up a parcel, while Ron dips into a box of every flavor beans. Harry opens a letter. He puts down the letter and unties the string on the parcel. He unfolds the silver wrapping paper, and takes out some soft material with a rich dark pattern. Harry swings it onto his shoulders. His head is floating. In the library, a floating hand carries a lantern between the bookshelves. Under the invisibility cloak, Harry peers about him wearily. Inside, he searches along more dark bookshelves. Harry takes off the cloak and holds the lantern closer to a shelf. Then he puts the light down. As he takes down a book and opens it, a screaming face bursts violently out of the pages. Harry slams the book shut. Grabbing his cloak, Harry knocks over the lamp. He quickly puts on the invisibility cloak over his head and disappears. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern. The lamp light shows up his thin lips. Hidden by the invisibility cloak, Harry feels his way across the dark room. He stops for a moment, as Filch passes by with his lantern. He breathes a sigh of relief, as the caretaker goes out through a far doorway. Harry creeps into a moonlit corridor, where Filch's red-eyed cat is lurking. Harry is still invisible. As the cat runs past, two professors, Snape and Quirrell burst through a door. Suddenly suspicious, Snape turns around. Harry covers his mouth to muffle his breathing. Snape makes a grab, but only snatches a handful of air. Harry takes a step backwards. Snape turned sharply back to Quirrell. A lamp. Quirrell, Snape and Filch rush away down the corridor. A door, in the far wall seems to open and close by itself.",
    "118": "Neff is in the booth dialing a number and looks around to make sure he is not watched. He hangs up. The LaSalle stops in front of the market. Phyllis steps out and goes into the market, looking around. Neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge. From beyond him, Phyllis approaches and stops beside him, facing the same way, with a couple of feet separating them. She moves close to him and looks at him sharply, sideways. A customer comes along the aisle toward them. They move apart. The customer passes. Phyllis draws close again and takes his arm, forgetting where she is. He pulls away. Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes. Over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the COMMENTARY. Neff and Lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground. The sky is starlit and music from the Bowl comes over the scene from below (Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony). As he helps her climb up, CAMERA PANS with them and shows the expanse of the Bowl below, a packed audience, and the orchestra on the lighted shell. They sit down on the grass. Neff sits near her, not too close. It is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match. He glances at her. She is crying. A pause follows. She begins to cry again. Over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the commentary. About 5:00 P.M. or a little later. A stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side. Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars. He is stuffing them into his pockets. He bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into his mouth. He starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual. Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator. Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding the horn. He is deeply moved. Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall.",
    "1184": "Harry makes a grab but Malfoy spins out of reach. Malfoy flings the Remembrall away with all his might. The glass bowl flies over and over in the air. Harry steers his broom and it soars a high stone tower. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall sees Harry hurtling towards her window. Just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard, as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years. Professor McGonagall walks towards them, purposefully. Malfoy and his cronies snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall. She stops outside a classroom. The twins. Hermione shows him a name on a Gryffindor Trophy. They go upstairs. The staircase swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs. They see a statue covered in cobwebs. A torch flares. The caretaker's scary red-eyed cat watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch. Taking out her wand. The door opens, and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker. He holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously. In the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, glistening teeth. The children rush for the door. One of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway. They slam the door shut. Daylight. Oliver and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball. Chained down, two brown balls struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat, then unchains one of the brown balls. It shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat. He knocks the ball high into the air. It flies over the head of a statue on the battlements. The ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball. Delicate, golden wings spring out of the snitch and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand. Hermione flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a pile of books. Seamus' face is smudged with soot. A smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past. The Great Hall is lit with flaming torches. Candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, which float above the heads of the students.",
    "1185": "The tables are spread with a banquet of mouthwatering food, cakes, sweets, pies, and shiny red apples. Harry looks at the empty chair beside him. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell bursts into the hall. Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet. Quirrell faints. As the students follow quickly into the Hall, Snape disappears through a side door. Harry and Ron run back down the long stone corridor towards the girls' bathroom. They hide as they see a monstrous shadow ahead of them. The troll is dragging a heavy club. Wiping her eyes, Hermione comes out of the toilet. She sees two green legs as thick as great tree trunks. Terrified, she stares up with horror at the troll's lumpy, green body blocking the doorway. Its horrible head, which looks like a squashed, green potato, is almost touching the high ceiling. Raising the club, the troll moves ominously towards her. Hermione locks herself in a toilet. The troll swings the club and smashes it along the row of cubicles. The flimsy partitions fall on top of Hermione. The boys burst into the bathroom. As more cubicles are smashed to smithereens, they throw broken pieces of wood at the troll. Ron hurls a length of metal pipe. Hermione hides under a row of wash basins. Terrified, she cowers against the pipes as the troll smashes a sink off the wall. Harry pulls out his wand. He grabs the swinging club and scrambles up onto the troll's back. He tries to shake him off. Harry hangs on with one hand. But before he can use his wand, he accidentally rams it up the troll's nostril. The angry troll holds Harry upside down, swinging him from side to side. Ron takes out his wand. The troll's club flies up into the air and hovers. Then, it falls and hits the troll hard on its ugly, green head. The troll drops Harry. He scuttles out of the way, as the troll reels dizzily around then crashes heavily to the ground. As the dust settles, Hermione creeps out from under the row of sinks. Water sprays out of a shattered pipe. She looks at the troll nervously. Harry pulls his wand out of the troll's nostril. He wipes it on his cloak. Ron smiles at Harry. Quirrell steps forward. He jumps as the troll gives a snort. At breakfast, Snape appears. Harry notices that Snape is limping. Harry's snowy owl flies into the great hall skimming over their heads. It drops a long thin parcel. Harry catches it. They unwrap the brown paper, to reveal a streamline broomstick with a highly polished handle. Stroking the white owl's feathers, Professor McGonagall smiles at Harry. Wearing leather gloves and scarlet and gold cloaks, the Gryffindor Quidditch team assemble in the player's tunnel.",
    "1187": "Pettigrew grabs Lupin's wand, then turns back into a rat and runs off, leaving only a pile of clothes. Hermione grabs Harry's arm to stop him from following. Lupin's fingers turn to claws, he bursts out of his clothes, his limbs grow thin and twisted, and his face becomes a long snout with sharp teeth. He flings Sirius aside and stands whimpering. Hermione slowly approaches as the creature looks at her pathetically and howls to the moon. Snape appears and the werewolf lashes out at him. The black dog leaps out of the shadows, knocks the werewolf to the ground, and the animals face each other growling before both leap to the attack. They collide in mid air, then fall, snarling and biting. The dog runs off, chased by the werewolf. Harry follows and sees the werewolf hurling the dog against a rock. Harry throws a stone and hits the werewolf on the back of the head. It turns slowly and lopes menacingly towards him, then stops and lifts its head before running towards the sound of the howling. From where the dog fell, a figure gets up and limps away through the bushes. Harry follows the figure, hurrying through the trees towards the moonlit lake. He runs down the bank and across the stony shore to the edge of the water. Sirius is lying on his back, his eyes closed, a bloody claw mark on his shoulder. The water lapping the shore stops moving as a sheet of crackling ice spreads over the surface of the lake. Sirius opens his eyes and shudders with horror. Harry looks up and sees a swarm of hooded Dementors circling above their heads, their black cloaks fluttering behind them. One swoops down and attacks Sirius. Harry pulls out his wand and points it at the Dementors. A silver mist forms a protective shield and the Dementors are held back, but the power of Harry's wand fades and the Dementors return to the attack. He cries out in horror as he falls back onto the stony beach beside Sirius. Again, the Dementors circle overhead, then swoop lower and lower, hovering over the two figures lying helpless below as life is gradually sucked out of them. A faint, silvery breath floats from Sirius' half-open mouth, illuminating his face. Exhausted, Harry lifts his head and sees the Dementors floating harmlessly. He sees something shining on the far side of the frozen lake. Glowing amongst the trees, a magnificent silver stag with huge antlers stands facing him. Harry gazes at the beautiful animal. The dazzling light surrounding the stag grows even brighter and as the Dementors start to move again, they are turned back by a powerful invisible shield and swoop away over Harry's head.",
    "1188": "A tiny, silvery breath floats back into Sirius' mouth and his chest heaves. He gives a great sigh. The light draws back across the lake. Harry watches the bright light fade away, leaving only the faint image of a figure standing on the far shore. He falls back beside his godfather. They lie next to each other, sprawled unconscious on the stony beach. In the hospital wing, Harry pats Ron's bandaged leg. He walks to the door. Hermione is wearing a long chain necklace. She puts it around Harry's neck as well and spins its golden pendant. The room is filled with people moving backwards very fast. She replaces the necklace. The wheels of the great clock turn. They cross the quadrangle below and run along the cloister. She shows him the pendant. They hide. Harry and Hermione creep out from their hiding place. Harry looks around nervously as they run towards a huge stone. Standing behind it, they look down the hill. They watch themselves running along the path below towards Hagrid's cottage and the pumpkin patch. Harry and Hermione hurry down the path and hide behind the pile of pumpkins. Dumbledore, Fudge and the Executioner. She pulls him back out of sight. Hermione sees a pebble lying on the pumpkin in front of her. She throws the pebble through the window. She throws another. Harry rubs his head. Dumbledore knocks at the front door. As the three men go inside, the back door opens. Quickly, they run into the forest and observe themselves and Ron leave the cottage and hide behind the pumpkins. Pushing aside a branch, Hermione stares at herself in the past. The branch springs back. Hermione and Harry watch themselves and Ron run back up the hill, then they creep back into the garden. They peer towards the cottage. Crows peck at Harry's feet as he steals across the garden. Harry bows to Buckbeak, who lowers his head in return. Harry stretches towards the post where Buckbeak is chained. A crow pecks his hand as he undoes the chain. Buckbeak won't move. Harry hauls on the chain. Hermione throws the ferret. Buckbeak follows them into the forest. Fudge turns. The Executioner raises his axe and splits a pumpkin in frustration. Harry and Hermione use the dead ferrets to lure Buckbeak deeper and deeper into the safety of the forest. Leaving the hippogriff in a clearing, they run out of the trees until they see the Whomping Willow in the distance, flailing its branches. Lupin points his wand and the tree falls still. He goes down under the roots. Snape follows Lupin. They sit down beside each other on the grass. As darkness falls, a swarm of bats flutters through the forest.",
    "1191": "Harry jumps up onto the bed, and the book scurries underneath in a flurry of torn paper. He lies down and peers under the bed. The book lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that before sliding back under the bed. Harry quickly unties his shoelace and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed, then drops his shoe onto the floor. The book hurtles out, snapping its covers, and Harry jumps onto the book with both feet. In the corridor, a maid knocks at the room next door. Harry goes downstairs where a ginger cat chases a rat down the corridor. They pass a wanted poster for Sirius Black. At the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat. A man is asleep in a compartment, and Harry slides the door closed. Steam billows from the funnel as the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake. Harry peers along the corridor. The door slides shut, and the lights go out. Ron stares out of the window into the rain. The Express has stopped on a viaduct, and one by one, the carriages go dark. The train lurches again, and the air has turned so cold that they can see their breath. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the glass. Ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water. He is still asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. The train lurches again, and Hermione shivers. Something appears out in the corridor, floating towards the door, something black, shapeless and mysterious. It reaches out. The door slides open and a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaches around it into the compartment. A hooded black shape looms in the doorway. Hermione's cat spits, and Ron's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat. The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces Harry. He stares helplessly at the terrifying creature. It seems to draw the energy out of him. His body goes stiff. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure. In a flash of light, it hurtles backwards and disappears. Harry loses consciousness. Harry opens his eyes and is lying on the seat. Hermione hands him his glasses and he puts them on. Looking confused, Harry takes the piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. He gets up, turns and smiles. Ron and Hermione stare at Harry. He looks at the rain teeming down outside the window and stares at his own worried face reflected in the glass. Horseless carriages take the students up to Hogwarts Castle. They assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast. Lighted candles hang above their heads as they sit at the long tables listening to the choir.",
    "1193": "Hagrid lifts Harry down. Malfoy struts forward. Buckbeak rears and attacks Malfoy. Hagrid lifts Malfoy up. As Hagrid carries Malfoy away, the hippogriff gently nudges Harry. He strokes its beak. Back at Hogwarts, a ghostly knight crashes through a window carrying a severed head. A headless horseman follows him through the Great Hall. Harry stares at the picture of Sirius Black in the newspaper. He sees a raging man with wild, staring eyes struggling violently with his prison guards. A foxglove grows in stony ground. A Dementor floats past. Frost appears on the petals and the flower immediately dies. A wardrobe. He whispers to Neville. The wardrobe door slowly opens and Professor Snape steps out. Snape is dressed as an old lady with a red handbag. Ron is pushed to the front. Ron steps forward, reluctantly. Snape becomes a huge, black spider. Ron's hair stands on end as it moves towards him, clicking its pincers. He reaches for his wand. It wears roller-skates. It sprawls across the floor. Parvarti faces a huge cobra. A jack in the box. Harry steps forward. Lupin watches him closely. A hideous Dementor. Lupin jumps in front of him. A full moon appears, half hidden by clouds. The moon becomes a balloon. It zooms around the classroom and back into the wardrobe. Ron and Hermione follow the other students, leaving Harry alone in the quadrangle. Harry talks to Professor Lupin. Harry grins, proudly. On the staircase. The other portraits are distraught. Weeping and wailing, the painted characters run from picture to picture. Dumbledore and Filch, the caretaker, stare at the empty painting. Dumbledore runs his finger across the slashed canvas as Filch looks around, suspiciously. In a picture of the African plains, the fat lady hides behind a hippopotamus. The heavy portcullis is lowered. The huge gates are closed and firmly secured by a system of strong iron locks, which swing neatly into place, one after the other. The Dementors keep guard outside the school as all of the students sleep in the Great Hall. Harry is wide-awake and listening. On the ceiling of the Great Hall, a star shoots across the celestial sky. A single autumn leaf flutters down from the Whomping Willow, then all the leaves fall at once and the tree shakes its bare branches. Snape enters the classroom and closes the shutters with his wand. He pulls down a screen. They open their books. Malfoy has his arm in a sling. He taps a projector and turns Ron's pages. Malfoy throws Harry an animated cartoon of Harry being hit on the head in a Quidditch match. An umbrella is whirled aloft by a gale force wind. Around the Quidditch pitch, sodden spectators stand in the driving rain, cheering their teams.",
    "1196": "Harry sees something swirling around inside the crystal ball, moves closer and peers into the mist, seeing the face of Sirius Black. A hand claps him on the shoulder. Bemused, Professor Trelawney gazes at Harry. With a worried look on his face, he runs out of the room and hurries away down the circular staircase. Outside, in a ruined part of the castle, crows alight on the fallen masonry. Harry, Hermione and Ron peer through a ruined archway, seeing a man wearing a black hood sharpening the curved blade of a huge axe. They leave the school, walk through the cloister and into the grounds. Malfoy and his cronies are on the slope above Hagrid's cottage. Furious, Hermione threatens Malfoy, her wand at his throat. He's terrified, but as she turns away, Malfoy smirks. She turns back and punches him full in the face. Malfoy and his cronies make a run for it. She smiles at Ron. Ron, Harry and Hermione run down the steep steps cut into the grassy slope towards Hagrid's cottage. They find him gazing sadly out of the window at Buckbeak, who is chained to a post in the pumpkin patch. A line of dead ferrets is hanging nearby. He feeds a small creature, then opens a small blue tin and takes out Ron's rat. Another pebble hits Harry. They look out of the window and see Fudge, Dumbledore and the Executioner making their way towards the cottage. He ushers them out. They peer out of the back door. At the front door, Hagrid welcomes his guests. Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the cottage and run down the garden path. They hide behind a huge pile of giant orange pumpkins. A crow lands beside them as they anxiously watch the cottage. Hermione spins round and peers into the forest. They run as fast as they can away from the cottage and up the grassy slope. Buckbeak watches them go. Harry glances back at the hippogriff still chained to a post in the pumpkin patch, then he follows his friends. Halfway up the hill, they stop and look back towards the cottage. Smoke rises from the stone chimney. Dumbledore, Fudge and Hagrid come out of the cottage with the Executioner. He walks across the garden, carrying his sharp axe over his shoulder, moving through the pumpkin patch towards Buckbeak. They watch horrified as the Executioner raises his axe. The huge blade swings down. Hermione hides her face on Ron's shoulder, putting her arms around his neck. Suddenly, Ron drops his rat, blood on his finger. Ron chases the rat. Harry and Hermione follow Ron. Ron catches Scabbers and slumps down near the Whomping Willow with its twisted trunk.",
    "1197": "Ron points his shaking hand. The huge, black dog leaps over their heads, grabs Ron's leg, and drags him towards the tree. Still holding Scabbers, Ron is dragged under the roots. Harry makes a grab for him but a branch knocks Harry and Hermione over. The Whomping Willow waves its branches menacingly. Cautiously, they move towards it and the tree attacks them. A branch lashes down and Harry loses his glasses. Hermione jumps over a swinging branch, but the next one lifts her off the ground. Harry rolls over as the tree lashes out and he sprints off into flailing branches as Hermione is whirled above his head. Scratched by the sharp twigs, Hermione is twisted this way and that as she clings to the branch. She is turned upside down. Harry finds his glasses and puts them on to see Hermione flying towards him. Desperately, she grabs hold of his T-shirt. He is hauled into the air. They hurtle around until Hermione lets go and Harry falls down the hole under the tree roots. Hermione lands on top of him. Ahead of them is a flight of steps cut into the twisted roots. They start to climb and Harry and Hermione climb up through a trapdoor under bare floorboards. A faint light filters through wooden shutters. They go up a rickety staircase and along a dingy landing into a dilapidated room. Huge paw prints on the dusty floor lead across the room to a wild-eyed man with matted hair and a ragged convict's uniform. Hermione stands in front of Harry. Pushing Hermione aside, Harry knocks the man down and threatens him with his wand. Harry's wand flies out of his hand. Professor Lupin helps Sirius to his feet. The children stare, horrified, as Sirius embraces him. Lupin narrows his eyes and looks from Sirius to Harry, then gives Sirius his wand. Snape enters. Harry slides Hermione's wand from her pocket and Snape flies backwards. Sirius grabs the rat. It runs across the piano and scurries towards a rat hole. Lupin and Sirius wave their wands and drag out a pudgy little man with sharp, pointed teeth. He rubs his beady little eyes. One finger on his left hand is missing. He tries to run but they stop him. Pettigrew grabs Harry but he is pulled away. Pettigrew sinks to his knees. Harry and Sirius help Ron out from the hole under the tree. Hermione sits beside him. Sirius gazes towards the distant lights of Hogwarts. Harry watches Sirius anxiously. Lupin appears with Pettigrew and pulls him away. Hermione points to the sky. A full moon appears from behind the clouds. They all stare at Professor Lupin. As the moonlight touches his face, his eyes turn green and his face distorts.",
    "1204": "Marley's lying next to Connor, then watches him leave and settles back down next to the sleeping lad. He leaves the editor's glass-fronted office. The children are playing ball in the garden with Jenny when John arrives home. The kids, Jenny and Marley tackle him to the ground. John, the boys and Marley head back to the house. Marley's having difficulty getting up the steps. Marley's asleep in the dining room. The windy dog gets up and trots out. John puts on a coat and goes back outside. They use torches to search the rainy night. Jenny switches the light on in the barn. The children are gathered together at a window. She picks up Colleen with a reassuring smile. Patrick glumly follows his mother as John continues to search outside. He walks down the drive towards the post box by the roadside. He flashes the torch around and spots Marley lying by a tree. The dog whines as John touches his belly. A white-coated vet washes her hands. Close to tears, John leaves the surgery. He steps out onto the street, shrugging on his jacket and walks, shoulders slumped, towards the car. He puts the key in the door and puts his hands on his hips and sighs. Later, he arrives home. She looks at the scrapbook and grins. Resting his cheek on his right hand, John doesn't look at her and examines his other hand, distractedly. Jenny puts an arm around him. He stares at the scrapbook of pasted-in columns. Morning sun shines on the big stone house. John's asleep, slumped over the scrapbook. He turns to Jenny and smiles. She slumps against a door frame in relief. Marley bounds across the large lawn and sits down by the road. As the school bus approaches, Marley trots up to the bus as Patrick and Connor get off. Marley joins in the race. John and Billy walk through town past the tall clock tower of City Hall. Sebastian and John grin broadly at one another. John looks back as they part. Sebastian approaches two women. John drops his bag on a chair by the front door near to a baby grand piano. There's a note on the dining room table. Marley's knocked over the dustbin in the kitchen and is having a feast. He picks up the bin and they go for a walk through a sunny meadow bordered by trees with golden autumnal leaves. Marley trots along beside John, who has his hands thrust in his pockets. They sit down together on the path. John strokes Marley and studies his old friend. The dog turns and looks at him. They sit, side by side, in the golden evening sun, looking out over the lush valley.",
    "1205": "Lights burn in the house at night. He's lying by the fire. He lies down next to Marley. Jenny fetches a blanket for the pair. Marley's lying under a tree. He gets out of the car and runs indoors. Connor gives him a hug. Jenny fights back tears. John takes the stuffed lamb and Patrick tearfully hugs Marley. The boy looks imploringly at his parents. Jenny frowns in sympathy at her son's pain, and John tries a reassuring smile. He carries Marley out to the car and gently lays the old dog down in the boot. John goes to get behind the wheel as Jenny tearfully strokes her dying pet. She closes the door and presses her hand to the glass as John drives away down the winding drive through trees adorned with golden brown autumn leaves. At the surgery, John sits and waits with his hands clasped together. At home, Patrick's leafing through John's old columns. Jenny walks in and ruffles his blonde hair. Jenny controls her own emotions as John gives into tears. He goes back into the surgery where Marley is lying on the table. He runs his hand down Marley's beige coat. He strokes the dog's tail, which isn't wagging now. He holds a rear paw and rubs Marley's shoulder, then leans forward and hugs his friend, burying his face in Marley's neck. He gently strokes Marley's head. Jenny waits tearfully at home. The vet puts a hypodermic into the IV line going into Marley's leg. Patrick slots a videotape into a player. Jenny waves to the camera holding baby Patrick in a cowboy outfit. Marley stands expectantly next to the high chair. Jenny slips him a tidbit. Patrick stares at the TV. At the surgery, the vet pushes down the plunger on the needle. John watches Marley and Jenny sits sadly, staring into space. On the video, John takes off Patrick's nappy, which Marley then grabs. Patrick grins, watching as his father tries to wrestle the nappy off the dog. Jenny sits sadly in the window seat. Patrick concentrates on the old video footage of his mother laughing and a close up of Marley, staring puzzled into the camera. The vet puts a stethoscope to Marley's chest and listens. John continues to stroke Marley's head as the vet takes off the stethoscope and turns away. The Grogans walk across their leaf-strewn lawn, John carrying Colleen on his shoulders. He lifts down the little girl as they reach a small grave by a tree. She puts the picture in the grave. He puts his paper in with Colleen's. She takes off her necklace and kneels down next to the grave. She drops the necklace in with Marley.",
    "1208": "Michael climbs a wooden ladder and cuts the rope securing a door, pulling it open. He is nearest the door as Rambo removes the blindfold and leaves, passing the footless corpse of a crucified man. At the dance show, a soldier takes a drag from a cigarette, stands, and throws the butt at the dancing girls. A woman raises her arm to protect herself as the soldier raises his arms in triumph. Another soldier throws liquid at them, making the women cower. Meanwhile, Diaz creeps between two huts and is surprised by Rambo waiting there. Rambo beckons to him. At the dance, a soldier with a can of booze climbs onto the stage grinning, slaps one of the girls on the rump, causing her to lurch forward as the soldiers jump and wave their arms ecstatically. Lewis runs past a hut with his weapon primed. Two guards in ponchos walk over a wooden bridge, with Rambo taking cover in the timbers beneath it. The soldier on stage continues to humiliate a terrified dancing woman by pouring his can of drink over her head. Rambo wades up the stream, which rises to meet the ground of the camp and is bordered by bushes. A soldier emerges from a hut onto a veranda, angles a lamp above his head to illuminate them, carries a spirit-type bottle of golden-brown booze, swigs from it, goes inside, emerges once more, plants his hands on his head, and heads away across the sodden compound. BN sneaks up to the cage, breaks open a chain on the door, and motions the women to follow him quietly. Rambo continues upstream and, yards from its end, spots a Burmese soldier pushing a young boy in front of him. Rambo ducks out of sight as they go by. The dance event descends into chaos as the soldier on stage slams one of the women to the stage floor, picks her up, and throws her over the arms of his fellows below, who begin to tear at her clothes. One trooper fights the others off and leads the girl away, keeping his comrades at arms' length. The boy is pushed into another hut where the commander is sitting, with the door remaining open. The commander walks up to the boy and inspects him, wearing a tunic decorated with ribbons, open to reveal a white vest and dog tags underneath. The commander strokes the boy's head, and Rambo looks away in disgust as the door closes. Rambo emerges from hiding, checks his watch showing three minutes to two. Diaz hops over a timber fence and runs up the ladders to the volunteers' cage.",
    "1211": "They head into the forest with BN now leading the escapees as they mount a rise. Lewis treads on a hidden land mine. Diaz clamps a hand over his mouth while more troops dismount from the back of the lorry, which then moves on. Louis is wide-eyed in shock as Diaz whispers to him and Reese looks about. Michael cuts at the bloody wound while Louis bites on a cloth. Soldiers get off a lorry with the tracker dogs, which are after the scent and lead their handlers in a rapid pursuit, followed by a large body of their colleagues. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run up a rocky slope as she stumbles in the dirt. Rambo runs back to her and helps her up while School Boy moves up front. Michael and the mercenaries carry Lewis on a hastily-constructed stretcher as the dogs lead their handlers. On the rocky path, School Boy stops to listen in a craggy crevice. Rambo starts to tear a strip from Sarah's shirt and ties the strip around his boot. School Boy tosses Rambo an explosive as Lewis' party looks around in horror. The commander's truck stops and via a walkie-talkie, the commander screams orders at an armed patrol boat on the river. The grey patrol boat flies the Burmese flag as the captain signals to his helmsman, who fires up the engine. A handler offers a tracker dog a sniff of clothing. Rambo runs through the undergrowth with a strip of Sarah's clothing on his boot as the troops seem to be gaining on him. He runs through a carpet of dry brown leaves as a lorry pulls into a clearing and more troops dismount. Rambo heads through the forest at full tilt and skids to a halt beside a gnarled tree. He takes the claymore explosive and launches it in the limbs of the roots, then glances in the direction of his pursuers. He rips the clothing strip from his boot and pulls a round metal disc, which is fastened to the body of the mine by a piece of twine which he ties around the cloth. He pulls a priming pin from the bomb and covers the explosive with leaves, then takes off into the forest. The dogs and their handlers halt by the bush as a small dog with beady eyes, tan fur, and a white beard sniffs around leaves and ferns. The handlers look at each other and one of the soldiers looks along the tree. The rusty grey shape of the Tall Boy Missile is lodged in the ground and leaning against the branch. Wide-eyed and terrified, the handlers quickly pull the excited dogs away as a soldier kneels to inspect the ground.",
    "1215": "The men in the boat wear burnt orange robes and have shaved heads. The boat's motor churns up plumes of white foam on the river. Rambo is at the tiller, steering. The boat enters more populated territories with wooden homes on the riverside and harbors made of timber. A building on the riverside features a sign, comprising a large painting of a cobra, on the wall. There is also a Red Cross sign. The boat pulls in at a harbor on which there are two men. They stop what they're doing and turn their attention to the boat. One man wears a white t-shirt and a black hat. The other, a blue shirt and a bandanna. The boat slows to a halt. Rambo and his men disembark from the boat. Rambo's face is doleful and weary. The sun casts an orange glow on the river water. Surrounded by onlookers, a young snake-charmer crouches alone in an open area facing two cobras. One of the cobras rears and strikes at the dark-haired wrangler. A snake merchant approaches Rambo, then his men. The seller gives Rambo cash. Rambo walks away in disgust and heads for the perimeter of the arena. He empties the bag containing the cobra into a wooden crate. A group of Westerners arrive, led by Michael, who has thinning hair, and a blonde girl, Sarah. Michael greets and talks to the merchant, who points to Rambo. Rambo maneuvers a cobra into the crate and slams down the lid. In the arena, the wrangler teases a cobra. Rambo stands near wire and wood snake cages as Michael and his party approach. Rambo throws a rat into one of the cages. Rambo scratches his face idly. Michael seems temporarily lost for words. Rambo leaves. Michael turns to his party. Sarah is mid 20s, pretty with blonde, scraggly hair and a high forehead. She follows Rambo out. He's washing his face and hair in a water barrel. Rambo picks up a towel and wipes his face. He hangs the towel on a hook. He walks up to her and fixes her with a firm stare. Rambo walks away from her. He toils alone in a darkened workshop. The only light comes from sunlight outside and the flames of the fire. He uses a hammer to forge a piece of broken steel on an anvil. The end of it is orange and white with heat. He wipes an arm across his sweaty brow. His blows on the steel become more intense. In darkness, save for the glow of headlights on jeeps and beams from hand torches, the army drag people from their homes and march them away at gunpoint, under the supervision of the cigarette-smoking commander.",
    "1216": "The villagers have their hands behind their heads and find armed men. The soldiers open fire on them as women cry and hide their eyes. Soldiers break into homes and drag out youths while the officer watches coolly. A soldier shoots a man dead and the commander addresses the village. Terrified women cover their mouths. In Rambo's fort, sparks fly as he grinds round blades on a spinning wheel. Veins stand out on his muscular arms. He stops grinding, drops the blade and runs a hand through his hair. A rusty metal fan on a rod lies on a bench nearby. He removes a nut from the rod and discards the fan. He replaces it with his creation, a new fan. He adds a nut to the thread at the end of the rod and reaches onto a bench. He picks up a spanner and tightens the nut. He deftly lifts the assembly off the bench and puts it down. He leaves the workshop and walks out into the night air, where it's raining heavily. His boat is moored below at the water's edge. He looks down at it. A solitary figure sits on the boat. Rambo wipes rain away from his face. He walks down a wooden walkway to the boat. Sarah is sitting under the boat's canopy. She stands. She's soaking wet. He stares blankly at her. Sarah looks disappointed. She emerges from the canopy of the boat and walks past him, climbing onto the harbor. She begins to walk the length of the harbor towards the walkway. She pauses and brushes rain from her head. Rambo steps onto the harbor. She turns and stares at him before walking back towards him with an imploring look. She brushes rain from her hair once more. Rambo stares at her. His face betrays no emotion. She turns away from him with a faint smile and walks back along the harbor. She wears a sodden gray hoodie and jeans. She climbs the wooden walkway. Rambo rubs his chin and runs a hair through his hair, then walks along the harbor. In the morning light, on Rambo's boat as it motors along the river, Michael addresses his party. Rambo is at the tiller. Michael glances at Rambo, who affords him the merest flicker in return. Rambo stoically leans on the tiller with both hands. Sarah approaches him. She smiles and turns away from him. Dusk. The boat motors around a headland. A small white glimmer appears on the river and a cone- shaped reflection in the water. It's thrown by the boat, which has headlamps mounted on its canopy. Michael and his volunteers doze in the boat. Sarah is nestled against Michael's chest. Rambo's attention is caught.",
    "1219": "Volunteer James gives a sermon under a canopy with the aid of a translator. The man with the camcorder records the event. Another volunteer gives medical care. Sarah passes by him and walks up wooden steps into a hut. Young people sit in a waiting area, some with missing limbs. Sarah finds Michael with another patient who lies on the floor of the hut. Sarah hands Michael a roll of bandage. He binds a stump where his shin should be. Michael's patient writhes in pain. Michael gives him a comforting pat. Sarah looks down at them, then at the waiting patients. A very small boy has only one leg. The village is attacked with rocket fire. A rocket is primed. Sarah hands a child to its mother. The rockets are fired by the army. A man is blown to pieces. Michael roams with a child in his arms. Rockets hit the paddy field. A wooden hut is destroyed. Sarah cowers under a hut. The army enter the village with weapons blazing. A volunteer carrying a child in each arm is cut down. The children are dragged from him. One is shot and the other bayoneted in the stomach while his face is held down by an army boot. A woman is shot, another abused and a third dragged away by her hair. In slow motion, a volunteer in a baseball cap tries to outrun the rocket fire. A hit hurls in through the air, severing his legs below the knee. A man kneels before a pair of soldiers with weapons. Soldiers hack off villagers' limbs. A soldier with a flamethrower sends a plume of flame into a building. Villagers with clothing on fire run from it and roll in the dust. A small child is torn from its mother and tossed into the burning building. Sarah runs. Michael is rifle-butted. The villagers run across the paddy field. The truck with a machine gun on a tripod arrives. The villagers are massacred in mid-flight. Sarah is accompanied by a mother and a child who run with her. The mother is shot in the back and drops to the ground. From the truck, the cool commander watches the carnage while his subordinate blazes away. Partially caught by a blast, Sarah tumbles into the water of the field. The commander pulls on his cigarette. More villagers run towards the truck. Their bodies are torn apart by bullets. Gunfire picks off survivors. Sarah looks up just as two of the soldiers grab her by the arms. She tries to fight them off but they haul her to her feet. They drag her away by the scruff of her neck. In the truck, the soldier in charge of the machine gun pivots to and fro in search of victims.",
    "1220": "Corpses litter the remains of a village as huts and trees burn. The commander watches, his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses. Green forests and a misty mountain towering over a lake are nearby. Rambo's boat sits serenely at its home harbor. Rambo sits on the deck with his elbows resting on his knees, toying with the crucifix Sarah gave him in his sinewy hands. He looks up thoughtfully, then stands. Sheets of lightning bombard dark mountaintops as a montage of flashback images of Rambo in combat plays. Rambo lies in a hammock, then climbs out. In the rain-soaked darkness, a figurine silhouette holds an umbrella and stands in the half-light. The figure lowers the brolly and walks towards him. Rambo switches on a light. Marshall, a middle-aged man with neat gray hair and a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt, approaches. Rambo thinks about something and then walks towards him. Rambo beats a piece of hot steel, shoves the metal into burning coals, and douses the white-hot metal in water. The cooling metal is the shape of a machete. On a rainy morning, Reese sings in Rambo's boat, among a motley collection of mercenaries including bearded Diaz and En-Joo, handsome stubbly School Boy, and bald Lewis. Rambo sits at the tiller, watching them, while Lewis stands at the prow of the boat, looking out at the river. Rambo stares at Lewis blankly, and Lewis stares back. Rambo looks vacantly ahead. With an angry glare at Rambo, Lewis returns to the prow of the boat and continues his belligerent surveillance. Rambo gazes out across the water surface as a flock of birds takes off en masse. A watchtower at a military camp surrounded by razor wire is nearby. Troops eat in a large mess tent, one idly throwing leftovers over his shoulder into a cage of female prisoners outside. Three soldiers troop out of the mess hut as the Burmese flag is raised on a pole. Beneath it are two ranks of downcast male prisoners, now army draftees. A drill instructor thumps one in the stomach. The camp huts are timber with above-ground supports as foundations. Sarah lies bound beneath one. The foundation is divided into two sections. In the section next to Sarah, two fat pigs fight over food. Through the slat, she watches a soldier walk away from the hut. The commander and the subordinate have an overview of a larger compound, in which the pigs roam freely. Opposite the soldier's vantage point and above the piggery is a cage in which the downcast male survivors of Michael's party kneel. Their hands are tied behind them, and their faces are muddy. One lifts his head and catches the commander's eye.",
    "1221": "The volunteer looks down while on Rambo's boat. Lewis stands in the stern with his back to Rambo, points to himself, and looks at Rambo, who ignores him. Rambo fixes Lewis a glare but remains expressionless, then turns away and spits into the river before staring ahead again. Lewis walks away in disgust. School Boy glances up the boat at Rambo. At the military camp at night, a truck sits at the end of two rows of huts. In the pigsty cell, Sarah looks up through the floorboards into the hut. The commander appears with a short, neat mustache, takes a pull on one of his ever-present cigarettes, blows smoke, smirks, and walks away. Sarah rests her head against the wall of her prison. On the river, the boat rounds a promontory with its headlamps off. Lewis leans pensively on the boat's prow, turns to look at the stern where Rambo stares back at him, then turns away. The boat pulls alongside the harbor where Michael's party were dropped. The mercenaries disembark laden with various weapons and bandoleers, including automatic rifles with telescopic sights. Two rebels approach along the path leading to the gangplank. Rambo walks up the gangplank. The party of mercenaries, BN the rebel, and the boy tracker set off into the forest. Rambo solemnly watches them go, then turns away and walks back to the boat. BN and the boy lead the mercenaries through forest undergrowth. School Boy's rifle is particularly bulky. They cross a small stream. En-Joo wears a khaki hat and Diaz has a shirt covering his hair. Resting against a tree and partially covered in vines is a dull gray object, bullet shaped but with fins at one end. Lewis regards it warily, but the rest of the mercenaries pay the bomb little attention and move on. They pass a cave mouth on a craggy mountainside. Inside, there's a small collection of nervous-looking locals, comprising women, children, and old men. The mercenaries move on, with En-Joo, Reese, and Diaz each giving the locals a backward glance. At the village paddy field, the water is clear but there is a pale brown mud beneath it. Sticks of plant poke into the air and trees are reflected in the water's surface. A decomposing human corpse lies partially submerged in the water and a dead buffalo lies beyond it. BN and the mercenaries overlook the field. More corpses lie at the edge of the field. Reese holds his shirt against his nose. A woman's severed head hangs from a post. Lewis turns to look. There are two bodies hanging from bare rafters in the remains of a hut. The boy nods and leaves. The mercenaries make a wary record of the ruined village.",
    "1229": "Emily is wheeled down a hospital corridor on a gurney. Dr. Briar comes to see her in an operating room, where Emily, anesthetized and wearing a theater cap, lies on the operating table. A square of her chest is bare beneath a sheet. Meanwhile, Dan weeps. A surgeon lifts Tim's heart out of his body and carefully passes it to a colleague. A medic opens the door of the operating room to let in another medic who is carrying Tim's heart, which is in a stainless steel bowl. Dr. Briar and her colleagues are operating on Emily. A golden, dream-like image of Emily and Tim sitting in the shade of a tree and entwining their fingers. Emily's new heart lies still in the open cavity of her chest. Dr. Briar looks up at the monitor, which is flat-lining. The heart begins to beat. Emily lies peacefully on the operating table, eyes closed. The real Ben sits miserably in Tim's motel room, staring at a wall of newspaper cuttings about the crash. There are also photos of the people Tim helped and an article on Ezra. Ben sifts through envelopes, each of which has the name of a person Tim wanted to help, including Ben's. Ben hands Emily a list of the people written on the back of a photo of Sarah. Ben hands Emily a photo. The photo shows Tim standing at Holly's hospital bedside. In her garden, Emily weeps as she reads Tim's letter to her. Glum and pensive, Emily lies in a bathtub. Emily's head and shoulders are framed by the water in the tub. Emily slowly submerges herself so that her ears are beneath the water. Emily lies with her eyes closed, listening. Wearing a delicate summer dress, Emily walks in a sunny park. She approaches a children's choir singing in the open to an audience of adults who clap along. Ezra is playing the piano. Emily watches and looks moved. When the songs ended, Ezra points the audience's standing applause towards the choir. Ezra rises and bows, then gestures to the choir again. Emily watches intensely through wide, gentle eyes. She cranes her neck to keep track of Ezra as he leaves the stage and moves effortlessly towards members of the audience. Emily walks over to Ezra as he chats to some of the children in passing. He turns to her confidently. He's no longer blind. Emily shakes her head. Her eyes begin to fill with tears and glisten. Emily nods and blinks back tears. Light dawns in Ezra's eyes. He smiles gently. Emily smiles through her tears, which roll down her cheeks. Ezra gazes at her incredulously. He shakes her hand. Another big tear rolls down Emily's cheek.",
    "1230": "Ben's smart saloon pulls up outside an olive green clapboard house with a white picket fence. A black and white Great Dane stands barking at him in the garden. Ben gets out of the car and locks it with a remote. Dressed in a smart suit and tie, Ben goes to the fence but stops short and stares at the dog. A neighbor who is gardening spots him. Ben parks on an upper story of a car park, which looks onto St. Matthew Medical Center. Ben enters the center and goes to a blonde middle-aged woman on the reception desk. Ben's in a lift. He stands aside as two doctors wearing stethoscopes get in with him. Ben holds back the door. Emily gets in. They all face the front. Then Ben turns and studies Emily for a long moment. His expression concerned. Emily, who is slender and wearing a nightdress, gets out of the lift and walks listlessly down a hospital corridor. Ben waits and stops the lift door closing with the briefcase he's carrying. He gets out of the lift and follows Emily at a discreet distance. He stops at double doors and looks through the glass panes in them. He sees Emily, who is wearing UGG boots with her nighty, shuffle down onto a ward. Ben follows her. Emily's image blurs. She passes a reception desk, then rounds a corner and disappears. Ben approaches the desk. Ben smiles and gives the stout nurse a brief wave as he heads away. His smile fades as he walks. A clip attached to Emily's forefinger attaches her to an electrocardiograph machine. 30-something Emily lies asleep in her hospital bed in shadowy light. Ben stands in the doorway watching her intently. His expression sad. As she stirs, Ben makes a swift but calm exit. Emily glimpses him. She sits up and stares after him. Emily frowns and looks puzzled. Ben's car is parked in the dark, wet night. He sits at the wheel, deep in solemn thought as the wipers sweep back and forth. Ben addresses colleagues in a small conference room at Apogee Aeronautics. He points to a rocket model. Ben checks a message on his BlackBerry. Ben drives a Corvette sports car. He enters the beach house and puts down his things. She's on the patio, looking out to sea. Ben lies lethargically on his couch, staring at his mobile phone on the coffee table. He picks the mobile up. Ben snaps his mobile shut and throws it down. Ben drives his saloon along the sunny coast road from the beach house. He pulls up in a parking spot outside a large institutional-looking building with the stars and stripes hanging over the door.",
    "1235": "Ezra sits playing the piano in the foyer of a modern glass and steel mall as people of all different ages mill about, going about their business. Ben stands in a shop doorway, watching Ezra play, looking deeply moved and appearing to drift off into his own thoughts. Meanwhile, a couple cuddles and giggles in a diner nearby, where Ezra, a man in his 40s with an aquiline nose and longish brown hair, sits at a table, sipping from a mug. A pretty, blonde waitress speaks to him as Ben sits watching nearby. The waitress, Susan, walks off and Ben watches sympathetically, then gets up, throws money down onto his table, and saunters up to Ezra's table. Ezra, unaware of Ben standing over him, sips his drink then self-consciously smooths down his hair, his blue eyes clouded. A look of surprise crosses Ezra's face as Ben looks down at the pie on a plate in front of Ezra and then goes away. Later, Ben sits watching a single box jellyfish float in his aquarium in the motel, motionless in the shadowy room, then goes to pick up his mobile, checks the display and slowly opens it up. Meanwhile, Emily, in hospital, lies in bed with air tubes running from her nose, fiddling with a card, holding her mobile away from her and looking at it briefly. Ben walks down a corridor, leaves his motel, and walks in the night as Emily snuggles down in the bed, her smile fading, then closing her eyes and smiling again. Her eyes open again as she blinks and begins to look drowsy. Phone to his ear, Ben walks towards the main door of the St. Matthew Center, the glass doors slide apart and he enters, walking down a hospital corridor towards Emily's room, stopping outside to look at her through the window. Emily lies fast asleep, surrounded by machines and monitors, on her side with her ear pressed against her phone, which lies on a pillow beneath her. Ben closes his clamshell mobile phone, slowly and gently pulls the phone out and shuts it, placing it on the bed. He draws up a chair and sits at her bedside, staring down at her peaceful, but bruised face as she continues sleeping peacefully. Waking up, Emily blinks drowsily and rubs her eyes as she slowly comes to, sitting up a little, then freezing and sitting up fully, staring down at Ben, who is slumped back in the chair beside her bed, fast asleep. Removing the oxygen tubes from her nose, Emily watches Ben, then slowly reaches out and caresses the back of one of his hands with her fingertips.",
    "1242": "He jabs his finger as Peter stands by, frowning. They watch Longson march off. On a dark, rain-sodden pitch, Bremner, in a yellow Leeds shirt, slides down a Derby player. Leeds players foul and head-butt their counterparts. Brian bellows at Don. Bremner strolls up to Brian and shakes his hand on the touchline. Bremner smirks. Brian and Peter are dazed in the rain as the Leeds players trudge off, gesticulating at the Derby crowd. Longson stalks angrily down the corridor, past the away dressing room, to stand beside a hangdog Brian surveying his battered team. Longson glares at Brian, then turns on his heel, leaving a rueful Brian to meet Peter's concerned look. Brian addresses the press assembled in the tunnel of Juve's Comunale Stadium. Brian jabs his finger at a camera. Nurses wheel a gurney from an ambulance. Brian sits by Peter's hospital bedside. Brian smiles and looks away. Their eyes meet and hold a loaded look for a moment, before each drops his gaze. Brian storms into the Derby board meeting. Longson stares at the table as he smokes a cigar, while the other directors look away from Brian's plaintive looks. Shaking his head in disbelief, Brian wanders down to Longson, then hurls his tracksuit top on the table. Everyone gathered in the candlelit room turns to look at Peter. Brian crosses the room to Peter. Brian stands beside three grinning young men before the assembled press below the Leeds United sign in front of the stadium. Giles, Bremner, and Hunter watch from the training ground. Now, Brian passes them in the tunnel. Brian stands with his back to the pitch in the players' tunnel. Brian smiles bitterly as Giles points past him, towards the empty stadium at the end of the tunnel. Brian's smile wilts as Giles turns and saunters off with the other players, who pat him on the back as they go. Alone, Brian turns slowly and makes his way up towards the pitch, gazing at the empty stands. Alone in his stark hotel room, Brian lies on his bed, smoking and drinking. He's staring at the little girl playing noughts and crosses with the toy clown on the television test-card. A woman rides a tricycle past beach huts on the seafront promenade. Girls flock across the beach by the pier. An elderly couple eat fish and chips. More middle-aged folks snooze in deck chairs in the hazy sunshine. Brian pulls up with Peter in his Ford Zodiac on the seafront. They stroll along the seafront passing a woman, hobbling with a Zimmer frame. Brian's eyes drift away as he frowns. Peter points over the street to a hotel. In the bar, the Brighton Chairman extends his hand to shake.",
    "1243": "Brian smiles wryly with his arms folded, then leans forward to shake the chairman's hand. Later, at a crowded tourist beach by a Majorcan hotel, bare-chested Brian plays football with his kids, while Peter cavorts around with them. Fat holiday-makers laze on lounges nearby, and Brian kisses Peter's cheek playfully as a man smears cream over his obese folds. Brian holds his arms aloft to celebrate scoring, and Barbara frolics in the surf with Peter and the kids. Wearing aviator shades, Brian nods smiling and is beckoned to join them. His face becomes sober as he turns over to the back page of the paper to see the sport headline. By the hotel, a waiter points Brian out to a man in a panama hat and blazer. The middle-aged man wanders down the sandy beach carrying a briefcase towards Brian, who is now lying on his back in the sun. The man in the blazer dabs sweat from his face as he stands over Brian. Still wearing his shades and an intrigued expression, Brian raises himself up onto his elbows, looking up at Archer. Peter marches off along the jetty away from Brian, leaving him pacing furiously, hands on hips then on his head in despair.\n\nAt a home game, a Luton Town player in orange stripe weaves through the lead-footed Leeds midfield. Bremner sulks beside Clough on the bench, and behind them, Don makes his way to a seat with the directors, eyeing Brian gloatingly. A Luton striker scores, and the Leeds fans cheer as Brian escorts his team down the tunnel. Brian finds Cussins waiting, and the Leeds players trudge into their dressing room. Cussins leaves Brian with his hands on his hips, and Brian makes to follow Bremner into the dressing room but has the door slammed in his face. The players, now showered and in their fashionable clothes, join the directors in the long, narrow lounge. Brian traipses in last to face Cussins, and a player obliges. Cussins eyeballs Brian, then turns to the players. Brian wrinkles his nose with distaste as Bremner, sat beside Giles, winks at him. Brian nods and swallows hard, looking troubled as their manager steps into the corridor. Jimmy finds Brian outside the door, and Manny Cussins is in the board room. Brian smarts, straightens his jacket, and glances around the board members. Cussins glances at the other directors, and Brian leads Nigel down the corridor, passing Don's photo.\n\nBrian's in makeup for Yorkshire TV when the presenter knocks on the door. Brian winks and smiles wistfully. In the studio, the floor manager leads Brian to his seat before the cameras, and Brian notices two other chairs. Brian sits, and the tall handsome presenter leads a bullish Don through the dark studio into the lights of the set.",
    "1244": "Don sits in the chair to Brian's left, the presenter to Brian's right. Brian shoots a scathing look at the presenter while Don smooths out his tie. The floor manager points at the presenter as Brian's grin sticks. Brian fades to silhouette as the lights dim, then nods bitterly as Don and the presenter rise from their seats and stroll away across the studio floor. Still sat in his chair, brooding introspectively, Brian glances over at the TV crew who wander out of the cavernous studio as the lights go out. Brian sits in the darkness on set, the switched off cameras pointing away from him. Brian drives past Elland Road in his Blue Merc with Nigel and Simon in the back. The lads read comics and annuals as Brian broods at the wheel. He looks in the mirror at them as the boys swap wide-eyed looks on the back seat. Brian smiles as the boys stifle giggles. The boys huddle close behind Brian, excitedly. They arrive at the chalk cliffs of the south coast where girls wheel over the Brighton Promenade in the sunshine. Brian stops the car outside a large red brick house. Peter is wandering among the shrubs and plants in his front garden and looks over at Brian in his car. He stoops over a flowerbed. His eyes fixed on Peter, Brian gets out wearing a heavy frown. Still bent over the flowerbed, Peter glances over at Brian then carries on weeding. Brian puts his hands in his pockets as he strolls up the drive. Peter shoots Brian a withering look, then looks down at his plants. He steps back with his hands on his hips, admiring them. Eventually, he turns to Brian with disdain, then turns back around. Peter takes a step closer to kneeling Brian, scrutinizing him, then points at Brian. The boys exchange puzzled looks in the car. Peter walks closer and stops, then strolls towards his house, then turns back. Brian fixes Peter with a sincere, imploring look. Peter looks at Brian, then hangs his head and shakes it. He rubs the finger of his clenched fists together, then raises his open hands out towards Brian. Brian stands and walks towards his old friend. Brian throws his arms around Peter and hugs him close. Peter screws his eyes up and returns the embrace, then scowls. Brian is wide eyed as he speaks into Peter's ear. Peter blinks slowly and shakes his head. A tender smile spreads across Brian's face. He tightens his embrace and closes his eyes. They step back and look at each other. Peter thumps Brian's shoulder playfully, then nods over Brian's shoulder towards the boys in the car. Brian beckons to them and the boys scamper to Peter.",
    "1245": "She wipes mist off her bathroom mirror and brushes her teeth. Elsewhere in New York City, some very fashionable ladies are also getting dressed, putting on expensive-looking designer underwear. Andy roots through a jumbled drawer and pulls out a serviceable pair of white pants. One of the women, a fashionable blonde, selects a jacket from her extensive walk-in wardrobe, while another lady carefully coordinates her brown top with just the right skirt. The fashionable ladies put on their designer make up working to achieve a flawless finish. In contrast, pretty Andy has put on a comfortable-looking mauve jumper over a white shirt and trousers, and dabs on a bit of lip gloss. The fashionable ladies make their jewelry selections, while Andy consults her appointment book. Andy flips through some political articles she wrote for the university newspaper. The well-dressed ladies pull on their high-heeled shoes and boots. Andy kisses scruffy boyfriend Nate goodbye as he sits reading in bed. The fashionable ladies scoop up their designer phones and bags and leave their swanky uptown apartments. Unfashionable Andy, who is slender and has long, dark hair, walks out of her downtown apartment followed by a gaggle of young schoolchildren out on a trip. A model-type measures out a small amount of cereal and adds some nuts to her breakfast. Andy stops at a bakery and walks down the street, unashamedly munching on an onion bagel. The fashionable ladies flag down taxicabs and get into chauffeur-driven cars, whilst Andy heads cheerfully down into the subway in her rather shapeless brown coat and clunky black heels. Andi makes her way down a busy city street, as smartly dressed businesspeople dash this way and that. Skyscrapers loom overhead on either side of the street. She arrives at a tall building housing Elias-Clark Publications and gazes up at its impressive facade. Clutching her battered, brown leather briefcase, she takes a deep breath and walks into the marble-floored reception hall and up to the desk. An elegant redhead is waiting. Andy follows Emily. Emily's BlackBerry. Emily springs into action as a sleek, silver car pulls up outside. Creative director Nigel leaves. Andy checks her onion breath. A chauffeur-driven car pulls up outside the building. Chic, grey-haired Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly gets out, carrying a designer handbag and a mockup of the magazine. Emily dashes into Miranda's office, puts a glass down on her desk, and fills it with mineral water. Andy watches a member of the editorial staff quickly binning her breakfast, and another changing her shoes. A woman uses a webcamming feature on her computer to touch up her makeup. Emily arranges a pile of magazines on Miranda's desk before quickly tidying up her own.",
    "1247": "Andy goes in and leans on the desk, then pokes her forehead. Her face brightens and he reads her smile. In a huge clothes storeroom, made over and looking fabulous with her freshly fringed glossy hair and an elegant black jacket and trousers on, Andy strides past Serena and Emily and gets the phone. Emily glares at Serena. Meanwhile, Nate leaves the restaurant he chefs in, pulls on his jacket, and heads down the street, walking straight past Andy, who is leaning against a car waiting for him. He stops and looks back, taking in her new look from top to toe: the Chanel boots, the slinky jacket, the gold necklaces, the lipstick, and the sleek hairdo. Andy walks to the subway wearing a stylish green coat and shades, with white gloves on and a cute bag. Another day, she walks in the same boots with a black coat on, an orange hat, and a different designer handbag. Now, she emerges from the subway in a white coat to match her beat cap with yet another desirable handbag on her shoulder. Andy runs into work across the foyer in heels and a chic black coat, her dark hair scooped up in a bun. Now, wearing a gorgeous flowing black outfit with knee-length boots and a long pendant necklace, Andy's arranging magazines on Miranda's desk when Miranda arrives. Miranda takes in Andy's outfit and then continues her call. Nate dough and Lily are in her restaurant, and there's a bag for Lily. Andy's mates giggle as she walks out. Andy gets out of the back of a sleek black car and makes her way to a loft in a fashionable apartment building. She rings the bell. Andy sashays down the hall in her black outfit with a big pendant necklace and approaches a sophisticated-looking couple. He hands her a black portfolio. They go to the bar, and Suave James hands her a glass. He goes, and a handsome curly-haired guy approaches Andy. Andy puts down her glass, smiles, and takes her leave. Christian watches her go. Miranda's in her office going through James Holt's portfolio. She's wearing a crisp black suit and her shock of grey-white hair is expertly coiffured. In the anteroom, Emily points at Andy, who hurries into the office in a smart black mini dress with white colors and cuffs. Miranda purses her lips at James' red dress. Leaving the showroom, Andy follows Miranda. Back at the office, the key is mentioned. Emily approaches Andy's desk. A car drops Andy off, and Andy does so. Andy falters in the foyer as there are three closet doors to choose from. There are various different tables in the foyer, all with flowers on them. Andy looks up the spiral staircase and sees the twins looking over the banister rail on an upper level.",
    "1249": "Emily is standing on the stairs with another couple and spots Andy. Inside at the benefit, Emily and Andy follow Miranda around as she greets guests, prompting her as to who they are. Miranda is wearing a black, off-the-shoulder gown. Andy spots Chairman Irv Ravitz with a chic lady on his arm. A tissue. A man waves at Miranda and turns to Emily. Andy steps back. Emily looks gratefully at Andy, who smiles. Later, Andy is hurrying out of the benefit when she meets Christian coming up the steps. Christian heads into the benefit. Andy is being driven home through the busy New York streets. Andy finds Nate watching TV alone. Andy shuts the door, puts down her bags and walks over to him, carrying a single fairy cake with a lit candle on it. Dark-haired Nate looks morose. He sits forward. He stops in the doorway and turns back to look at her, shaking his head sadly. Hanging his head, he turns and mooches off into the bedroom. Looking glum, Andy blows out the candle on the cake. Andy lets herself into Miranda's townhouse, carrying Miranda's dry cleaning and the book. She's wearing a cool monochrome outfit with black trousers and pale boots and a big, floppy cap on her head. She puts the dry cleaning into the correct closet and is about to leave the book when Andy is being summoned from one of the other rooms, but she can't see Miranda. She yanks her cap off and smooths her fringe before heading in. Miranda is in a chair in the lounge. Andy hands it to her. Miranda rises, sternly. Andy looks down. Miranda has turned her attention to the book. Andy stands and stares at her with her big doe eyes for a moment, then leaves. Andy strolls sadly through the city, mulling over her decision. It's dark and the swanky shop windows she passes are all lit up. She passes people sitting at tables outside a restaurant. She shakes her head and moves on. Yellow taxicabs pass her on the street as she walks past shop windows, one displaying a fashionable red coat. Back at home, Nate wanders out of the bedroom and finds Andy looking through some of her old articles and photographs, including one of her with her parents. She picks up another photograph. Nate's shoulders sag and he heads back into the bedroom and turns out the light. Andy rubs her neck, trying to ease some of the tension. Andy is at work early. Miranda's office is empty and so is Emily's chair. Andy stares across the anteroom at it, then picks up a clipboard and some papers. Miranda comes in, unbuttoning her coat, which has a striped collar.",
    "125": "She leads him towards the door, and on the way, he picks up his hat. In the background, Dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and Neff move close to the door, and Phyllis opens it a crack. Both look at the stairs where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other, and the look is like a long kiss. Neff goes out, and with his briefcase under his arm, he comes down the steps to the street where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat and gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed but gets into the car. He puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat, closes the door, and starts the car. They drift down the hill, and Neff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance. Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb and turns around to look towards the car. Zachetti walks towards the car. Lola has opened the door and steps out of the car. She catches up with Zachetti, and they walk away together. Slowly, Neff puts the car in gear and drives on. His face is tight, and behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. There is a fair amount of activity, but the place is not crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot, passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display, and goes between the stalls into the market. He stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. As he is opening the pack, he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market. The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled, and she wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. She is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer passes and goes on out of the scene. Phyllis and Neff are now very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other. She hesitates, then opens her pocketbook. Neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket, and drops it into her bag.",
    "1251": "Andy puts down some items and is surprised to see Miranda sitting on the couch, wearing a dressing gown and no makeup, just staring into space with her glasses in her hand. Miranda has her hand held out, so Andy holds out a folder, which Miranda accepts ungraciously. Andy is taken aback and glances down at the papers in her lap, then looks at Miranda with sympathy. Miranda hands back the seating chart. Back in her own suite, Andy has changed into a slim-fitting low cut black suit and studies her reflection in a big mirror, touching up the mascara on her long, black lashes. Nigel comes in and studies the outfit she's wearing, then they raise their glasses. Andy and Christian have dinner in an elegant restaurant and afterwards, stroll near the Notre-Dame Cathedral where she swings around a lamppost and Christian kisses her. He kisses her again and again, and she kisses him back, wrapping her arm around his neck. They are surrounded by bare trees adorned with fairy lights and there's a view of the Eiffel Tower from Christian's hotel bedroom window. Andy wakes up in his bed alone, puts her hand to her head with a grimace, rolls over and consults her watch on the bedside table. She pulls on her clothes, hops around trying to put her shoes on, goes to grab her jacket and knocks over Christian's bag. Christian comes out of the bathroom in a towel and Andy grabs her stuff and goes. Walking along a modern bridge over the sand, she calls Miranda's suite and gets back to the hotel, pausing before knocking on Miranda's door. Miranda and Irv shut the door in her face. She changes into a black dress with a scoop neck, a full skirt with petticoats, and wears black gloves and a silver necklace. At the event, she paces the hallway. They had gathered in a plush banqueting suite with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Nigel steps down from the podium and Miranda makes her way over from the table she's been sitting at. Andy spies Christian sitting with Jacqueline. Miranda kisses Nigel before taking her place and James gets up and salutes his fans. Andy and Nigel smile over at him but Nigel's excited smile fades and he looks up at Miranda crestfallen. Pretty Jacqueline beams delightedly and Nigel puts on a brave face and applauds her. Jacqueline stands and Andy looks over at Miranda incredulously. Up on the podium, Miranda smiles and applauds Jacqueline as Irv eyes her coolly. Andy glances over at Christian, who looks stunned. James preens himself smugly and Nigel fidgets in his seat. Later, Andy gets into the back of a smart, black executive car, which is parked outside the venue.",
    "1252": "The car drives off down the chic Parisian street with Andy staring out of the window, a melancholy expression on her face, not looking at Miranda who sits beside her. A flashback shows Irv looking at the list. Andy turns and looks at Miranda, frowns, shakes her head, then turns back to look out of the window. The two women stare at one another before Miranda puts on a pair of large sunglasses, smiles at Andy, and steps out of the car where a swarm of photographers are waiting hungrily outside of the entrance of a grand building. Andy gets out of the car and watches Miranda as she makes her way through the throng. Andy ponders for a moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. Expecting Andy to be behind her, Miranda turns back to address her, looks around in confusion, then sees her young assistant striding off across the road. Looking slightly perturbed, Miranda carries on inside. Andy walks towards an ornate green and gold fountain and throws the phone into the fountain. With a smile on her face, Andy strolls off along the Place de la Concorde, the Eiffel Tower just visible in the distance. The Manhattan and Brooklyn suspension bridges stretch across the east river, which flows through the endless sprawl of buildings that make up New York City. A casually-dressed Andy is sitting in a coffee shop reading a newspaper. She looks up as Nate walks in and sits down in front of her. Andy stares down for a moment, then looks at Nate earnestly. Nate gazes into Andy's sad eyes, a smile flickering across his lips. He leans back in his seat and nods. Andy looks down wistfully, then smiles. Nate shrugs. She looks up at him. Nate beams at her. Andy smiles back, then looks down coyly. Andy gapes as she walks down a set of steps leading to the pavement, a smile spreading across her face. Dressed in smart jeans, a black polo neck, and a brown jacket, and still wearing a large grin, Andy walks down a busy street. She takes a mobile phone from her bag and begins to dial. Emily gapes in surprise, then composes herself. Emily hangs up, looking genuinely touched. She allows herself a brief smile, then looks over at Andy's replacement. Out on the street, Andy's smile fades as she sees Miranda leaving the building. Miranda finishes talking on her mobile as a silver Mercedes pulls up. As Miranda, who's wearing large Jackie O-style sunglasses, makes to get into the car, she suddenly spots Andy standing across the street. The two women regard each other for a moment, then Andy smiles and raises her hand in a wave.",
    "1253": "Rows of film studio buildings reflected in the shiny gold surface of a shield with the letters WB in its center. A series of 3D metallic Vs, one inside the other. Carl, a brown-haired guy in his 40s, rejects a call from an unknown caller. He stares down blankly, tenses, takes his phone out again, and hangs up once more. He takes his phone out and fumbles, accidentally answering it and sighing as he holds it to his ear. Carl turns to the window as Peter waves. Carl moves his mouth and then grumpily hangs up. At the Bigfoot Lodge, a ring sounds and they all turn to gawk as the guy nuzzles her. Carl eyes Rooney while Ted and Stephanie frown at him. He bashes into a waitress and slips, ending up on the floor with a tray of drinks. He stands and, stiff as a board, trudges off past a crowd of staring people. At home, Carl dons a suit jacket and studies his reflection in the mirror. He pops a name badge into his pocket and then smiles at himself. As he leaves his apartment, a small white-haired woman creeps up behind him and smiles. Outside a cafe, a guy bins a flyer. Carl sits at his computer and spots a colleague springing out of his chair as Norman hangs up. Carl swallows. Outside the bank, he rejects another call from an unknown caller, sits down on a wall, and takes out a leaflet. Carl frowns as Nick leans over him and lobs the rock. Nick is open-mouthed as two security guards run out of the building. One of them takes him down and the other one leaps on top. Nick leaps over a wall. Carl's in his car and rejects an unknown caller, winding up his window as a guy selling oranges approaches. He passes the man outside the cafe. At his desk, Carl browses DVDs in the video store and then sits alone on the sofa in his smart apartment watching a film. He frowns and pauses the film, going to the door to peep through the spyhole. Peter hurries off and Carl shuts his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney enter Carl's flat as Rooney goes to the fridge and Peter heads over towards the sofa. Peter furrows his brow and studies something, contorted but stiff. A fly lands on Carl's eye and he wakes from his nightmare, sitting up with a start on the couch, wide-eyed and disheveled. He stares into space miserably and swallows, frowning thoughtfully as he gazes down at something on the table and examines it. He makes his way towards the rows of seats and sits down. On two screens, Carl jumps out of his skin.",
    "1255": "She looks at Carl with a suspicious frown, then takes a photo and smiles. The woman halts cheekily as Carl smiles and then turns away, eying her scooter. They tear down a road on the scooter with Carl sitting behind the woman, Allison, wearing the helmet and clinging onto her. They weave in and out of the other traffic as she speeds up, overtaking two vehicles. Allison holds up her camera to take a picture and veers across the road onto the wrong side, causing oncoming cars to swerve. They head up a tree-lined hill and end up in the park by Carl's car. He pours petrol into his car and breaks into a smile, handing something back to her. He gazes at her feigning surprise as she, wearing the helmet, marches over to him, presses herself against him, and kisses him hard on the lips. She draws back, leaving him dumbfounded. He gazes at her as she gets back onto her scooter and drives off with a smile. His eyes follow her as she goes, then he turns back slowly, smiling to himself. He looks down, realizing he's holding the Polaroid of them on the scooter in his hand. He scrutinizes the photo, nods and smiles, his eyes darting around nervously. He puts the petrol cap back on, smiles, nods, and checks out the photo of him and Allison. Norman punches the air and smiles wistfully. Carl sits in front of his computer at the bank as three guys stare at him. He clicks to enlarge another pop-up as a corpulent woman heads over, gawks at him, and beams. Carl stamps the form with an approved stamp as a slice has been cut from the cake. He high-fives someone, forcing a grin. At the Bigfoot Lodge, Carl, Peter, and Rooney sit in a booth. Carl glances at Rooney as they slam down shot glasses. Carl spits out a lime and snorts Tabasco sauce off his hand, grimacing, before slamming his fists on the table and knocking over all the glasses. Carl plays on an arcade dance game, following the figure and arrows on the screen. He stands on a platform with arrows to the right, left, back, and front, moving his feet to the correct place to the beat. A crowd has gathered to watch him as he moves quickly, hopping about and spinning around, getting a perfect score. Peter and Rooney smile and cheer as he moves nimbly then twirls with his leg out, causing people to duck out of the way. Finally, he collapses backwards, and Peter and Rooney catch him. Carl snogs her as a big burly guy approaches and Rooney frowns. Outside, Carl is down and crashes into a bin.",
    "1256": "Peter and Rooney go to Carl's aid. They prop up the smiling Carl. Carl punches a random guy in the face. The burly guy knees him in the gut. The burly guy is restrained. Carl's face falls. He looks as if he's on the verge of tears. At home, Carl lies beside his toilet, his legs wrapped around the toilet bowl and his head near the door. He stirs. He opens his eyes. They flit from side to side. He smiles. Carl leaves his apartment and locks his door. He turns to find elderly, white-haired Tillie holding a hammer. She smiles and shrugs. Carl puts up shelves at Tillie's. Tillie knits while he drills. Tillie shakes her head. His shirt is trapped in the door. He tugs at his shirt. He yanks his shirt out and rolls backwards down a flight of steps. He sits up to see a scary dog charging towards him. The dog's chain stops it just short of Carl. Carl is frozen in terror, as the dog snaps its jaws inches from his face. A look of pained realization comes over him. Tillie pushes Carl back onto her bed. Tillie puts her false teeth into a glass. At work, Carl looks at an invitation on his computer. In his office Norman receives the response. Beaming, he gawks at the screen. Norman springs out of his chair excitedly. He gives Carl the thumbs up through the glass wall of his office. Carl salutes him. He salutes back. Carl pulls a silly face. Norman hides behind a wall then jumps out. Carl pretends to look away, then looks back at him sharply. Norman turns his glasses upside down and flaps around like a bird. Without his glasses on Norman crosses his eyes and holds his hands out. Carl winds sticky tape around his head. Carl tapes his nose up so it looks like a pig's snout. Carl's face looks deformed and lumpy. He sticks out his teeth. Norman looks uncomfortable and retreats. He takes out cash. A bed is delivered. Carl jumps on his new bed. He's balanced a glass of wine on the corner. It doesn't fall over. In a guy's room, Carl learns to play guitar. Carl takes off in a light aircraft. An instructor is beside him. Carl sits at a desk in a Korean class. His classmates laugh. The teacher gives him a withering look. He ladles soup for homeless people. The vagrant's on his phone. Carl snatches a flier from the guy outside the cafe. He pauses and checks his flier. Inside, Carl walks up to the bar and sits. It's the guy from outside the cafe. The guy walks up to the barman.",
    "1257": "On stage, a band performs wearing seahorses on their heads. Carl turns to look, then shakes his head incredulously as Allison walks onstage wearing a spangly mini top hat and plays a keyboard. Carl stands with his hand on his heart, grins, and gazes at her. She pouts at the crowd, then furrows her brow. Later, Carl sits at the bar with a bottle of beer. Smiling, Allison sashays up beside him. Carl sits smiling and waiting, and she glances over and beams while he looks down. They walk in the middle of a dark street and reach her scooter. Wrinkling her nose, she smiles, and they both smile. Carl then throws himself into bed, sets an alarm clock, puts it on his bedside table, and switches off his lamp. He scowls at his phone, then answers it, and switches the lamp on again. Early morning joggers stretch in front of a large observatory with three domes as a car races up the hill and comes to a halt. Carl climbs out, with cans of energy drinks tumbling out when he opens the door. He removes a can stuck to his shoe, runs over, punches the air, and bounds off. He sprints down a hill with the others jogging behind, taking snaps on their cameras. Carl leaps onto a bench by a couple hugging, snaps them with his phone, then darts off again. The group jogs along a pathway on a hillside and find Carl collapsed on the ground, his eyes closed. Allison squats and starts snapping Carl, and everyone else does the same thing. Allison and Carl stand together at the top of the hill. Carl downs a bottle of water, then gasps in air, pretends to write notes, and nods thoughtfully. She slaps him across the arm. Carl and Peter eat in the garden of a restaurant. Carl downs a glass of water. A Persian woman is present. Carl picks up a basket that Peter's food was in. Peter stands to kiss Lucy. They sit, and Faranoush beams at her. Lucy stares, flabbergasted. Norman opens his front door. They're dressed as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The others stare as guests play a game of mock Quidditch. Carl smiles. The first Harry Potter film is on, and Norman gazes at the screen and waves. Carl and Allison stand up to leave, and Carl freezes. The party guests clap, and Norman lets them out. Carl and Allison zoom down a dark street on Allison's scooter. Carl sits behind her with his arms around her waist. The scooter wobbles unsteadily with Carl driving. He smiles nervously, eyes something on the other side of the street, and grins. Carl and Allison hurry towards a chain-link fence with a gate which is locked.",
    "1260": "Two safety guys stand by as Carl dives off, free-falling hundreds of feet towards a river before getting whipped back up by the heavy-duty elastic. Waving his arms, Carl swings back and forth beneath the giant, curved bridge supports and takes out his phone. Wes, on a golf course, hands his phone to a caddy. At Norm's, Norm is having a Sparta-themed party, wearing a red cape and holding a shield and spear. Later, he sits weeping with Carl beside him, looking anxious with his hand on Norm's shoulder. Norm is wearing a false beard and mustache, which Carl notices slipping and sticks back in place before looking down humbly. At home, Carl checks his answer phone. At the Bigfoot Lodge, the sign shows an ominous figure in a forest as Carl stands outside the entrance looking pensive. Peter and Lucy walk up, and Carl leads them inside where Carl and Peter dance. Janet offers a piece of cake to Lee as Faranoush looks again. Norm leans against the bar, looking morose. Carl taps him on his left shoulder and leans round to his right, causing Norm to bow. With his hand on Soo-Mi's shoulder, Norm dances around as they walk off. Lucy, with a group of friends, catches Carl's eye, smiles, and waves. She points around the room and gives Carl a big thumbs-up before they share a fond smile. Sitting alone at a table, Carl makes a phone call. Allison is at an exhibition of her photos, opening then closing her phone as a woman looks at the photo of Carl sprawled on the ground. Allison smiles tightly, and the woman raises her eyebrows. Peter sits next to Carl and smiles. Rooney stands at the bar alone as Tillie walks up and smiles at him broadly. He looks at her warily, has a drink, knocks back a shot, and ushers her out of the bar, looking back cautiously as he goes. Carl arrives home and she kisses him. He responds and kisses her for a moment, then pulls away sharply, looking pained. Carl gets into an elevator and presses a button. The doors close and as the elevator descends, the light flickers. Carl looks up as the elevator stalls and the doors open, stuck below the level of the floor. Carl clambers out and walks off along the hall, looking around cautiously. As Carl walks across the forecourt, a black cat runs past behind him. He stumbles onto a car bonnet and sees a guy hooking his car up to a tow truck. The guy is Carl. He runs from his hallucination. Terrence drives away from a hotel as Carl pops up in the back of the car, and Terrence hits the gas.",
    "1264": "Harry stemmed the flow of blood from Snape's neck with one hand and held the phial to Snape's cheek, catching his tears in it. He then removed the phial from Snape's cheek and gripped it. Snape studied Harry's face as Harry's lips trembled. Snape's eyes glazed over, and his head lolled to one side. Hermione glanced briefly at Ron, then looked down at the floor. Harry stared at the dead Snape. The surface of the water started to ripple, and the building trembled. Harry steadied himself against the glass wall, while Ron held onto the door, and Hermione clasped her hands to her ears. Fred Weasley was injured. Distressed, Hermione and Ron stood a little way behind Harry. It was still dark, and pockets of fire burned throughout the school and grounds as the three friends made their way back up the path to the courtyard. Ron pushed open the doors of the Great Hall, and the three were confronted by piles of rubble. Further in, they saw students and staff, and two students carrying someone out on a stretcher. Ron spotted something and hurried forward, with Hermione following. Harry stood frozen in the doorway. Slughorn was tending to the wounded Filch and turned. Harry passed a long line of people being treated and saw Professor Trelawney and Padma Patil pull a blanket up over a dead body. He saw the Weasleys up ahead, with George weeping and clinging to his father, hugging Ron desperately. Fleur comforted Bill, and distraught Molly kneeled beside Fred's body, stroking his hair. Ron joined her, sobbing helplessly, while Hermione stood at a distance. Harry watched the grieving family and glanced to his left, seeing the bodies of Nymphadora and Remus lying side by side on stretchers, with Remus' little finger resting on hers. Professor McGonagall limped towards Harry, but without seeing her, Harry turned and strode out of the Great Hall. He entered Dumbledore's old office, which was undamaged. As he stepped further in, covered doors to his right opened of their own accord, and a stone pedestal slid out. Harry crossed to the pedestal, lifted out a shallow silver basin, and gently spun it through the air. It floated towards the desk at the far side of the room. He followed the spinning basin, the Pensieve, to the desk, where it landed lightly. Holding the phial containing Snape's tears, Harry removed the stopper and emptied the contents into the basin. He saw misty black swirls appear in the Pensieve and sank his face into the bowl. The swirling black cleared to reveal a meadow, where two young girls stood facing each other. It was his mother, Lily, and her sister, Petunia. Lily opened her palm to reveal a daisy growing in it. An equally young Severus Snape emerged from a large tree trunk, and Petunia ran off.",
    "1265": "Snape bends down and picks a plant with two leaves, which flutter like wings. He guides it to Lily. The red-haired Lily smiles at the boy Severus. He glances at her. Then, they both look up at the Willow tree above them. The wind rustles the branches and the leaves fall flying like tiny birds. The fluttering leaves skim over the water. The image changes. Lily wears the Sorting Hat. She glances at Severus as she walks down the hall. At the dining table, another boy sits beside her. Pale-faced Severus looks at her, doe-eyed. James smiles at Lily, who gazes back at him. Lily and James, kiss and dance. Voldemort kills Lily. An image of Wormtail. Snape's face softens. Dumbledore's blackened hand. Draco and the vanishing cabinet. The night of Dumbledore's death, which Harry witnessed on the Astronomy tower. Images of Voldemort, and Harry, restless in his sleep. The night of Lily's death. Snape enters the bedroom in the house in Godric's Hollow and finds her dead, beside Harry's cot. Snape is overcome with grief. He gazes at her lying lifeless on the floor. There are tears in baby Harry's eyes. A raw, jagged scar in his forehead. Teenage Harry peers through a doorway. Snape raises his wand, and completes two circles, in the air. Creating white wisps of cloud. They gather to form a Patronus in the shape of a beautiful silver doe. It leaps out through a window. Longingly, Snape watches it leave. Dumbledore spins around, mouth agape. Snape rocks Lily's lifeless body in his arms. Snape's face is somber. In the forest, Harry sees the doe approach. The black swirls and the Pensieve return. Harry lifts his head out of the bowl. His eyes are wide and anxious. Dazed, he slowly backs away, holding his hand to his heart. Harry sits down on a step. His face is unshaven and dirty. He stares ahead blankly. He sits motionless. Harry walks downstairs along pathways cleared amongst the rubble. He turns on a landing, and sees Hermione and Ron sitting together on a step, further down. He pauses, stares at them, and descends. They start to follow him. Hermione holds Ron's arm. Hermione fights back tears. She rushes forward and flings her arms around his neck. Over her shoulders, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry. They separate. Harry takes his leave and Ron moves over to Hermione. Side by side, they watch as Harry slowly makes his way down the stone staircase. Outside, Harry walks slowly across the deserted courtyard. The remnants of flickering fires cast his shadow before him. Harry enter The Forbidden Forest. Treading carefully, he stops by a tree.",
    "1266": "Harry turns and checks behind him, then turns back and lifts up the golden snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore. The writing on it appears, and Harry studies it. He lifts the golden snitch to his mouth and presses it to his lips. The outer casing opens, and the inner casing revolves to create an opening, revealing a polished octagonal stone inside. On one surface, a circle is inscribed inside a triangle down the middle of which is a line. The stone floats out of the snitch, and Harry places the palm of his right hand under it. He carefully clenches his fist around it and closes his eyes. Harry slowly opens them and stares ahead. In front of him stand his parents, with Sirius and Remus. Lily stretches out her hand, but Harry's hand passes right through hers when he tries to take it. They gaze at each other, and Lily lowers her hand and smiles. Harry turns to Sirius and takes a few paces forward, then nods at his father, James. He turns and gazes at his mother, then moves towards her. He looks across at his father, and Sirius points at Harry's heart. Once again, Harry's gaze lights upon his mother. He unclenches his fist, and the Resurrection Stone falls gently onto the forest floor. Voldemort stands in a clearing in the forest and opens his eyes, glaring at the gaunt-faced Death Eater. Bellatrix Lestrange walks up behind Voldemort, who takes a few paces forward and turns around. Bellatrix lowers her head reverentially as he passes her, the Elder Wand clasped in his right hand. He stops and half turns his head. Bellatrix peers through the gloom and sees Harry coming into the clearing. Voldemort flexes his neck and looks back over his shoulder, then turns to face Harry. Hagrid sees him, and Voldemort stares at the teenager who stands unwavering in front of him. Nagini slithers past Hagrid towards Voldemort, who steadies himself and raises his wand. Harry stands unflinching and closes his eyes. A stream of green light flashes from the Elder Wand and hits Harry full on. Bright white light. Harry comes to, clean shaven, unbruised, and without his spectacles. He stands silhouetted against a completely white background. Behind him in the whiteness, there's a small bench. He walks over to it and bends down to peer underneath the bench, recoiling when he sees a tiny, skeletal, red, raw naked figure curled up in a fetal position. Dumbledore steps towards him, wearing a silvery white robe in the vista of white. Harry looks around and glances back at the fetal figure. They stroll along the platform and sit down on a bench. Dumbledore gets to his feet.",
    "1270": "Harry and Ron are standing by Dobby's grave when Bellatrix approaches them. Hermione, transformed to look exactly like Bellatrix, joins them after Griphook reluctantly slides the sword into her bottomless bag. Ron, disguised as a long-haired, bearded Death Eater, holds out his hand, palm upwards, and Hermione and Harry grasp it. Harry turns to Griphook, who places his hand on the others, and they apparate in a dark and gloomy street by Gringott's Bank. A cloaked man spots Hermione, who walks ahead of the others, then moves away. Harry bends down and Griphook climbs on his back, then Ron flings the invisibility cloak over them. Standing in the imposing banking hall, Hermione glances anxiously back at Ron, then stares wide-eyed at the rows of goblin tellers ahead of them. She teeters in her unaccustomed heeled shoes but tries to look austere as she swaggers along when a goblin teller looks up. Wearing a long, black coat, Ron walks behind her, his head bowed, while Harry and Griphook, hidden under the invisibility cloak, follow. Harry spots an armed guard. Like Bellatrix, Hermione has a stand of long, black hair over her right eye and stops in front of a wizened old goblin behind a high desk. The goblin continues to write in his ledger as Hermione, arms folded, regards him haughtily. He looks down at her, then turns and leaves his desk. A teller looks up, and Griphook whispers to Ron, who sees an armed guard slowly pacing towards them. The old teller returns to his desk with Bogrod, a bespectacled goblin. Under the cloak, Harry and Griphook have moved nearer the desk and stand beside Bogrod. Harry casts a spell, and Bogrod's demeanor changes, smiling benignly. Griphook is driving a cart along a twisting rail track, hurtling through dark, underground tunnels with Harry and Ron sitting on his right and Hermione on his left. Bogrod, in his happy, mesmerized state, sits behind his fellow goblin, facing back of the track. Traveling at incredible speed, the cart's single headlight illuminates a waterfall gushing beneath the track. Griphook brakes desperately as the track twists down towards the waterfall. They pass through the cascade, and the rail-cart comes to a halt. An alarm is activated, and they're tipped out of the cart and plummet, then stop falling and land safely. All five get to their feet and look up at the cart as it trundles away. Harry turns to Ron and Hermione, and Ron recasts the spell on Bogrod, who smiles benignly. Ron leads them in semi-darkness towards a cavern where a huge, gray, spiky dragon lies chained on the ground. Griphook takes something from an opened wooden crate and hands it to Ron.",
    "1271": "The dragon rises and breathes fire, then cowers as Griphook shakes a bell. Ron shakes the bell given to him by the goblin, and they ease past the dragon. They continue along a narrow passageway and reach a door. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand into the locking mechanism, and Bogrod grins inanely as the door opens. The dragon belches flame as they enter the vault and close the door. Light appears at the tip of their three wands, revealing the vault filled with treasure: gold and silver goblets, candlesticks, jewels, and stacks of coins. Harry walks further into the vault, moving ahead of the others. He stops, turns his head, blinks, then stares up at something. It's a gold cup with two handles. Hermione dislodges a ring, which replicates, causing other objects to start replicating as well. She throws it to Harry, who catches it and wades through the growing mass of treasure. Up to his knees, Harry scrambles over the treasure towards the cup. The treasure is now waist height. Harry stretches the sword high above his head, reaching for the cup, but he disappears from sight, lost in a mountain of gold and silver treasure. The others remain stock-still. Harry stumbles and drops the cup. Griphook grabs it, and Harry tosses him the sword. He flings the cup to Hermione. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand against the door, and replicating treasure tumbles out through the open doorway. The three are buried inside the vault. Griphook rings the bells to keep the dragon at bay. Harry struggles out of the vault and runs to a balustrade. Griphook runs off, leaving the grinning Bogrod alone with the dragon. The dragon raises its head and breathes fire, incinerating Bogrod. Armed guards rush in, throwing explosive bursts from their wands. She destroys the balustrade and, taking a run-up, leaps through the opening onto the dragon's back. Clinging to its spikes, she hauls herself up. The beast belches flame, and goblins take cover. Ron and Harry are still by the vault. They leap onto the dragon's back. Her spell releases the dragon's chains. It breathes fire and looks up towards a pinprick of light high above. The three friends cling on desperately as the dragon climbs towards the light. A guard shoots from an approaching rail cart. The dragon knocks the track with its head, and the cart and its passengers plummet. All is quiet in the banking hall. Rows of tellers pore over ledgers. Above their heads, a chandelier starts to sway. A teller looks up. The dragon bursts through a grating in the floor. Guards and goblins flee the flames. The dragon's head hits the chandelier. The three cling on as the dragon bursts its way through a glass dome onto the roof.",
    "1272": "The three friends, Hermione on one side and Ron and Harry on the other, hang onto the dragon's horny spikes as it takes flight, clumsily buffeting against rooftops and chimneypots before soaring into the air with the Thames winding far below. The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon flies off, heading west along the river, its outstretched wings barely moving as the currents of air carry it along. They soar through clouds and fly low over the river. As they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort attacking a bank guard, a finger recoiling from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, the Horcrux locket, and Voldemort spinning. Harry surfaces, seeing more images, including Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor and Voldemort roaring. He sees Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, the two-handled gold cup, and Voldemort frowning, eyes staring, turning uneasily. Harry surfaces again and swims towards the shore. All three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop and put on dry clothes. Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank, speaking to his snake with the Malfoys standing nearby, eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake. Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. It is night in snowy Hogsmeade as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby and run off, Death Eaters scouring the village. Two Death Eaters search a covered market, looking under stalls and lifting covers, the three fugitives crouching down out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market as the trio run up a set of narrow steps, reaching a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters, the others following him down a staircase into a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp. Ron looks puzzled as Hermione and he see a painting on a wall, a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her, the bottom corner of the mirror having a piece missing. She looks surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, showing the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in, setting down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth, who stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting, past trees and bushes. Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting.",
    "1277": "Hermione smiles. Ron races after the three students as Harry starts to climb a mountain of furniture to reach the diadem. Hermione follows him. Harry finds a blue Pixie in the junk and tosses it aside. More Pixies fly out of the mountain of furniture. Harry climbs frantically. Hermione is beside him. He sees the diadem wedged in the sofa and wrenches it out. They clamber back down to the floor. They look down one of the aisles. The entrance to the aisle is glowing. A huge wave of flames surges towards them. It unites with a second wave and pursues Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry knocks over furniture to slow it down. Harry looks back. The furniture is consumed by the raging inferno. The flames take the form of a fiery winged dragon. Goyle tries to extinguish the flames from the tip of his burning wand. Draco and Blaise back away from the fiery dragon. Goyle tosses his burning wand into the fire. Hermione and Ron sprint ahead of the flames. In a different aisle, Harry is pursued by a flaming serpent. Terrified, Draco and his cronies begin scrambling up a high stack of furniture. Reunited, Harry, Hermione, and Ron see flames ahead of them. They turn. They are surrounded. Harry magics a protective shield. Ron falls back against some broomsticks and throws them to his friends. They sow upwards. Goyle climbs after Draco and Blaise. Dislodging a chair, Goyle falls backwards into the raging inferno below. Draco and Blaise watch him fall. Ron turns to Harry. Losing their grip, Draco and Blaise fall. They cling to a carpet by their fingertips. Harry looks round. They swing their brooms round. Harry flies past, just missing Draco's outstretched hand. They try another pass. Harry grabs Draco and hauls him onto the broomstick. Ron grabs Blaise. Hermione leads the way as they swerve to avoid tumbling, burning furniture. Hermione aims her wand at the flames up ahead. She clears a path. They make it out through the doors and fall off the broomsticks. Draco runs for it. Harry sees the diadem lying on the ground. Hermione tosses him a Basilisk's Fang. He sinks it into the diadem. Black smoke rises from it. Ron kicks the diadem back into the burning room. Three fiery images of Voldemort appear, surging towards them. As they back away, the doors slam shut. Gasping, Harry leans against a pillar. Nagini twists into a coil. Voldemort falters. Harry shivers in the light. Voldemort turns in the dark, his face sweaty and taut. Harry grimaces. Voldemort faces his army. A group of Death Eaters steps forward, led by Pius Thicknesse. The spell kills Thicknesse.",
    "1278": "Stars drift slowly in the blackness of space. A moon glows silver in the darkness, seen from the mountainous surface of the Earth. Letters form around the moon, a circle of reflected sunlight and the Earth form the two Os. In 1928, a blizzard lashes the Karakoram mountains in India. In a tent, a candle glows in a lantern and a cup of snow is placed on a gas burner. Climbing spikes are sharpened. Wind tears at the canvas walls of the tent. A light shines outside, then goes dark. A bearded climber looks puzzled. He emerges from the tent in thick furs with a climbing ax and a rope wrapped around him. He pulls on goggles to protect his eyes. Beams of light radiate skywards from behind a rocky ridge. The climber carefully ascends a snowy slope. He inches up a near vertical cliff, plunges his ice ax into the rock, and hauls himself up over the edge of the rock face. He stands slowly upright and moves forward as the wind howls around him. He moves on, steadying himself with the ice ax. The climber raises his goggles and stares at a glowing ball embedded in the snowy rock. Lights pulse inside the orb as he approaches. He closes on the object, which is about 10 feet high. Its surface is crystalline, with shadows and lights swirling inside. He reaches out a hand on the orb. He slowly runs his hand over the surface, eyes narrowed above his snow crusted dark beard. He raises the ice axe. Light shines out as he breaks the crystalline crust. He squints at the intensity, the swirling brilliance within. He's enveloped in a brilliant light of overwhelming intensity. The ice axe lies on the snow. The climber lies next to it, his eyes closed. He awakens and rises slowly. He sits up and looks around. There is a spherical hole in the snowy rock face, but the orb is gone. The climber looks at his right hand. The mitten has a hole in it. He removes it, revealing a round coin-sized scar on the back of his hand. He frowns and checks his palm, too. He sits on the snow-covered rocky ground and looks skywards through the swirling snow. Objects seen through an electron microscope appear on a screen. The tutor is slim, with dark hair tied in a ponytail. She smiles hesitantly. Cars stream across an arched iron bridge over a river. The tutor drives a small silver hatchback. A computer game character has a sword across his back. Jacob has long dark curly hair. The tutor, his guardian, is white. Jacob is black. She crosses to the bed where he's concentrating on the game and sits beside him.",
    "128": "The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, keeping his head down. Meanwhile, Phyllis is holding the attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the ticket. Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the ticket. They are now close together. She kisses him. The redcap comes from inside the car and descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly. She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car. Neff and the Porter are together. The conductor is going on into the car. Neff is half turned away from the porter. He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through. Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously. Neff hobbles on through. Four or five passengers are reading or writing. It's dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car. Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing. He stands looking back along the rails. Neff stands silent. He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something. Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers. He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train recedes slowly into the night. Neff picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out. He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot.",
    "1281": "Helen spots a razor and a shaving brush. He looks at her defiantly. She sighs and, carrying a washing basket, runs downstairs. Red and blue lights flash outside as she crosses to the front door. A blonde woman in a blue top is standing among the group of police officers. Helen looks shocked. Motorcycle outriders prepare to escort the waiting car. A stern-faced woman with dark hair sits in the front seat. The blonde woman puts her arms protectively around the bemused Jacob. The convoy of two cars and four motorcycles pulls away. Lights flashing, they speed down rain-soaked streets. He points to the road ahead. Beyond the outriders, their side of the highway is empty. She stares at the expressionless agent who stares straight ahead ignoring her. More vehicles join the convoy rolling down the empty night-time highway. Military vehicles and personnel maneuver as gates open to admit them. A Chinook helicopter stands outside a large hangar. The convoy pulls up at an aircraft. It's loaded rack down. The agent ushers the stunned Helen towards the helicopter. Inside, it's packed with soldiers and some civilians. Helen finds a space and sits down nervously. She looks across at a man with a dark, bushy beard. The twin rotor helicopter lifts off into the dark night sky. Floodlights illuminate a sports field teeming with equipment and personnel. The chopper lands mid-field. A soldier carries a heavy machine gun on his shoulder. As police cars escort more vehicles through the military throne. Soldiers push racks of protective clothing along a walkway. A NASA space agency logo adorns the screen in a large lecture theater. It's on a collision course with the Earth. Graphics show impact location Manhattan. Helen stares. The screen shows one hour 18 minutes 43 seconds. The time is counting down. She tentatively opens the toilet cubicle door. She looks nervously at the woman in military uniform and nods. Choppers hurtle towards the bright lights of Manhattan. Helen looks shocked and stares out of the window of the chopper at the city lights. Helen and Yusef hold hands as the scientists brace themselves. Helen opens her eyes. A bright ball of light is moving through the dark sky above the illuminated city. It passes behind the towering Empire State building. It illuminates the gothic façade of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and moves with swirling brilliance towards Central Park. Trees cast eerie shadows across the grass. As people gather and stare up in horror. As Helen stares out of the chopper window as the object sinks towards the ground. Powerful blasts of energy slow descent, generating clouds of billowing vapor. The watching crowds are silhouetting in its intense light. The draft from the object's descent causes a tsunami of wind and vapor.",
    "1285": "Klaatu walks up to a snack machine and, watched by a child, studies the mechanism before placing his hand on the selection panel. A tuna salad sandwich drops into the collection tray. A little curly-haired lad walks up and stares at Klaatu, who senses the presence, turns and stares back. He stands as the boy continues to stare before being ushered away by his mother. A heavy-set man notices and follows Klaatu. Klaatu watches a ticket fight and takes a bite of the sandwich. The big man collapses and the thief sees his chance, snatching the ticket back off the prone man. A security guard chases the thief as his colleague attends the fallen man. Klaatu watches and then walks into the grubby men's room. Standing in front of the mirror, he pulls back his jacket to reveal a patch of blood on his chest seeping through his shirt. He touches the blood, studies his reflection, then touches a finger to the sweat on his brow before collapsing. Meanwhile, with a reprimanding look, Helen takes the phone as the family next door unloads their car. Crowds mob the offices of the New Jersey Transport Police and Helen pushes her way through the throng. She moves through the crowd and is concerned to see Klaatu sitting on a bench, his head slumped forward. As she approaches, he looks up into her eyes. Evacuees file through the city past fences topped with barbed wire. In the pouring rain, Helen opens the passenger door of her car and Klaatu gets in. Jacob is sitting in the back and Klaatu turns to look at the boy. Helen shoots Klaatu a mistrustful look and maneuvers her silver car out into the busy street. She pulls out a sample of his fatty birth skin, dips his finger in, and rubs some of the substance on the stitched bullet wound on his chest. The wound heals immediately and Helen stares in disbelief, gaping at him open-mouthed. Jacob looks puzzled while Klaatu calmly adjusts his tie. Lost for words, Helen obeys Klaatu's instructions. Two heavily-armed fighter drones hurtle through the clouds towards Manhattan, remote-piloted from the base. They skim between the high-rise city blocks and the pilot's eye view is displayed on a bank of monitors. The orange light glows in the huge robot's head as the Reapers approach. Beams of energy shoot out from the robot's eye slit, detonating the missiles. Beams from the robot are locked on the Reapers, sending them plunging into two tanks. The robot's light goes out and the Colonel rips off his headset in frustration. Traffic clogs the nighttime highway and, as Helen pulls into a rain-drenched parking lot, an illuminated golden arches sign is reflected in the car's windscreen.",
    "1287": "A sphere rises over the Great Wall of China, another over the Pyramids. From all over the world, glowing spheres head into space, away from earth's atmosphere. Klaatu walks in slow-motion through the woods, a shadow emerging through the mist. Glaring at him, Jacob reluctantly obeys. They are caught in the police car's spotlight as she backs away from him in horror. Klaatu's face appears on the cop's computer. The officer drives up to them. The cop looks shocked. With a touch, he sends Helen's car crashing into the cop, crushing him against his own cruiser. Klaatu then releases Helen's car. The cop slumps dead to the ground. Klaatu scoops some of the fatty flesh from the sample jar. He touches a hand to the police cruiser, activating all its systems. Helen and Jacob stare as he then reaches down with his other hand and touches the alien flesh to the officer's head. Power surges through the man's body. The officer rolls over. He's alive. They stare at one another. Klaatu looks around, hearing the sirens. Mike's with the Defense Secretary. The robot is floating down a deep, concrete-walled shaft. The light in its head slit comes on. Helen's car is parked in the rain. A grandfather clock shows 5 past 11. Helen leads the way into the house. She leads the way into a study. Klaatu walks into the next room which has books piled everywhere, and approaches a chalkboard covered in figures. He erases a highly complex formula. Helen turns away looking worried and approaches Jacob. She strokes the boy's hair affectionately. Klaatu writes his own formula on the chalkboard. A gray-haired man watches as he works, then approaches him. He picks up a piece of chalk and also starts to write. Klaatu glances at Karl's work then moves to another part of the board. Karl pauses to look at his figures as Helen watches them both curiously. Klaatu draws a sweeping arrow across the board, connecting the formulae. Karl continues to write as Klaatu adjusts some of his equations. Klaatu studies him, then turns away from the chalkboard. Walks across the room, and looks up at the speaker which the music is playing through. Lights shine in the dark at Mount Weather Flash Facility, Bluemont, Virginia. The suited agent steps into the operations room separated from a circular chamber by thick windows. The windows look out onto the vast head and shoulders of GORT. The light in his head is glowing orange and tracks the agent's every move. The agent stares at GORT and walks slowly forwards. GORT's glowing eye follows him. The agent backs nervously away from the window. Klaatu studies him thoughtfully. He walks out of the room through the French windows out onto a terrace.",
    "1289": "Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow, sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. A dog barks, jarring Juno back to reality. A teacup poodle is tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again. She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Juno arrives at Dancing Elk Drug on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk. She enters the drugstore. Rollo, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest and regards her with intense skepticism. An eavesdropping tough girl wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach but then sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down one of the aisles. She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the results. Shake. Shake. Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope. She trudges toward her house. The yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wildflowers. She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose. Juno's bedroom is decorated with punk posters: The Damned, The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend. Leah's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard. Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well-manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team. Bleeker discreetly pushes a postcard to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. Bleeker puts on double socks in his Car-Bed. He puts on his sweatbands. Bleeker applies Runner's Glide. A croissant pocket warms in the microwave. Paul Bleeker steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice. Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously. She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off. Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it. Steve looks back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings. Leah is at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, Keith.",
    "1294": "Vanessa sits alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine and letting the day's events sink in. After a moment, Mark comes down the stairs to join her and nods before sitting down. Suddenly, there's a loud knock on the front door. Mark opens it and squints to see Juno pulling away in the van. He holds up a note, and we can see there's writing on the back. Vanessa takes the note from his hand and examines it. Meanwhile, a porch light has been left on for Juno, and her place looks cozy and inviting. She parks her car and walks up to her house, picking a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffing it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it. Inside, Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes. Juno enters, and a wave of realization crosses her face. She presses Bleeker's hand against her belly and lets out a genuine shriek of pain. The doctor reveals Juno's baby boy above the sheet, and Juno looks at the baby in awe before her eyes begin to flutter and she passes out. Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track, with a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer as Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. Bleeker looks out at the bleachers, scanning them for Juno, then takes off running toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. A nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator, reaching into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifting up a swaddled newborn baby. The note looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom, where she is lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered, and incredibly happy. There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed, indicating she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment. It's a sparkling summer afternoon when Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage, obviously not pregnant anymore. Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two Weimaraners. Juno looks happy but older, almost as happy with her dogs as Vanessa looked with her baby.",
    "1296": "Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently. As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. They then see the dog is laying on its side and has a barbecue fork in its neck. Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth. He inhales the asthma spray. He lowers the inhaler so he can speak. Graham stares at his ten-year-old son. He starts crying. Graham picks him up in his arms. Graham reaches up for Bo. She has dirt and tears on her face. She slowly climbs down. Graham carries Bo as she cries in his arms. He starts towards the house. Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food. Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands. Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. Officer Paski is pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. Graham lies in bed. He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. Graham slowly gets up from the bed. He takes his daughter's hand and starts out of the room. They both sit quietly for a moment. He looks to his daughter with startled eyes. Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window. A large silhouetted figure is outside. Graham stands. Merrill opens the front door. It's pitch black outside. Merrill turns to Graham and gestures with his fingers. Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a gesture. Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house. Merrill waves his arms. Merrill turns a corner full speed. The large figure has come. Merrill's eyes drift above them. Graham starts out of the kitchen. Bo watches cartoons. Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. Graham and Edgar walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car. Graham turns it off. Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. Downtown Bucks County. A group of small stores along a quiet street. The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around. Merrill puts change in the meter. Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo. Morgan holds out his hand. Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk.",
    "1297": "Graham watches Merrill and others turn into a store, then sees Merrill step onto the sidewalk and walk away with his hands in his pockets. Graham turns and calls after him, and Merrill waves over his shoulder but keeps walking. Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy, which is three aisles wide. Mr. and Mrs. Nathan, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter and watch a black and white TV. Morgan steps up to the counter, shrugs, and Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside, pointing over to the far corner. A gum-chewing pharmacist in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio. Graham stares at the girl, noticing her teary eyes and shaky voice. Meanwhile, Merrill is in a narrow army recruiting center, looking at a poster of a muscular guy in an army uniform. A crewcut guy savors the silence, then smiles at Merrill and hands him a brochure. Merrill looks at the brochure and then at Lionel, a young man about his age sitting at a folding table, who smirks. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket and turns to start walking, making a quick move towards Lionel as if he might hit him, causing Lionel to flinch. Merrill walks out the door as Graham glances at the girl in the pharmacy, his eyes widening. Morgan turns a knob on the side and hands Graham the monitor. Everyone becomes frozen standing next to the station wagon with three open doors. Graham looks at Merrill over the roof and hands the monitor over the hood to him. Merrill reaches for it, and Graham looks at Merrill, who is now one of them. Morgan is the first one to move, climbing onto the station wagon's roof to take the monitor from Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.",
    "1298": "Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood. Merrill climbs over the side and joins Morgan on the roof, keeping a hand on his nephew. Morgan raises the monitor above his head. There's movement right next to him. Graham spins and aims the flashlight at the crops to his right. The light only penetrates a few feet into the crops. Graham holds his breath, then turns and drops the flashlight at the same time. The beam of light turns off when the flashlight hits the ground. Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness, his hands searching over the ground in all directions. They finally touch the flashlight. Graham tries to get up but stumbles backwards into the crops. He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise, then gets up and starts running. Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions. There is something coming behind. Graham makes a sudden right turn, putting his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes. He makes another sudden turn, this time left, and keeps running across the yard. Graham steps into the kitchen, his hair messed and his shirt having a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it. The children don't notice his presence, splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat, his kind eyes staring down at the ground as he slows his mind, his breathing a slow controlled pant. The children stop playing and look up to Graham, following his stare to the kitchen table. Graham looks up at them. Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand and grabs one. Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR. Morgan stares at his sister. Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa, both having the same dazed, slow movements. Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically, finds one, and reaches for the VCR. He's breathing heavy now, wheezing actually. Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his father and his uncle. Bo walks over and squeezes in also. The four of them stare at the television. Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales. The family room lights are off now. There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on the television now. Bo is asleep on Graham's shoulder. Morgan is asleep on Merrill's lap. Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill. Merrill looks his brother in the eyes, then looks at the TV screen.",
    "1309": "He sits as thoughts crash at his head, then finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car. Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot. Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine. The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. Elijah starts breathing harder and pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot. He gains on the army jacket. The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot and disappears into the subway entrance. Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway and looks into the entrance. A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing and starts his descent. Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility, and then his foot catches on a step. His hand slips away from the railing. He falls down the remaining part of the stairs and comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a grimace. His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he moves through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out from the belt of his pants. David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes and turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Joseph runs out from the huddle across the field to David and nods. David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who stands with the other children. David stares at his son and watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep.",
    "1313": "Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth. He watches him for a beat. David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself. Then David steps back to look around. He bumps the shoulder of a man standing behind him. David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable. David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man. He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive. He's wearing a one piece orange uniform. The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his bin inside. David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. And then they open. The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit. David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it. The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it. The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening. It opens slowly anyway.",
    "1318": "Willie follows and enters, then goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Kid yanks away. As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say. Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks. It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him. Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes. Willie wears a forbearing smile. He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty red Santa sack. Marcus stares. Jesse, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining. As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. Willie drops the bag with a loud thud. Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. He gets up and walks away. Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless. Bob Chipeska sits opposite. A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall. Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid. Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team. Willie sees off another child. Willie stares at him. Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced. Marcus sighs. Gin leaves. Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space. The Kid turns to go. Willie beckons him. He displays an envelope. The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue. He reaches self-consciously up to it. Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait. Marcus stares at him. Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs. Lois is in the driver's seat. Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals.",
    "1323": "Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes. Charlie tried hard to push and a baby's cries are heard. Audrey stood stunned, wide-eyed, and holding up the child. Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out of the static, the haunting sounds of Bing Crosby singing Silent Night fills the room. The quiet before the storm. Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up. She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes. Those words provide her little comfort. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael. The baby cries louder. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie. Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Michael cocks his gun, points it at Sandra. Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes. Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core. A brilliant spectral light pours into the diner. She raises a hand to block the light. And that's when Michael fires. Blam! Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and Michael fires again, blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway. Jeep watches the baby sail slowly through the air. Jeep dives for the baby, catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground. And then he looks up to see the dark silhouette of a man approaching from out of the spectral light. A man with wings. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the fierce angel steps into the diner. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision. And now that we see his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking mace in his powerful hands. And the world returns to normal speed as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls! Clang! The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally cracking the ground. Gabriel brings the mace up again. With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael grabs Jeep's hand before the boy can rush back into the fray. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words. And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the keys to Michael's Police Cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the baby.",
    "1324": "Michael slowly approaches Gabriel, who raises the mighty mace above his head, prompting Michael to close his eyes as buzzing surrounds them. Meanwhile, Jeep gives the jeep some gas, but the engine isn't catching just as a dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car. The light reveals the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall Santa Claus, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner toward the source of a clicking sound, stepping behind the counter to find Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. The creature realizes the clicking sound is coming from Bob's silver Zippo, which Bob is focusing every last ounce of life to light. Bob looks at Gabriel, and with one last brush of his thumb, the tiny flame dances in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel's eyes go wide as he spins and runs like hell while the gas explodes, causing a massive explosion that rocks the slow-moving vehicle. Jeep swings the gun around and BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down. Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without risking hitting Audrey as Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car. Jeep ducks as the car swerves madly and the flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July. Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield and nails him right in the face, setting him on fire. That gives Jeep the chance to swing around and fire. He holds onto the car with an iron grip and starts to pull himself back in. Jeep pulls the trigger again and CLICK. Jeep brings it up to fire, but Gabriel is too fast and knocks Audrey into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. Gabriel is now clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again. Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep punches it, and the speedometer leaps ahead. Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire. The cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation.",
    "1325": "Michael slowly turns around and Estevez rushes in to restrain him, grabbing his wrist, fingers tightening. Michael moves swiftly, breaking the cop's arm and spinning him around, turning him into a human shield. Now in charge, Michael holds a gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. The street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, heels clicking the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. His eyes snap open, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion, but Michael seems to know exactly who he's talking to. Burton shoots his partner in the head, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael is faster, already firing back. Bullets rip up the concrete and the squad car window shatters, Burton's chest exploding, and down he goes, leaving Michael the only one left standing, smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and floors it, roaring away, as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him, plunging the entire city into darkness.\n\nBolts awake, breathing hard, covered with sweat. Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight. A couple of ancient Silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors creaks open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness. A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign. Jeep turns to see Charlie, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She approaches Jeep, sees the strain in his eyes. He struggles for a moment, nods. A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face. Jeep turns away, dejected. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside. Bob Hansen (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.",
    "1328": "Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter. Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE ROOM. The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. Jeep snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face him. Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE. Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands. Gladys rockets straight at him! But Jeep's too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end. A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His gun's still cocked. Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. Sandra is on the floor with her husband. Blood pours freely from his neck. Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation -- then he rushes to help. Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck. A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL. They're black. Undulating. Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield . And that's when they realize it hose aren't clouds. The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint. Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling. He can't get the words out. Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front . Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling, gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help. Percy races for the back. Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.",
    "1333": "The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. The camera rises up to find Javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. Behind Javert, through the storm rain, we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. Foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray. With a last great heave, the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. He stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. Javert approaches Jean Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches the overseer. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. Valjean hesitates. The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. Amazed, Valjean looks up. Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. Valjean kneels in the church. Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church.",
    "1335": "Bullets fly and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café Musain. Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him, but a cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and soldiers storm through. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments, while the soldiers below fire up at them. Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. The students' ammunition runs out, and they hurl sticks and bottles, but the soldiers find a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students fall. Valjean has Marius in his arms and hides him from the onrush of the soldiers. Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. The soldiers break through to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him, the soldiers hesitate. Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head. Valjean meets his eyes. He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain. He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the night sky. Here he stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river. The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents swirl round the piles of the bridge. He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he wants some angel from on high to save him, and so, turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close over him. And he's lost. Women move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both the middle-class mothers of the students, Enjolras's mother, Grantaire's sister, and the working women of the slums for whom they died, united now in their grief. Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. There stands Cosette, waiting for him. Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the house.",
    "1340": "Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses. Then he sees a nearby lamp bracket. The narrow street turns and opens out onto the river. They follow it round a corner to find a dead end. Valjean stops. A high wall before them. They're trapped. Valjean looks round. Once on the top, he hauls Cosette up by the rope. A cloister. As he sings he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city. The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH. Still running with Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting after to hear his political lecture. The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd. The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd. A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. A priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys. In the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome Marius. The occupant of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius' Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity. Mounted Police ride in to break up the crowd. Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down, furious. Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage. Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His eye is caught by the ring on his finger. CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest. Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.",
    "1342": "Marius rushes down the street with Eponine following, reaching the far end where the walled garden behind Valjean's house is located. Cosette sees Marius and comes up the garden path towards him. She holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands, eyes on Marius, who wraps his hands around hers. Eponine looks on and suffers. Valjean comes to the door, goes to the gate, and opens it. Eponine screams, which Valjean hears from his bedroom window. Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows as Eponine's scream ends. Valjean comes back to Cosette, then runs into her room and takes her in his arms before leaving to start packing. Cosette feverishly scribbles a letter and hurries down the garden to the gate, putting the folded letter in the grill where her and Marius' hands entwined. Eponine steps forward, opens the letter, reads it, then hides it in her pocket. She stands outside Marius' door as he looks up, then he is seen by the empty house. The narrative intercuts between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden. Meanwhile, Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a barmaid, and Madame Hucheloup sews a red revolutionary flag to help the students. Javert briefs a hundred uniformed police about the coming day. Monsieur and Madame Thenardier watch a student smuggle rifles upstairs. Grantaire reluctantly goes upstairs where Enjolras and the students make bullets. Marius enters, takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup, and joins the students. Joly collects empty tankards and melts them to make more bullets. Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout as Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole. Javert speaks to his men at the police station. Enjolras and Marius hold their flag at the first floor window with the students behind them, and citizens spill out of the Cafe Musain into the street, joining in the final chorus. The leaders of a great funeral procession come into view, followed by an entire battalion of infantry marching with weapons reversed, and a division of cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers.",
    "1348": "The boys are scared as they watch the creature hold Woodward tight, lift him, and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears, and mouth. Joe stands and looks intently at the screen. Just then, a muffled shatter-crash occurs. Suddenly, BOOM! The doors burst open and armed commandos enter. Earlier, Donny gets stoned in his car and doesn't notice the movement in the distance behind him as the military comes in. In the locker hallway, the boys are handcuffed and scared, being led out by armed soldiers. Nelec moves to them, and Overmyer checks their pockets. Nelec takes Cary's backpack, opens it, and pulls out some fireworks. Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple of coins, half a pack of Bubble Yum, and his mother's necklace, then drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked, and is on the verge of tears as Overmyer pockets the necklace. The terrified boys are ushered away and put onto the bus. The scene then shifts to Donny's car in the foreground, where Donny, sunk deep in his seat and hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus drives away. His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to channel 9, grabs the mike, and speaks quietly, frantic. Meanwhile, Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area, and Preston reads Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. Suddenly, Jack is there, grabs Preston, and pulls him up. Nelec moves back, and Overmyer, who sits near the front, puts on his dark gloves. Nelec sits, revealing another Airman, Hernandez, sitting at the back of the bus. The four boys sit cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired safety glass, all looking terrified. Glass! The entire bus is rocked, Charles screams, hurt, and Nelec falls, hits a bench. The bus was hit so hard it rides for a moment only on its two left wheels. The military driver struggles with the wheel, and the bus slams back onto the road loudly, blowing a tire. The kids panic as the hobbled bus still drives. Cary looks past the camera, terrified, and Charles scrambles to unlatch his seatbelt. BAAAM!!! The bus is slammed so hard that windows shatter, Charles and Cary, seatbelts removed, land on Joe and Martin. The three soldiers hit the window-floor painfully, Hernandez so hard he's instantly out. Nelec rises, scared but pissed. The rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation, and the creature comes around the other side, climbs onto the exposed side, metal and window crunching.",
    "1358": "Izzy opens another car hood to find pieces missing. As Jack heads back to his car, three residents move towards him and walk with him, ad lib. He stops, noticing four military trucks driving past slowly, with antennas atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by this. Meanwhile, Joe rides along a hillside, parks his bike, and walks toward the edge. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and others convene. Joe has heard something and dropped his flashlight, causing the men to turn and fall silent, putting Joe on the spot. Later, Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching \"In Search Of\" and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. In a middle of nowhere wooded area, an Ohio Power cherry picker truck drives up and parks beside a utility pole. Rooney, 49, with a cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard and glances at the power line. He doesn't understand what he sees and radios in. At a loud town meeting, two-hundred frustrated citizens crowd the auditorium. Jack stands at the podium, with town officials, including the local mayor, sitting on stage as well. Mrs. Babbitt, 52, speaks into the microphone on the floor, and the town roars its approval. Jack tries to speak, but the town erupts in agreement. A short, bald man of 65, Mr. McCandless, speaks next. The mayor takes over as Jack has a sidebar meeting with Mr. Jack continues, and a dolly fast shot shows an exasperated Jack writing, tailed by someone. He heads for his office, seeing Louis being escorted out by an officer across the room. Louis heads out, and Jack turns, enters his office. The door opens to Joe's messy, motherless room, where Joe and Alice enter. Joe is self-conscious and moves stacks of comics, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed, and closes the closet, hanging a bath towel on his desk chair. Alice looks around as she enters and sits on the bed. Joe takes the five-car train model, and Alice moves close to hold it. Joe watches her as she really looks at it. Their tension is interrupted by an out-of-breath Charles. Jack, with Officer Tally (24), looks at a map on his desk with 28 dots in a circle, anywhere from a 20 to 150-mile radius, with Lillian at the center. Jack is stunned. Officer Rosko is at his desk with a young woman, a ham radio, and a reel-to-reel tape deck, taking notes. Behind the camera, Cary films as Charles stands beside him. As it continues, Alice is behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling.",
    "136": "Nehru suffers as the others laugh. He has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who has stopped dead at the sight of the car while walking from one somnolent building to another. Nehru looks around the ashram a little dismally. Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes, with Nehru and his friends sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river flows, and in the background, the business of the ashram goes on. Nehru's smile is sardonic but genuine, while his friends smile embarrassed and self-consciously. Gandhi finishes the last potato, glances at Nehru, and drops the potato in the bowl. He lifts the pail of peelings to Nehru, who, in his fine linen suit, takes the pail awkwardly. His friends watch with amusement but rise to follow as they head for the kitchen. Gandhi re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, keeping right on talking. They reach the trough, and Gandhi meets Nehru's gaze; for a moment, something deeper than argument passes between them. Then, something catches Gandhi's eye, and he looks off. Ba stands watching him, waiting. Gandhi turns, noticing the goat reaching for his bowl of potatoes. He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen. Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness and humor, but hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. They watch Gandhi carry his bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of potatoes. Clothes are dipped in the brownish water as Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river, washing clothes. It is long past the monsoons, and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water, but they are laughing at their task. Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat. The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself. He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. Ba sits at one side in the shadows, watching him as intently as Gandhi. His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving and trying desperately not to show it. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train. From its distant glow, we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be. The station house.",
    "1361": "Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to. She walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite and they all laugh. Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager. Abby looks worried, nods, and rips out an extra two feet of floss. She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony PROFILE and PHOTO. Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy. There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out another piece of paper and hands it to him. She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish. He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles, then drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books. Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth and mimes swallowing. WE PAN off the television to the bed, where Abby now watches, appalled. Mike hangs up the phone. Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing. WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike continues his rant. Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed. Mike bowls over LAUGHING. Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room. Dori and Josh are already there. ON TV: Mike's face appears. Joy looks at Abby. Abby holds up a piece of paper. Stuart takes the memo, reading it. Abby spins to face Stuart. Abby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria. A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears. Abby glares at him. He stares at her, surprised. Abby gags as she pushes past him and walks out. Abby strides down the hall with Georgia and Larry. Mike gives a cocky wave. Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. In the control room, Abby smirks. Cliff shrugs. In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out. Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet. Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. She hands him the cake box, gives him a kiss on the cheek, and he grins. She fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear. He crosses to a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside the table, a man plays violin.",
    "1365": "Debbie gets out of the shower, and Pete follows her. He sneaks down the hallway and kisses Sadie (13) as he wakes her. She wants to be left alone, but Pete breathes all over her as he talks. He then lifts a sleeping Charlotte (8) out of bed and walks her downstairs, looking ridiculous because she is too tall to be carried like a baby. Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons and streamers. Pete occasionally sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth. The house is a bit more cluttered and messier than before. Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette while Sadie watches Lost on her iPad. Pete clears the breakfast dishes and turns on the faucet, pouring water on a cupcake. Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard, and Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes. Debbie is in workout gear, and Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with logos. Debbie leaves, and Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite. Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer Jason, with her friend Barb trailing behind. Pete is seen in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente with his friend Barry. A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting him, and Pete bangs on the back of the car. Debbie does sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down, and Barb stretches on a yoga ball in the background. Jason demonstrates exercises. Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone time to delay their return home. The family is driving, and Sadie watches an episode of Lost on an iPad, staring at it. A violent scene plays, and Charlotte grabs for Sadie's iPad, then starts trying to lick her. Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street, entering their store where their two employees, Jodi and a new, gorgeous employee, Desi, who is up on a ladder. Debbie goes behind the register and looks at Jodi, while Pete stares at Desi on the ladder. Pete walks over to Debbie, and Desi comes down to help a customer at the front of the store. We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside, doing a full flip and landing on her feet. Pete is nowhere to be found, and Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking.",
    "1367": "Debbie is getting a mammogram when the machine clamps too hard on her breast, causing her to scream. Later, she undergoes a colonoscopy and has some sort of very painful oral surgery, which leaves her a little high from the laughing gas. Meanwhile, Pete gets his testicles examined and has Dr. Bowe's finger inside his anus for a prostate exam. Debbie visits the gynecologist, Dr. Pelligrino, the same one from the beginning of Knocked Up, with her legs up in stirrups, and two nurses enter the exam room. At home, Debbie comes into the bedroom while Sadie runs down the hallway, and Charlotte tries to open the locked door. Debbie gives Pete a blow job out of frame, leaving him sitting on a chair, super happy. Outside, Charlotte shoves Sadie, escalating into a physical fight with muffled screams. Pete walks to the front door, where his father, Larry, greets him. A low flying 747 indicates they live too close to the airport in a small house. Pete sits down and talks with Larry as two other identical children enter and jump on Larry before the three exit. Larry stands up and walks outside, followed by Pete. Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose but sprays Pete instead. Larry's wife, Claire, enters, and Larry gets up and walks outside again. A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess and sees Oliver sitting stiffly at a table. Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos before exiting. Debbie picks up his iPhone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family. The family relaxes at dinner, with Charlotte using an app that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's. Sadie gets up and stomps off, walking away. Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway, pulling up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna. Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise and runs into the bathroom, looking for a cookie. They both eat the cookie and sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time, staring through each other in a haze, stoned. They laugh, have a good time, jump up and down on the bed, and fall down kissing. Almost totally under the covers, they watch as a waiter brings in a room service cart full of food. Pete does magic tricks for the waiter, and Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter before eating a bite of the banana.",
    "1374": "Fred said something. They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheers. The room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles. Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously. The Durmstrang crowd cheers. Another name comes out. The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out. Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage. People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads. Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts in and grabs Harry. Harry is silent. A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed colorfully. The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group. She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands. She takes Harry by the hand into a closet. An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins to read. The owl nips Harry's finger. The fire flares up a little, a face appears in it. Ron enters the room. Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them. Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry are not on speaking with each other. Hermione walks up to Harry. Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest. Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big red flower. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid. Harry does as he's told. A huge flame fires up. We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow background. As Harry walks along other pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs past. Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way. They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl off more insults. Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them. Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree. Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret. Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs. Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back to normal. Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him. Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.",
    "1375": "The crowds are cheering and people are taking bets. Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door whispering in, then enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes and Rita Skeeter, the journalist, approaches. Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters. The champions gather around him in a circle. Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon. Viktor takes another one out. Cedric picks one. Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon. The cannon fires immediately. Harry is sitting alone nervously, then enters the rocky arena. The crowd is cheering his name. He sees the golden egg sitting alone, makes a run for it but the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena. He summons a broom, jumps on, and flies off, the dragon giving chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look stunned. Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings. The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom; he lands on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area with a bridge, flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon crashes into it and falls into the water. The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg. Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering. The Weasley twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders. Seamus hands Harry the golden egg. Ron appears in the doorway. Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink from his mouth. They laugh at him. A young boy walks up holding a package. Nigel is gazing at Harry, then leaves. Hermione laughs. Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem a lot more excited. They try. She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance. He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd. The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all still seated. Neville stands. Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together. They laugh together and have a moment. Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around. Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head.",
    "1378": "Harry sees something shining in the distance and moves towards it. Viktor tries to zap him but misses. Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at Viktor's body as if to finish him off, but Harry runs up and intervenes. They struggle. The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric is pinned down with no means of escape. Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps him up. The wind starts blowing again. Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain. We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby. Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric. Cedric lays dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and traps him. Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on. A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it into the cauldron. He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron. He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts. Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops fall into it. The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges. Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply. Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been summoned. Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand. Harry struggles to get free. Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams. Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic. Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain. Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away. Harry takes steps toward Voldemort. They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle. Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks angry. Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. Harry weeps on Cedric's body. Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught. Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is in the room still sobbing. They sit. Harry nods. We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking. Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles and struggles to find one. A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.",
    "1382": "As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick and pokes a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms. We look upward, seeing the tops of the trees etched against the darkening sky. Bats fly toward us. We follow one, when Buckbeak snags one. A tail twitches briefly between his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone. Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening shadows. Hermione looks at Harry. Hermione nods, not wanting to press Harry further, then glances beyond the trees, toward the Whomping Willow. Shadows emerge under a full moon: Black, Harry, Pettigrew, Lupin, Hermione, Ron, Sleepwalking Snape. Harry studies himself and Sirius. Hermione glances toward the Willow. Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is frozen. OWWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her. Just then, a chill wind rises. The leaves of the trees tremble. Eerie shadows flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke. Dementors. Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop. The Lake begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone. She looks. Desperately, her eyes flash to the cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the water's edge, dying. Harry's face changes. He draws his wand. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake. A wisp of silver escapes his wand, hovering like a mist, then blooms magnificently. The trees explode with light. The Lake blazes with reflected fire. Harry stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the lake, the Dementors retreat. Harry waits, still as a statue, until each and every one is gone. Then he simply lets his arm drop. WHOOSH! Harry and Hermione plunge into frame astride Buckbeak, soaring toward the castle. Hermione contemplates this. Sirius paces within a small cell, a man condemned. Stunned to see them. KA-BOOM! The cell door rockets to the sky. Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye. With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the door. As Harry and Hermione enter, they catch the faintest glimpse of themselves across the room just as they evaporate. Ron blinks. Turns. Frowns. Ron glances to the other side of the room. Hermione glances mischievously to Harry. Harry jumps. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes. The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk. Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his shock at Lupin's appearance. Harry eyes the open desk drawers, the bare bookshelves.",
    "1383": "Harry turns back, sensing something in the shadows across the street. He rises and slowly draws his wand. Then he sees it—something big, darker than the shadows which conceal it. Something with wide, gleaming eyes. Harry steps back, afraid to look, wand outstretched. He trips, tumbles over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand blazes. BANG! Twin beams of blinding light spear the night. Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly. As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street—now simply shadows—and climbs aboard. Only beds are inside. In one bed, a disheveled wizard grunts, turns over in his sleep. BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds—as one—slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest, peers up at the chandelier swaying directly above his head. Beyond the windscreen, oncoming traffic whips past in a blur. Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once more. Stan grins with sinister delight, showing bad teeth. As the Shrunken Head cackles with delight, Harry peers out the windscreen, watches London careering by. Sure enough, directly ahead, a little old lady is crossing the street. Ernie hits the brakes hard and Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets forward once more. As Harry rights himself, he notices the headline of Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair glowers from a moving photograph. Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face. Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Just then, a pair of double-decker buses sweep directly toward the Knight Bus. Before he can scream, the entire Knight Bus squeezes down and shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces. As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are revealed. Harry glances up, reads the sign above: THE LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a flick of his wand, silences the car alarm. Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The bartender glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A solitary wizard reads a book while, at his elbow, his coffee cup stirs itself. Tom leads Harry upstairs. As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a snow white owl (Hedwig) perched atop a chair. Harry turns, finds a pinstriped silhouette (Cornelius Fudge) at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of walnuts from his pocket and—CRACK—crushes the shells between his palms.",
    "1386": "Hermione reads over the shoulders of others as a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face. BEM, a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of Black. Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then slowly begin to wither. The dew freezes, the grass grows brittle. Seconds later, the Dementors sweep by. A tall wardrobe rattles violently as Harry, Ron, and several classmates regard it warily. Ron jumps, glances at Hermione, then whispers to Harry. Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward queasily. Everyone laughs good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully, leans close to Neville, and whispers. Neville's eyes pop open in shock. He considers Lupin uncertainly, then nods nervously and takes a deep breath. Sparks jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe bursts open. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs away in fright, turns, and sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a Dementor. Harry starts to raise his wand, then freezes, transfixed. The Dementor looms closer and closer, when Lupin steps between, snaps his wand. Lupin studies him curiously. Harry looks up, finds Lupin studying him. Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles. Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles vaguely. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances, when Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen. The students dash to the landing, where all the paintings whisper fearfully. Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows, then narrow. Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own, trembling. As the students react, Dumbledore's voice cuts through. Clock Tower Door: Great groaning tumblers fall. Spindles rotate. Cylinders—one after another—fire into place. Windows: Iron spikes, sharp as razors, rise instantly. One by one, deep in the distance, the lights of the Great Hall go out. Dementors appear, covering frame, then separate like a curtain. The camera drifts through the silent room, over an ocean of sleeping bags, finds Harry lying awake, staring at the net of stars glimmering beyond the highest window. A gentle creak is heard and Harry's eyes shift, see Snape pass through the great doors, converge with Dumbledore. Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the bait. As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over the slumbering students. As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes, feigns sleep. As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy finishes scrawling something on a bit of parchment and balls it up in his hands. As he opens them, a moth flutters from his palms.",
    "1387": "Snape waves the moth away, blows out a candle and a slide show begins. An ancient woodcut of a horrific beast flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at his book. As the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry. A tiny cloud of moth dust mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm. Malfoy's parchment has reappeared. Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being struck by lightning over and over. Harry opens his eyes and Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione slowly come into focus, standing at the foot of his bed in the hospital wing. As Harry edges up against his pillow, we see a nurse in the background, removing the spokes of an umbrella from a Hufflepuff player's neck. Uncomfortable glances. He tips a bag of splintered wood and twisted twigs onto the bed. As Harry stares, we hear a gentle wind, then. Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question, then -- WHOOSH! -- sets Hedwig free of her traces. As she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the lake's edge. The great doors open and Fred and George enter. The invisibility cloak drops and Harry is revealed, looking cross. Instantly, Fred slaps a worn roll of parchment into his hand. Harry unfurls it. It's blank. George touches his wand to the parchment and intricate ink lines surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. Harry reads the curious words at the top. Trapdoor lifts. Harry's eyes appear. As he pulls himself up, a door bangs open. Quickly, Harry hides, watches a man's boots descend the stairs. Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust. SPLAT! Malfoy takes a snowball to the grill. Splutters. Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT! SPLAT! -- he takes two more. Hermione and Ron glance about uneasily. Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when -- FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully, eying the mist. Malfoy's ski mask is pulled over his eyes, he's spun about, given a rough kick to the ass and sent stumbling over the rise and out of sight. Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance, and DASH OFF. When -- FLUMPH! -- they both go flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up, they hear laughter. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion. The invisibility cloak drops. Harry grinning. But he's smiling. The trio trudge through the swirling snow.",
    "1389": "Snape turns and sees Lupin standing in the shadows. Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions. Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map fiercely. Harry walks silently and lingers briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn away but stops. Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers. As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her eyes. Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably -- seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the doorway. Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry watches him go, along with the others, then spies Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts to go, when the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then, a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds Harry stiffens. When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Harry's shoulder. Her hand. Harry shakes his head. Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we fade out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we -- cut to HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut. She and Ron look and SEE Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind. The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and Ron sit. The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun. High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.",
    "139": "Gandhi has remained seated, pensive. Charlie studies him a moment. A little grin appears on Gandhi's face, but his mood remains pensive and remote. Gandhi looks up, his anger and determination evident, but then he sighs hopelessly. Charlie is stunned and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more gently. Charlie now understands. Gandhi smiles with warmth and sadness. He then speaks with a determined purposefulness and a friend's trust. He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie. He nods. Gandhi meets his eyes with a smile that shelters Charlie's vulnerability and returns his love. The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions. The courtroom is packed to overflowing and restless. Gandhi sits in the dock. The magistrate, who is English, is surveying the courtroom and signals his clerk, who is also English, to him. The magistrate frowns. The front row is seen from his point of view, with two or three Indian journalists and one European. The magistrate receives that news with some alarm. He indicates that the clerk take his place. Gandhi stands. The courtroom is silent, but the sound of the chanting outside can still be heard. The magistrate stares. The journalists write. The clerk swallows. The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside. The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands for an answer. Again, the magistrate stares. So do the journalists. The magistrate wets his lips. The court explodes. In the chaos of cheering and delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room, and heads for his chambers. The journalists are scribbling furiously. Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom. Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony. A huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles down at them, he is turned by surprise and caution. Gandhi reacts with surprise and caution again. It sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even angry. The Governor, Sir Edward Gait, with the portrait of the King prominent behind him, is feeling as cornered as Sir George but for different reasons. His desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of folders, all with exactly the same covers, and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers. He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand. Sir George looks at him, half defensive, half defiant. They are old friends, the same school, the same social class, long together in India, and their argument is an argument between friends who accept the same premises. But even so, the Governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly.",
    "143": "The crowd is running and screaming. He looks off at the crowd, his eyes narrowing. A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, some disappearing, a few heroic individuals astride the wall reaching down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below. Dyer glances woodenly at the panel, a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise. The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief, more at his attitude than his statement. He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point. The evasiveness and half-buried embarrassment of their response only deepens his own withdrawal into himself. Dyer thinks about it. There is a muted reaction from the public section. The Indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes. For the first time, there is a hint of uncertainty in his manner. There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel. Dyer looks at him quickly. That answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly. Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut. Quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry. The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety. And finally, the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. He is surveying the wall in the now-empty park numbly, desolately. Nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, the same benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its pan—bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, little pieces of clothing. The imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India. Chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference table. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader. The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer—coolly, but accepting it. That lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little. It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry. The British are stunned almost to speechlessness—the audacity, the impossibility of it—and from Gandhi of all people. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover. Gandhi and the others just look at him. Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.",
    "144": "He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this. His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side. He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them. The top is lifted, whiskey pours. The camera pulls back. We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed. The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours. And they all laugh. There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused. It is an instruction they all find correct. A roar of approval from a huge crowd. We are featuring two British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform. Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd. It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos. In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills. We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly. Gandhi holds up one finger. Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it. Now Gandhi raises a third finger. And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture as before. This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out across them as though seeking something. There is an excited stir; he silences it. As suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile. Featuring the two British soldiers -- later -- on the edge of the crowd, staring off, their faces now brightly lit by darting flames. A huge triangular pile burns before the platform, an excited half-naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it.",
    "147": "Gandhi struggles to turn, and Mirabehn helps him. When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them. She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher. She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip. Gandhi swallows with difficulty. He pauses, letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again. He tries to smile. Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability. Gandhi signals her down to him. She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear. We intercut their faces, very close, as he speaks. During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion. She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught. Her point of view. The doorway. Nehru stands in it. Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him. It is a victory. Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin. And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time. He buries his head on Gandhi's hand, clutching it to him. Bright sunshine. A little boy is pulling a goat by a tether. He turns with a bright smile. Gandhi is walking, holding Ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and Mirabehn's with the other. Nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity. It stops Nehru. He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn. He laughs and Nehru struggles to join in the joke. A quiet hum in a packed courtroom. Armed sepoys line the wall. Featuring Judge Broomfield and the clerk. The Judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face. At last, he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk. The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice. The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench. The courtroom immediately falls silent. The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly. He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly. As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi. Featuring two English court reporters. One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge. The clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands. A disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them. The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all.",
    "156": "Azad takes a step forward. Gandhi looks up at him. For a moment, he folds his hands absently, then he stands and moves to Ba's side and kneels. Ba's eyes flutter open. She holds her hand out to him and he takes it. When he goes to release it, she clutches it. Gandhi hesitates, and then he sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap. He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go. Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell and stands. Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him and go down the corridor with Azad. He looks back. Gandhi is sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare. A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway. He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears. He puts the acoustic bell over her heart. A moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi. His posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks. The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal, stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead -- and the living, for Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never move again. Mirabehn watches him, her face wet with tears. A piece of cloth shimmers in a stiff breeze. For a moment, we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder. Slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant on the nose of an aircraft. The aircraft stops before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door.",
    "160": "Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at Gandhi's eyeline. Gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look, and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru. His hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him. Gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand. He does so with effort, and at last he sees Patel. Patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of them are on a level. Outside the canopied area, Bourke-White is crouched, her camera framing the three of them. Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him. Gandhi shakes his head. But Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair. Bourke-White captures the sense of elation in his face. From her discreet distance, she lowers the camera, holding it against her mouth, waiting for Gandhi's response. Gandhi nods to Nehru, accepting the news with a sad wistfulness. He glances at Patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced. Nehru turns back -- this time no confidence, only concern. Gandhi smiles, pain etched in his eyes. He touches Nehru's hand. Nehru stares at him, feeling the sudden fear that Gandhi means it. Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White are gripped by the same realization. An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, grown even larger now, and more women among them. The crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move. We see, just in passing, the frightened, apprehensive faces of Godse, and near him, Apte and Karkare. Nehru stands, staring at them all, his face seething with anger. On the cover is a picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut-out of Gandhi lying on his cot. Mirabehn is rising, leaving the magazine at her feet. She moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad ushers them into the canopied area. Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background. Mirabehn speaks softly. Nehru looks across at Gandhi. The doctor, who is testing Gandhi's pulse yet again, glances at him -- no encouragement -- and moves away. Nehru moves to the side of the cot and Gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain. Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods. Gandhi looks back at Nehru. Gandhi smiles whimsically, he touches him again but there is no change in his attitude. Nehru looks at him hopelessly. A huge crowd, some smoke in distant buildings, some damage near to help us know this is still Calcutta, and all is not yet at peace.",
    "162": "He holds up his hand for attention, then forces a smile and starts reading. It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on, louder, but just as colorlessly. This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both now. He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant. And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire. The flames engulf it. The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture. He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd. It is the end of the speech. He looks at the crowd. Gandhi harrumphs, gesturing to a shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely. He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame. He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club menacingly against his hand. Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's, and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another. Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts, and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, but the other women seize her.",
    "163": "In silence and an air of somnolence, the police commissioner Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others are present. Nearer Gandhi, behind Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad, and Pyarelal. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes. His weary eyes look at her, then slowly up to Azad. Gandhi looks at Nehru, who nods tautly. Gandhi looks down, then lifts his head to Azad. Relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces. Nehru bends to Gandhi, who holds his hand out to him; Nehru clutches it. Another click of a camera sounds. Gandhi is not fully recovered but is well on the way. A wide-angle shot shows Bourke-White shooting one of her favorite subjects again. She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor. Pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this. Bourke-White shoots Gandhi again as he hands the cloth back to Manu. Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's. Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see; it's one of him, ears wide, eyes round. Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles. Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words. Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti. He glances at it and holds his arms out. The two girls help him. Bourke-White is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls. He moves off but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel. Patel nods soberly, and Gandhi starts for the door, Bourke-White moving with him. He has passed her; he's in the doorway. The crowd is at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften. He turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women. She shoots him against the door—the crowd milling distantly, waiting—then she lowers her camera. He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them. Bourke-White watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance. She turns to Mirabehn. Mirabehn accedes gravely. Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him. Mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face. Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha.",
    "166": "The magazine Indian Opinion is printed in a tent filled with stacks of the publication. A short Westerner named Albert West runs the simple printing press, powered by a crude generator, with the help of a small staff comprising a Sikh, a Muslim, a couple of Hindus, and two young boys. Gandhi and Walker approach the tent from the river, with Gandhi speaking earnestly. Upon reaching the entrance, Gandhi gestures inside, directing his last remark towards Charlie Andrews, who sits nearby at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter. Gandhi shouts out to the staff over the noise of the generator, and they acknowledge him with a nod and a bow from one of the Hindus. Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion, and they start across a barren field toward other tents, Walker glancing at the paper. Gandhi watches him, grinning, their exchange carrying a weight and apprehension not present in the rest of the conversation. Walker looks at Gandhi with a little surprise, sensing Gandhi's reluctant commitment to an ineluctable fact. They pass by a construction site where a European named Kallenbach, wearing a Star of David on his chest, is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, using a level. Indians work below him, and Gandhi turns to him, becoming light-hearted again. Walker waves his notebook at Kallenbach, who lifts his level in greeting. Walker looks around, grinning and shaking his head, noticing two women in saris cleaning a toilet. He looks at Gandhi appraisingly, then starts toward a half-finished building with wooden sides and a door but canvas covering the roof, an awning spread before it. Walker's carriage is tethered nearby, with a Black driver standing in the sun, waiting. In the background, two women are cleaning a latrine, which Walker glances at. Ba looks at him coldly before turning back and walking into the building through the rear entrance. Gandhi, disconcerted by her attitude, tries to answer Walker but forces a grin. When a girl named Sora comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls to the driver and enters the building to find the source of Ba's aloofness. Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance. Gandhi crosses to stand in front of her, his voice hushed but bristling with suppressed anger, aware that Walker might overhear them. Ba looks at him hostilely.",
    "168": "Another cheer subsides, and Tyeb Mohammed rises near the back, where he is seated with a number of other young men. The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back. Gandhi waits, then looks at the audience. This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know. He looks down at the police, making the point stick. There is a tentative reaction from the audience, but uncertain. He has their attention now. And now he gets the response he has wanted. Firm, mature, determined. He holds up his hand and looks at the audience. A second, then a merchant stands, signifying his pledge. Then Tyeb Mohammed and the youths about him. Then all over the theater they begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is standing. Gandhi looks at the full theater -- all standing. He takes a step forward. A prison door slams: we are close on one face, another slam, another face, and again and again in the rhythm of marching feet. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed are leading a large procession of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex -- sheds, elevator platforms, pulleys -- toward a distant city. Tyeb Mohammed suddenly touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead. A canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings and comes towards them. There is a little hesitation in the ranks as the car approaches. In it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian. The car swings across the center of the road and stops right in front of Gandhi. The civilian smiles slowly. He looks from Gandhi to the miners. The civilian looks at him sharply, then smiles derisively, signaling the car off. As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh come up to Gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired. Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns and signals the miners on. They start forward. The car rides on past the factory building out of which it turned, and suddenly mounted police come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession. Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored. Tracking back before the mounted police. They come on fast, batons at the ready. Gandhi screws up his courage, marching on. Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance. Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side. The mounted police riding on, batons at the ready. He is in the front rank of the procession, watching the horses approach. He has a blunt farmer's face.",
    "169": "Chili watches a woman on the sidewalk pause to tighten the scarf around her neck, then turns to study Tommy. Tommy looks at him as he gets up from the table, the other men around the table following his lead as he finishes up some jokes. Chili merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day. A moment later the MANAGER, an old Italian guy in a black suit, joins him in the doorway. The Manager looks OFF SCREEN, and begins speaking in Italian. Chili stares straight ahead, rubs his hands together, tries to stay warm. Tommy drives as Chili points out the window. Tommy looks up at the hotel as Chili takes a pair of leather gloves from top of the dash, opens the door. As Tommy pulls up out front, Chili knocks on the door three times. He waits, pulls the right-hand glove on tight, so that when RAY BONES opens the door, Chili nails him one punch. Chili and Tommy each sit in a barber chair, reading the newspaper while Fred and Ed sit nearby playing checkers. A car pulls up. Chili's no longer listening to Tommy, but now watching as Ray Bones and a BLACK GUY get out of the car. Ray Bones eyes Chili, then nods to Fred and Ed. Tommy looks over as Ray Bones - smaller bandage on the top of his head - and his man enter the shop. The two guys leave as the Black Guy steps up to Chili. Chili exchanges a look with Tommy, watches as 'Mr Bones' goes down the hall into the back office, then turns to the black guy. Ray Bones comes out with the collection book open, looking at all of the names of who owes what. Ray Bones steps over to Chili. Ray Bones checks his man to get some appreciation, but the guy's too busy looking at the hair rinses and shit on the counter. Tommy watches as the Black Guy picks up a pair of scissors, runs his hand along the edge. Ray throws the book at Chili and walks out, his man right behind him. Ray Bones then nods to his man who grabs Chili, holds the point of the scissors to Chili's throat. Chili looks over at Tommy. Where Chili sits with FAY DEVOE - thirties, attractive, in a sundress - on her patio. They each have a drink. She looks at him. Touches her drink to the side of her face. They sit there in silence a moment. Fay reaches over, puts a hand on his leg. Chili finishes his drink, sets it down. She finally looks at Chili.",
    "172": "He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this, eyes Harry a beat, then pushes out of his chair and nods before getting up. Ronnie sits up straight, opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt. Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look, glances once more at Chili, then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him. Chili looks at Harry, shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, and fumbles for his cigarettes. Chili's minivan is parked out front. Obviously losing it now, Harry rubs his eyes and quickly walks off to a row of payphones. Chili sits at the desk on the phone. They consider each other a moment until Chili finally checks his watch. Karen looks caught, doesn't answer right away. Chili lets that sink in a minute. Leo sits down in the armchair, stares sadly at the briefcase, then nods. He picks up the briefcase as he rises from the sofa and Leo gets out of his chair. Chili reaches for the door, opens it, and looks back at Leo. As Chili starts for the elevator, he drives a dark road up into the park and pulls in behind a row of trailers. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone. He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut. Leo steps into his doorway. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator, stops, turns around, and says nothing before sitting down in one of the red leather chairs. Bo Catlett smiles at him but doesn't give up the script. Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script and begins flipping through it. Chili flips through the script and sees a name. Karen smiles, decides to wait a moment. Chili, lost in the movie, keeps mouthing the dialogue. As Tanya/Marlene Dietrich resumes her slow walk away, Karen sits down at the end of the row. People start getting up to leave. Chili turns to a guy a few seats away from him. The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his date, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row. She gets up, they start up the aisle together. As Karen and Chili exit the theater, they stand there a moment.",
    "183": "The camera pulls back, revealing a blood-stained butcher knife in a man's hand, then further back to show his parents staring at him, initially puzzled, then slowly growing horrified. The camera cranes up past the parents, up from the neighbor's house to a high shot of the neighborhood as police sirens rise in the distance. Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain pouring down on a lonely strip of highway. A station wagon hisses along the wet road surface. Inside, Marion, a 30-year-old woman, drives, with Sam Loomis, a tough-looking clinical psychiatrist in his forties, sitting next to her in the passenger seat, flipping through pages in a manila folder. Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette, shoves the matches into the pack, and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack before they both look up ahead, seeing a male patient, a wild-looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, standing by the side of the road. Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of the road. Loomis jumps out and, through the windshield, is seen rushing over to the patient, standing and talking for a moment, then hurrying back. The camera moves with Laurie as she walks down a residential street, carrying a large bundle of school books. Across a backyard, Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy, comes running with his books and catches up with her. They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house set back from the street. Laurie holds up a key, walks through the front gate, and starts up toward the porch. She bends down, lifts the welcome mat, and places the key under it. Through a frost window, Laurie is seen bending over the welcome mat. Suddenly, a dark shape, the outline of a man, leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at the street, the shape moves to watch them, then fades back into the interior of the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street, with Tommy breaking stride and running across the street. Laurie is seen walking off down the street in the distance, and close to the camera, the dark shape moves into frame, watching Laurie disappear around the corner. Loomis reaches a car, unlocks it, gets in, starts it up, and pulls away from the sanitarium. Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building. Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of high school students.",
    "186": "Annie's car pulls away. Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street. Brackett smiles as Loomis walks up behind him. As they talk, the camera slowly moves around them to a view of the street. Loomis' station wagon moves by behind them. Through the blowing trees, we see the full moon rising in the night sky. Annie's car moves down a quiet little residential street and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle house. We are in the front seat of the station wagon. Through the windshield, we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye, and walk up to the Doyle house. Then Annie's car makes a wide U-turn in the street and starts down the other direction. The station wagon pulls forward and follows her. Annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a garage. The station wagon stops several feet away. The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to the camera so we can't see him. He glances down the street. Gusts of wind blow the costumes of children going from house to house. The shape moves. The camera tracks behind him as he walks toward the Wallace house. The shape stops in front. We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces'. The front door opens. Through the front room windows, we can see Annie talking to the Wallaces as they put on their coats. The camera and shape quickly move behind a tree to hide from sight. The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage. The shape steps out from behind the tree and stares at the house. Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a pretty little nine-year-old, stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Annie closes the door. A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house. There are sounds of wind and chirping crickets. Brackett and Loomis get out and stand by the front gate. Inside, we see Annie turn on the TV. She goes to the mirror on the wall and begins to brush her hair. Looking down the side of the house, we see Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain gutter clangs back and forth against the house in the wind. The front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway. It is totally dark in the house. Brackett's flashlight comes on, illuminating the two men. As they move through the house, the camera tracks with them. Suddenly, Brackett stops. He trains his flashlight on a small object in the corner of the room. For a moment, Brackett doesn't speak.",
    "189": "Annie calculates a moment. Lindsey is back watching the TV Horror-thon and her eyes light up. Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house, Lindsey carrying a bowl of popcorn, and Annie has a coat over the negligee. They walk down the street to the Doyles, the wind blowing strong and whipping the negligee around Annie's legs. As the girls make their way down the street, the SHAPE steps into the glow of the streetlight and watches them. Tommy runs to answer the door and opens it to find Annie and Lindsey standing there. Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room, taking off her coat, sitting in front of the TV, and eating her popcorn. She glances at Annie's coat. Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the Horror-thon. Annie hurries across the back yard and steps into the garage, walking to her car and trying the door. Quickly she turns and walks out of the garage. Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse, finding it in the front room, taking out her brush and lipstick, and standing in front of the mirror primping. She glances up at her image in the mirror. Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for Tommy, turning around and looking for him. For a moment, he glances out the window. The figure of a MAN carries what seems to be a BODY across the Wallace's back yard. Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying. Laurie rushes in from the kitchen finding the children in tears. Tommy points out the window. Laurie bends down to comfort her. Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to the couch in front of the TV set. Almost instantly, Lindsey stops crying and follows him, sitting up next to Tommy and hugging him. Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen. The old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the hedge where Loomis sits waiting. Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Three boys, Keith, Richie and Lonnie (from the playground) creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house, staring fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure. Loomis parts the hedge in front of him and stares. For a moment Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through the front gate up toward the porch. He watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure whether he should interfere or just watch.",
    "191": "The camera ascends from the Bailey home, moving through the snowfall and towards a sky full of stars. As the camera stops, heavenly voices are heard, and with each voice, a star twinkles brightly. A small star enters from the left, stops, and twinkles as Clarence speaks. The stars fade, leaving a light, indistinguishable blur on the screen, which slowly forms into a group of young boys standing on a snow-covered hill. The boys prepare to slide down the hill on large shovels. One boy slides down and onto the ice of a frozen river, with George Bailey at the bottom. The other boys applaud as each one takes a turn sliding down. Harry makes his slide, going fast and passing the marks made by the others, but his shovel takes him onto thin ice, which breaks, causing him to disappear into the water. George jumps in, grabs Harry, and yells for help. The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain, and pull George and Harry to safety. The boys, arm in arm and whistling, walk together and notice an elaborate horse-drawn carriage on the other side of the street. They glimpse an elderly man riding in it before reaching Gower's old-fashioned drugstore with jars of colored water in the windows. George enters, crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter, makes a wish, and lights it. He then moves to the soda fountain where Mary Hatch is seated. George retrieves his apron from behind the fountain. Mr. Gower, the druggist, watches from a back room, taking a drink from a bottle. Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits at the fountain. George stands behind the soda fountain, putting on his apron.",
    "192": "He drops the phone and grabs Mary by the shoulders, shaking her. Mary begins to cry, and he pulls her into a fierce embrace. Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy. Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs and practically faints at what she sees. Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries. The camera pulls back, and the sound of the Wedding March is heard. People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, it is raining. Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the maid, are present. George and Mary are in each other's arms. Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings. The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door. He stops the cab. Scurrying people under umbrellas are swarming around the bank doors. Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close down. Several people come running past the cab. George gets out of the cab and looks down the street. George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan. They are simply-dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death. George comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear. An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and Loan. A crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill. It has been locked. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the Building and Loan. George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him. George turns back cheerfully to the crowd. George vaults over the counter. The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for him. He points to George's office. The telephone rings.",
    "196": "George waves as he exits through the door. A flaming plane crashes into the sea. George, behind the counter, is trying to quiet a crowd of people all clamoring for more ration points, and he shouts. Later, George, in the uniform of an air raid warden, is patrolling his beat. A man beside a lighted window pulls down the shade as George blows his whistle. George is helping load his old car with scrap paper while a wheelbarrow full of junk is being dumped onto a pile. It is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze as George is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper, with a large Christmas wreath draped around one arm and several more copies of the paper under his other arm. George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on the sidewalk. The front page of the paper is the Bedford Falls Sentinel, with a subhead telling of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N. on his way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries, and a picture of the transport which Harry saved. Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story. Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them. Meanwhile, Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to himself. The outer door opens and George enters the offices, which are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone, the same office force, albeit a few years older. Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man with a briefcase. Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a glimpse of the man waiting in the chair. This is Carter, the bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the Building and Loan. George gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath, and goes over to Carter. They shake hands. Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks. He grabs the paper from Potter's hand, folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man. In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward the deposit window with his deposit slip. Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, starts to punch it with rubber stamps. Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has. The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of the numerous strings tied around his fingers.",
    "199": "First, he turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. They whisper. Mary comes in and picks up the phone. George enters the shot and stands listening to her. He snatches the phone from Mary. She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand. Mary speaks quickly into the phone. But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling. Mary once more tries to take the phone from him. But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone. He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner. Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously. The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only sound being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst. There is silence in the room. Janie breaks into sobs. The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George. He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house. Mary goes to the phone, picks it up. Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow. George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials. George is out of the door by now. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Potter. George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place.",
    "202": "George regards Violet and Mary with manly disgust, seeing them as nothing more than a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter and goes to it. He gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces, and she gives him the money. Violet jumps down off her stool and exits, with Mary sticking out her tongue as she passes. George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish and pulls a magazine from his pocket, showing it to Mary. He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. She leans over, speaking softly, whispering, then draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said. George turns back to the cash register, whistling, and notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it. He puts the telegram down, a goodness of heart expressing itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower, who is drunk and intent on putting some capsules into a box. George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor, with capsules spilling at their feet. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say. He turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. George stands still, horrified, his fingers fumbling. His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George comes out into main room and with an inspiration, dashes out the door and down the street, Mary following him with her eyes. He stops as he sees Potter's carriage waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs. The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side, vibrating with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. As George is about to enter his father's office, Uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.",
    "206": "George comes running into shot as the wind blows, frantically looking for Clarence. He leans on the bridge railing, praying, and sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of this, the wind dies down and a soft, gentle snow begins to fall. A police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into scene. George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again, but then touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily, and his rapture knows no bounds. He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town. George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town, passing some late shoppers. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. George notices a light in Potter's office window, and races across the street. Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. George pounds on the window and runs off as Potter looks up from his work. The lights are on. The Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around. Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George. He comes dashing in the front door, grabs his hand and shakes it. The photographer sets off a flash bulb. George runs to the kitchen but gets no answer, so he comes running back to the hall. The three children are at the top of the stairs, in their pajamas. George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs. George and the kids are hugging. Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom. George crushes her to him. As Mary comes through the door, breathless and excited, the four men are watching with open mouths. Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace. George and Mary embrace tearfully, and he stops her with a kiss. She leads him excitedly down the stairs. Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree. She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in.",
    "207": "A very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves, is preoccupied, while Cousin Tilly answers the telephone and calls out. Uncle Billy looks at his hand, with pieces of string tied around two fingers to remind him of tasks. He opens his father's office door and enters. George's father, a gentle, idealistic man in his forties, is seated behind his desk, drawing swirls on a pad, looking tired and worried. Nearby, Henry F. Potter sits in a wheelchair pushed by a goon, wearing a squarish derby hat. A heated argument is underway. George, aware of both the business crisis and his personal one, can't bear the libel about his father. He moves in front of the desk, is pushed toward the door, and shoves Potter's shoulder as he passes. The goon restrains Potter, and George's father ushers George out, closing the door. George stands outside with capsules in hand. Meanwhile, Gower talks on the telephone, sees George in the doorway, hangs up, and drags George into the back room, hitting him about the head. Mary, seated at the soda fountain, winces at each slap. George tries to protect himself, then stumbles away, cupping his ear. Gower notices a large brown bottle not replaced on the shelf. George takes a small box from his pocket, which Gower rips away, tastes the powder from a capsule, then throws it aside. George whimpers, and Gower suddenly hugs him, sobbing. George cries too. Across the counter, Joe Hepner, the store proprietor, shows a suitcase.",
    "209": "She screams, but the noise is cut off by the swinging door. George and his mother sit down at the table. Harry sticks his head through the kitchen door. She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. George and his father eat at the table, with a great similarity and understanding between them. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head. The camera pans with them as they cross. George and Pop are at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes, then exits. Annie comes in again from the kitchen. Annie stops serving to hear his answer. She gives George a look and goes out into the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George. He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father. To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls Annie, who is listening through the glass in the door. George and his father are at the table. At one end of the room, an orchestra is playing. George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table. He and Harry are carrying plates and pies. Several of the boys take the plates from him. George looks at them, feeling very grown up and out of place. Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry and waggles his hands at his ears as he talks. George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice. Sam is assured and breezy, wearing very collegiate clothes. George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other. An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George. Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George. She is waving her dance program at him. Marty Hatch enters the scene. He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her. She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand. She turns around and for the first time she sees George. For a second she loses her poise, staring at him. George stares at Mary. Still staring at George, she smiles. Mary and Freddie are together. Marty comes into the scene, followed by George. Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing. Following George and Mary as they dance, a whistle is heard offscreen, and the music stops. Harry is on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand. As the music starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other. They start their Charleston. We see a series of shots of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. Freddie needs no more, leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George.",
    "210": "Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. George and Mary are dancing. They mistake the screams for cheers. George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool. Spotlights concentrate on them. The crowd watches George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. George and Mary are still trying to dance in the water, the crowd on the edge cheering them, some of the crowd leap into the pool, the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bathrobe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing. CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street. He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on. In his confusion, George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bathrobe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm. George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street. It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent. George hurls the rock at the house. We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass. As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand. The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the SOUND of breaking glass. Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her. George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street. Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary. They have stopped walking and now face one another.",
    "212": "The whistle of the approaching train is heard. The train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is. This young lady is Ruth Dakin, who is momentarily forgotten in the excitement of greetings and stands smiling, waiting. George and Uncle Billy stare astounded, with George being thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand and kisses her. The camera moves with them down the platform, where George stops with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot, while Harry stops with George then runs out of the shot, with George watching him. George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth, thinking deeply. The camera moves with George as he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn, nodding and smiling. Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch. Uncle Billy is tipsy and feels very high. He looks around for his hat, which is on his head. George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him. They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle around and heads him down the street. George is standing at the garden gate, obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. He takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them, and throws them away. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him. She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the music of a phonograph and can be seen through the front door. They kiss, and Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head. George is standing in the middle of the street, hands in his pockets, obviously undecided as to what he wants to do. As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a moment. Violet is locking up for the night. A couple of men are crowding around her, each one bent on taking her out. She looks up and sees George standing there. The camera pans with Violet as she crosses the street to George. Violet takes her beauty shop seriously and she's an eyeful. He looks her over. She senses the fact that George is far from immune to her attractions. She links her arm in his and continues down the street with him. They stop walking and face one another. Her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him.",
    "213": "George is silent for a moment, then blurts out. By this time, a small crowd has collected to watch the scene. Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and George is trying to quiet her. As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter. George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. But after a few steps, he turns around and starts back. George stops, startled, and looks up. George looks surprised at this. But Mary has disappeared from the window. Mary is running down the stairs. She looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon. Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. George is struggling with the gate; he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. Mary and George are in the entrance hall. They go through the doorway into the parlor. George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. George and Mary sit on the divan. There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene. He looks at his watch, as though about to leave. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. Mrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe, and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls. George and Mary are seated on the divan. George is aghast. As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing. Mary comes into the hall. As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch. George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings. She hands the instrument to George. Sam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands. As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening. Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very conscious of her proximity. Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. George can stand it no longer.",
    "217": "Pappy is considering the crowd, then drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar. Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going. The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried. He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for a considering beat. Pappy returns a considered appraisal. At the steps of the meeting hall, people stream out of the concert into the warm summer night. Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps with Penny. He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their wedding bands, but Penny's finger is bare. She walks off. His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation. Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar cries out. It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his heavy restraints. As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder. Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go. In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, slobberier. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout. As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade. Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods. They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and push them forward. Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough pine coffin. The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the porch, the drooling hound at his heels. The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas round their necks. They look to Cooley for guidance. So too does the drooling hound. The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy task. The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their shovels. Sweat glistens on them and trickles down their faces like tears. Cooley gives the faintest smile. Delmar bows his head to silently pray. Everett bows his head as well. The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell. The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more palpable than audible, the song seeming to rise out of the earth itself.",
    "220": "Delmar whistles appreciatively then lurches threateningly to his feet. Everett scrambles up and watches the white-robed people following a tenor. More white-robed figures drift through the woods, oblivious to the three men. An endless stream of them floats through the campsite. A minister stands belly-deep in the river, dunking a white-robed man. A line of robed singers lengthens as people stream out of the woods. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze at the river. White-robed people continue drifting past them. Delmar wades into the stream, cutting in line, and holds his nose as the minister lowers him into the water. A smoldering twig fire is seen. A bloodhound on a leash circles into frame, wagging its tail, and waddles to an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade. Everett drives, shaking his head with a smile. Pete and Delmar are dripping wet. Everett shakes his head and laughs. A thirtyish black man in worn clothes stands on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He grabs his guitar case as the car pulls over and trots up to the open window. Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out. Tommy shrugs. Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview. The car pulls into the parking lot of a single-story cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign. As the men get out, Everett snaps his suspenders and strides up to a portly middle-aged man with dark glasses and a white cane. Everett grimaces, thinking. The three convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, who plays his guitar into a can microphone, performing 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back. A caravan of two oversize cars pulls into the lot as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station door, whooping it up. A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by suspenders gets out of the first car. Delmar waves a fistful of money at him. A big shambling man of about thirty follows him out of the car.",
    "224": "Everett gives her an ingratiating laugh and ostentatiously fans some of his money while being watched. The big man stops chewing, slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty pat, and appears as she leaves. Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair. Everett rises and digs in his pocket. As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a tilt of the head and a crinkling smile. Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue. Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting at, then whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it. He glares around the table. Eckard grunts as he starts to rise, but Pappy whips him back down with his hat. As he settles back, Eckard looks around the table and helpfully relays. The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak. Everett, Delmar, and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of chicken off a bone, then tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs. Delmar is pleased and embarrassed, rises to his feet, and tosses down his napkin. He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off a tree, casually strips its twigs, and swings at Delmar who staggers back with a grunt. Everett wears a puzzled smile. Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up and charges Big Dan, wrapping his arms around him. Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head, then walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow to Everett, which catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling. Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away, then whacks Everett into a semi-conscious heap and paws through his pockets. He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning and kicks him several times, then takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top. Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it. He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else inside. Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes. Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist. Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips. He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against a tree.",
    "228": "Szpilman comes into the courtyard, steps across the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, their two sons and the toddler lying outside the door. He turns a corner, stops, his face blank. Furniture, torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered, feathers flying. Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place, the mimeograph smashed. Szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. He shuffles along, comes to the cafe, goes inside. A shambles, Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, broken chairs. Stops, looks about. He turns and makes for the door. Then he hears an urgent hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it. Now he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside him. Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden from view. Thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs in the cramped space. He can't continue. Benek nods. In bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded by two German policemen. They are being marched out of the ghetto gates. Street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. Women bargain with them, making purchases. Lively, colourful. Dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously. Again Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him, doesn't see. He goes back to work. The German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit. The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread. Szpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the stall. He comes to a decision. He jumps down, is about to dash towards Janina, but stops dead. Janina is no longer there. As before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen. A little later: Szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead. A swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of exploding shells. The workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below. An SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman. Szpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly. After a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied. Two Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets.",
    "230": "A gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed. Bogucki holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself. The ceramic stove is shown. Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned. Janina shoves the strips of clothes into the stove. Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while he spoons hot soup into his mouth. Janina adds the last strip of clothing. A rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets. The rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store. The moment it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast. GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and then pulls down the shutter. Gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc. He leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from a chair and a blanket. Szpilman follows. Gebczynski leads Szpilman down the stairs. Dark, shadowy. Shelves with taps, washers, pipes. Gebczynski leads the may to a particular set of shelves. He puts aside the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves. Slowly, the shelves move to reveal a secret compartment. He helps Szpilman into the compartment. He hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that Szpilman is now hidden. In the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, seeing something. Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt. As they board. Gebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until they reach a chain and a sign. In the German section, only three or four passengers. Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles. Szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The tram rumbles on its way. Gebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door. Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in. A charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out. He can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings.",
    "233": "Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out. There are views of the city, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box. Michal comes up behind Szpilman, then makes for the door. He nods and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman takes in the room. He sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height. He opens the lid. A cloth covers the keys. He removes the cloth. He gazes lovingly at the keyboard. He flexes his fingers. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays. Passionately. Snow falling. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then the idle. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers. Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours. He gives the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses. He unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread. He takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops. He grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes. The padlock is locked on the other side. Sunshine floods in through the windows. Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. The sound of the padlock. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers. Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. She starts for the door. He leaves. The padlock sound. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles. Szpilman suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him; barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted: women, an old man with a stick.",
    "24": "Carol looks at her mother with wide eyes, apprehensive, and her mother nods permission for her to let something go. Carol gives a last defiant snort before becoming overwhelmed. She breathes heavily, gaining control and stopping herself from crying. Slumped and fought out, Carol asks one last question in a husky voice. There is a beat of silence. He hands something back to her deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area, embarrassed, confused, and messed with, where she tosses the note. After Carol leaves, Melvin looks up, wary, as his brain sends a disturbing message. Carol enters the scene, then exits. Frank prepares to depart but stumbles back, then self-satisfied, he relaxes, adjusts, and exits. She offers him the note. Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses, looking at him for a very strange, long beat. She takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of the closet, looks in another drawer, ponders, hesitates, talks to herself, and puts something back. Melvin is in his bedroom with everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed, including a camera. He has a list of what he needs, with items like underwear and socks, each with four checks next to them, and he checks each stack on the bed, adding another check. The phone rings. He makes a little comment to himself as he moves, finding this an amazing development since he has almost no recent experience with receiving a nighttime phone call. As she picks up the phone, Melvin visibly relaxes. Frank starts to leave, but Simon stops him, and they embrace. As Frank moves off, Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes. Carol puts her bag in the car, and off they go. Simon and Carol are stunned by the manners as they turn onto Fifth. The camera follows Melvin as he goes to a rack of CDs, all carefully labeled. Carol chats away, and Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority. Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma, which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out her window, then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek, a nice, understated gesture of friendship. Melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture. Carol walks to Simon, puts an arm on him, gives him a kiss, turns to him, and exits the room. Melvin is unnerved. Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite and hears the shower running. She sits down to wait.",
    "240": "He starts to scale a wall and looks as though he's getting away. But there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots. The man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked. The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly. Szpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano. The cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, the mood is sombre. A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance. The doorman lets her in. Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently. Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, threads his way through to Halina. She's shivering, almost unable to speak. Szpilman running. Streets crowded. Corpses. Szpilman, sweating, dodges and sidesteps. Then, suddenly, a woman bars his way. She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged, with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm. Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on. A mob of men in front of the building being herded this way and that by Jewish policemen. More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos). The mob constantly swelling. Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd. Szpilman scans the mob. The Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. Szpilman becomes alert. He's seen someone he recognises. Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton, driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller. Heller glances round. Heller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach, but he continues to beat and manhandle people. Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away. Szpilman stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn. Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building. Comings and goings. German Soldiers in evidence. The mob is smaller now. Szpilman waits and watches, and then a POOR WOMAN passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a RAGGED OLD MAN, dragging himself along. He's shivering with cold, his shoes with holes show his purple feet. The ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman.",
    "249": "She touches its sleeve, then her hand goes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the Zippo closed. The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line. Her head jerks back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits. Vince continues. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Slack-jawed. Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone. Jody, his wife, calls from the bedroom, obviously woken up. Lance charges from the window, out the door to his front lawn. Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. We start in Lance's and Jody's bedroom. Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a documentary in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. Lance looks up at Jody. We follow Lance as he runs out of the living room into a. With a bunch of junk in it.",
    "250": "Lance continues his frenzied search, flipping and knocking over things. Jody calls to Lance and appears in the doorway. Lance spins toward her, then angrily knocks over a pile of things and leaves the shot, heading for the living room. Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room. Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody and opens it, beginning to prepare the needle for injection. Vince rips Mia's blouse open and points to her right breast. Lance glances over and nods. As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody. Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action, then runs to the desk and opens the top drawer, pulling the drawer out and spilling its contents. The injection is ready, and Lance hands Vincent the needle. Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle with a big red magic marker. Vincent grabs the marker and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. \"Then once you do, push down on the plunger,\" Vincent says. He lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion and looks down on Mia, who is fading fast. Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this. Lance, on his knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. The red dot is on Mia's body, and the needle is raised, ready to strike. Jody's face is alive with anticipation. The needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard. Vincent brings the needle down hard, stabbing Mia in the chest. Mia's head is jolted from the impact. The syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. Mia's eyes pop wide open, and she lets out a hellish cry, bolting up in a sitting position with the needle stuck in her chest, screaming. Vincent, Lance, and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, jump back, scared to death. Mia's scream runs out, and she slowly starts taking breaths of air. The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. She turns around. Vincent is out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big distance between the two. Mia smiles. The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake, and shake they do. Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.",
    "251": "Vincent smiles and Mia giggles before Vincent turns around. We're in the living room of a modest two-bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. Butch's mother, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The camera is the perspective of a five-year-old boy. Koons steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent. The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes into frame to accept it. The 27-year-old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes, and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as we cut to him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove. His trainer Klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway. A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. We slowly dolly toward the parked car. The sound of the car radio can be heard coming from inside. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup. The sportscasters continue their coverage. Click, Esmeralda shuts off the radio. She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a noise behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see. A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves, and yellow robe, leaps to the dumpster below. Esmeralda's reaction takes in the strangeness of this sight. Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes, and gloves, hops in the backseat, slamming the door. Esmeralda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror. Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off. Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror. She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying the other one. Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore. As he tosses his other glove out the window. He finished wiping himself down. He tosses the towel out the window. Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.",
    "252": "Butch pulls on his tee-shirt. Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement. He looks at her license. We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside. Butch hangs up the phone. Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill. Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it for sometime. He gives her the bill. Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again. Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss. Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. Fabienne reacts. Fabienne lies her head back. Butch continues to massage her crotch. Butch kisses her on the mouth. Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame. She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head. She hands him a towel. Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth. Butch keeps on talking from the other room. Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remembers something. She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. She looks at him for a moment. Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. Fabienne enters the room. Fabienne laughs. Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss. Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought. Butch is finished dressing. As he goes through the suitcase. By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase. He's now throwing clothes. Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way. Fabienne is crying and scared. Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing. He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. Then rises. Fabienne is still sniffling. Butch goes to the closet. Butch puts on his high school jacket. Rising from the floor. The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.",
    "255": "A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen. The hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers. As his picture is taken, it is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it. Hi obliges, but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye, focusing on his eye-skewed profile. As Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell, at the far end of the corridor a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor. The Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes. Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs, the pan starts on Hi. At this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back. He is addressing one of the Cons, a huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head who is knitting his brow in consternation. Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across a table. A beat-up Chevy pulls into the all-night store's empty parking lot. Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding a pump-action shotgun. He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the store. Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot wall. Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera. On Hi's profile, he turns back to Ed. Looking up through her tears as Hi is led away. As another police officer starts to lead him away, struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door. The door slams. As Hi is once again escorted toward his cell, the Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him. As Hi passes, Hi looks sheepish. Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, appear to be friends. Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling. Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. He spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the back door. Locked. As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. On Hi against the mug-shot wall, we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet.",
    "258": "At the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7-Eleven with his gun. The two bang away at Hi's retreating figure - the Policeman's revolver popping, the Cashier's Magnum booming. Huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies, Hi hears the cop car careen onto the street in the background, its siren wailing. The PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window, one hand gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun at Hi, shooting away. Bullets whizz past. Suddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward, out from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet. Still running, Hi reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, tips it - loses it. He overruns it a couple steps before he can bring himself up short. He turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING - bullets chew up the road near his hand. Leaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured yard. The police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him around the corner, the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker. We are tracking behind Hi as he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door. Still tracking behind him as he runs through the living room. A middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV. They look up as Hi rushes by. Hi plunges down a staircase. As he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock. He emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping-pong. He runs out the back door. OFFICER STEENSMA plunges down the stairs. Outdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side. As a pack of dogs thunders in. The lead Doberman with chain and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs. The dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs. As Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something. He turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run. He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires. Hi keeps running. The Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace with Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the Policeman.",
    "259": "He runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store. The pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap. Hi reverses again and emerges into the back aisle. BANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. Hi looks. Standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the store is the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. The Manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more cartridges - THOONK THOONK - in the smoking chamber. Hi doubles back once again toward the back aisle. The MANAGER is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind him. As he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at Hi. Still on the dead run, Hi is flinging the carton of Huggies. The carton rockets straight at the camera. Futilely raising his gun to avoid impact: The Huggies catch him square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one fatal step backwards - into the back aisle - where: CRASH - He is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart, propelled by a hysterically screaming SHOPPER. Racing on down the back aisle, bellowing. Tracking from in front. Beyond her we can see the pack of furiously barking dogs, nipping at her heels. As Hi emerges through the back door. Ed is just skidding around the corner. Hi scrambles in the passenger side. The car peels out of the lot. THWAK - Ed gives him a good hard slap and Hi's head rolls toward the camera. Hi's eyes are fixed on something in the road ahead. Hi's attention is still on the road. He is opening his door, even though the car is still racing along. He absently concedes. In the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies that Hi dropped in the middle of the road. The car is approaching. As the car passes the carton, Hi's hand reaches from the passenger door and snags it. As Hi pulls the carton in and slams his door shut. Crane up in the car speeding away. As Ed bursts in the front door, holding Nathan Jr. They look up, dumbstruck and mortified, from the sofa where they have been watching TV. Ed is unmoved. She storms into the bedroom and slams the door. There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi. His gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation.",
    "261": "Nathan Arizona's name is backward on the pebbled glass of an office door. A man's shadow approaches the door with muffled voices from inside. The door swings open, revealing Nathan staring towards his desk, where a Biker sits with his back to the door, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. The Biker's head bobs and ducks, following some movement in the air. Nathan slams the door, but the Biker doesn't react, continuing to track some phantom movement. He speaks softly and unhurriedly, taking a drag on his cigar which he had lit by striking a long wooden match on an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar and causing the match to erupt into roaring flame, crackling. The Biker, Smalls, suddenly bolts forward, stopping his fist an inch short of Nathan's nose, holding a struggling fly he had plucked from the air, then flicking it away. Nathan stares grimly at Smalls, swivels to punch numbers on a telephone, and swivels back to find the office empty. Meanwhile, Hi looks up from being slumped over a kitchen table, asleep, to find Gale and Evelle smiling down at him. He takes an envelope addressed to Ed. A harsh knock at the door tenses all three. Hi looks evenly at the door, then nervously peeks out. He steps down, holding out a calming hand, but Glen takes two nervous steps away, reassuring himself by resting a hand on his station wagon. Hi stops short as Glen smiles, spits on the dirt, and gets into his car, slamming the door and squealing off. Hi looks back at the trailer as a slat in the window blind drops back into place. He opens the door as Evelle emerges from the bedroom with a baby in his arms.",
    "263": "The rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped off by a click. The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands in the doorway. The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet. The room is a complete shambles from the fight. Sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light. After only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of paper. He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a soft grunt of surprise. As he stands up with the piece of paper, it is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank. Baking in the noonday sun, sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at the bank, they look at each other. Gale reaches for his door. As Gale and Evelle bang in through the door, Evelle holds a shotgun; Gale holds a shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. in his car seat in the other. Everyone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An Old Hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up. There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. Gale is tossing Evelle a sack. He is looking in shock at the tellers' counter. A muffled voice from offscreen. Evelle is momentarily abashed, but then brightens. Gale registers understanding. There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs. The car is approaching the townlet, its siren wailing. A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags. Close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device. The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking; she shoves it into the sack. He is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who also picks up the baby. As the two are backing toward the door, they bolt out the door. Siren jumps in loud at the cut. It is the same locked-down shot over the gumballs. Peeling out from in front of the bank, Gale is driving; Evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks. A thought registers with Gale and Evelle at the same moment. They look at each other. They both twist frantically to look in the back seat. Bellowing. KA-POP! With a loud flat crack something detonates in the front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint.",
    "265": "Hi and Ed raise their heads, unaware that Lenny is approaching again through the rear window. Lenny saws out his second shotgun. Hi looks around, pulls Ed down beneath him just as the second shotgun blasts and the back window shatters. As Lenny passes the back window, he casually flips something in. Folded over in the front seat, they don't notice Lenny's grenade bounce into the leg well. The two front doors fly open and Hi and Ed spill out—Hi from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road, and Ed from the passenger side, diving for cover behind a parked car. Their car explodes, pouring black smoke. The explosion flings Hi to the ground in the middle of the street. Looking up the street, he sees Lenny wheeling his bike in a U-turn; he is not finished yet. Hi, flat on his back, weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street at his legs stretched away in a V. Lenny's roaring bike, crashing down from a wheelie, is almost upon him, aiming up the middle of the V. Hi rolls as the bike roars by and snags a chain on Lenny's passing boot. Dragged several yards, the boot shakes him off, leaving him on his stomach in the middle of the road. Hi looks up the road as Lenny slues the bike around, smoking as it skids, completing its turn. Lenny's back reveals Ed stomping straight up the street toward him, unarmed and unafraid. As Ed closes in, Lenny's arms rise into frame, and with a roll of his wrists, two knives appear in his hands. On his stomach, sighting down the gun toward Lenny, Hi sees Ed stepping into his line of fire, blocking Lenny. Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat, revealing Hi behind her. He fires, and Lenny, drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife. The exit wound spurts a brief jet of fire. Lenny quickly hurled the other knife at Hi, stinging the gun out of his hand, and bends to scoop up the knife he dropped. Ed runs toward the bank, clutching Nathan Jr. to her chest. As Ed bursts in, the floor is littered with obedient hayseeds. From where he lies prone, Hi hears the front door burst open before Lenny's roaring hog. It sails off a step into the sunken atrium and lands with a crash amidst the hayseeds.",
    "267": "She runs for the back door and pushes through it. He slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds. Lenny bursts out. With a whipcrack effect, he looks left, then right. He jerks the bike right, to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank. Ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as Lenny enters. He roars after her. Roaring down the alley, the bike approaches behind her, closing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley. A plank swings into frame, straight at the camera. Matching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lenny's face. Lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him, riderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses. Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods encouragement to Ed. Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife. Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as the knife is thrown. It thunks into the plank, piercing it through. Hi backs up, swinging the knife-studded plank to make Lenny keep his distance. As he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder. As the free chain drops down into his palm. Swinging the chain - WHOOSH WHOOSH - at the backpedaling Hi. As the chain snakes around it and rips it out of Hi's hands. Grabbing Hi by the shirtfront, swings down and brass knuckles appear on it. As Lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. An uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back. As Hi lands against it, banging his head. He sinks to the ground. Lenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot. Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car. Hi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape. Behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib. Lenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car. Struggling to stand up. Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug. Crushed against Lenny. His hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest. Lenny finally flings Hi away. Landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him. Tired of the fight: He saws out both shotguns. On the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back. He raises the guns to fire. The end of the road. He wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him - then stops, staring at.",
    "268": "A hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of Hi's fingers. Pawing at Lenny's chest, he must have hooked his finger through its ring. Reacting, Hi looks down. On the bandoliers across his chest, silver pins glint in all the grenades - except one. Its squeeze-lever juts at a right angle from the grenade. Hi's jaw drops. The lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots. Scrambling to his feet, Hi tries to drop the shotguns to free his hands. In his panic, his fingers tangle in the trigger guards. Starting to run, he finally frees his hands. Diving behind the parked car, his hands fly in to wrap around the grenade - too late - bright light. He blows sky-high. There is a roar as if the earth were cracking open and flame as if hell were slipping out. We pan the fire to the sky. A white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness, clanking softly. The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera. It is late at night; the nursery is dark and empty. Of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr. As we pull back from the headboard, Ed's arms are gently depositing the sleeping Nathan Jr. into the crib. Hi puts the singed copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care next to the baby. Hi and Ed look sadly down at the baby. The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as the lights are snapped on. Hi and Ed turn, startled. Nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun and squinting against the light. Keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed, he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose. He advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his gun. Hi and Ed back away from the crib. Nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment. He lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds him to his chest. A tear forms at the corner of his eye. Hi and Ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder. As he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed, Hi shrugs. Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib. He turns around with a thought. Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. She stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs something to comfort her. Nathan is studying the two of them. Hi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush. Nathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs.",
    "27": "At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a torrid sky. The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter. The narrator's voice fade away. A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads. An officer BLOWS his whistle several times. There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people. A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams through the street and stops in the market. Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon. At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and question him. The civilian pats his pockets. He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them. Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street. JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world. A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds Free French literature. A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely than the scene on the street. A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de Justice. The European walks over to the couple. The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out. Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the Palais de Justice. At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the police. He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman, and reaches behind the man with his right hand. The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern. As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing. The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at the edge of the airport. As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard. In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.",
    "270": "A squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground. Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt, while Ed is in her dress blues. The agent looks from the file to Hi with a deadpan expression, then looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple feet long. Ed stares vacantly out the passenger window as they are driving. Hi looks from Ed out to the road. Hi stares listlessly at himself in the mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half lathered and half shaved. The bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the bed, also staring listlessly, her police uniform on but not yet buttoned, her hands lying palm-up in her lap. Hi works as his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands idly by. Alone in his Chevy, Hi looks to the side, seeing a 7-Eleven. Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV. Ed perks up, reacting to something on TV. Hi notices her reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch. A newscaster is silently reading copy, behind him news footage of five nurses holding infants. Watching intently, Ed reaches her hand out to Hi. Eyes still locked on the set, Hi takes her hand in his. Nathan Arizona, a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester suit, is gesturing expansively with his white cowboy hat toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium parking lot. A businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine door as he turns to leave. Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five-finger discount copy. He flips the paper over to look at the headline: Arizona Quints Go Home. Hi and Ed read it together at home. They look from the paper to each other. In the middle of the desert, Ed is seated, waiting, in the driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters the frame and cinches down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car, pieces of red flag fluttering at either end of the ladder where it sticks out beyond the car. Hi gets in the car. It starts down the long, winding road leading away from the trailer, kicking up dust. Nathan Arizona is on the telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman.",
    "271": "Florence sits reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care in a living room dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan and herself over the mantelpiece. An infant starts to cry upstairs, causing Florence to look up at the ceiling, but Nathan is oblivious. The baby stops crying and Florence returns to her book. Nathan checks his watch, revealing the time to be 8:45 p.m. He starts to replace the phone receiver but brings it back briefly before slamming it into the cradle. Another baby starts crying, and Florence looks up at the ceiling again. Hi is seen bouncing the crying baby gently but desperately. They sound restless. A baby crawls toward the camera in the foreground, while another baby is seen rounding the open door from the nursery in the background. Hi emerges from the nursery, stepping around the background baby, and trots toward the baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it, only his feet, calves, and the baby are visible, with the stairway down to the main floor in the background. Hi scoops up the baby and tiptoes toward the nursery. As Hi reaches the baby at the nursery door, footsteps are heard climbing the stairs. Hi's free arm scoops up the baby just as Florence's head appears, climbing the stairs with the Dr. Spock book. She approaches the nursery and enters, freezing halfway to the crib in shock. Meanwhile, Ed sees Hi approaching the car, shrugging with empty hands. Hi tries to open the driver's door, but Ed slaps his hand away, holding the door shut and rolling up the window, locking it. Muffled through the closed window, Hi looks forlorn. Florence is seen holding one of the babies against her shoulder, the baby facing the window. Hi appears at the window, holding a finger to his lips. Florence starts bouncing the baby, patting it on the back, with Hi and the window bouncing up and down.",
    "274": "A Biker approaches, craning down as he draws near. With the crane down, he momentarily disappears from view over the rise, then suddenly—ROAR—he tops the rise and, wheels spinning, becomes airborne. He crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away. Now, we are no longer in the desert but looking down a twilight street at the end of which is the Arizona house. The roar of the Biker's engine and the clank of his chains recede as he gradually dissolves into thin air. We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house. The receding roar leaves behind eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby. Faintly, behind the singing, there is also a droning high-pitched noise. The camera starts floating forward very close to the ground, moving slowly toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched drone becomes less faint under the singing. The camera accelerates. The drone grows louder, revealing it is a human scream. As we approach the Arizona house, we see a ladder propped up to a second-story window. We are moving quite fast now. The scream almost buries the singing. We rush toward the house, toward the base of the ladder, the sustained scream drawing us on. We hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no abatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream. We reach the top and hurtle—THWAP!—through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to reveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the crib. We are rocketing toward her. She turns to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek, and we rush into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis as they snap open. The screaming snaps off at the cut. The singing that the building scream covered is now audible again. Perspiration beads Hi's forehead. It is now morning. Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby as she walks. She is singing it a lullaby. Hi is getting out of bed. The orange sun, rumbling, perceptibly rises. At the cut, the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high-pitched ba-WEEEEeeee of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken. We are looking over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of press people who stand out on the porch. An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in at us; various flashbulbs pop.",
    "275": "A policeman inside the house takes Nathan by the elbow, leading him back into the house as Nathan calls back over his shoulder. We follow the two, hand-held, as the police lead Nathan toward the living room filled with policemen in various uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes detectives. The original policeman leads Nathan to a table where a white-smocked technician is preparing an inkpad and exemplar sheets. The dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire, and overlapping. Byrum takes Nathan's right hand and rolls its fingers onto the inkpad. Nathan jerks his hand away but then gives it back, raising his voice at an offscreen bellower. Nathan gets worked up, grabs the overcoat displayed by FBI #2, and realizes he's gotten ink on it. He furiously kicks the coat and stalks the room, working himself into a frenzy, putting coffee cups onto coasters, cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping their feet off his furniture. Meanwhile, a hole in a muddy patch of earth that Gale and Evelle climbed out of is surrounded by policemen in shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs, quickly becoming spattered, and German shepherds sniffing around. With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter the frame. The bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back and dogs skitter away to give him room. He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike. The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up, and the Biker shakes his head, not thinking they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head snaps to profile, staring across the field, having heard, smelled, or sensed something. The dogs also react, snapping to attention a split second after the Biker. A jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field. After a moment, their attention returns to the hole, and the Biker's attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints, concentrating, as his bike rumbles. The bathroom where Gale and Evelle combed their hair is now empty and quiet except for the dripping sink and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle. It grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. Suddenly, we hear the screech of the bike's brakes. We are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground.",
    "28": "Laszlo turns off the light and sits down on the couch next to her. It grows strained and a silence falls between them. Ilsa still cannot look at him, but eventually, she turns to look at Laszlo. He bends down and kisses her cheek, then kisses her on the cheek again and goes out the door. She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window. She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. The figure in the archway is gone. Ilsa gets a cloak from the bedroom and leaves the hotel room. Meanwhile, Carl is busy figuring as Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl looks up at Rick and laughs. Ilsa comes over to meet Rick. He walks over to the window and Ilsa follows. Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box but finds it empty. There are tears in her eyes now. He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa. He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand. It's pointed directly at him. He moves closer to her. Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again. She turns and walks away from him. Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. She is lost in his embrace. He presses her tight to him. Rick kisses her passionately. From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at the airport. Ilsa sits on the couch with a bottle of champagne and two half-filled glasses on a table before her. Rick walks over to her and sits down with Ilsa. Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder and snuggles closer to Rick. They run inside the entryway as the headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them. The lights move past them, and they flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection. Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a side entrance of Rick's. Laszlo and Carl enter and cross toward the bar, out of breath from their exertion. Carl goes behind the bar. Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door and opens it just enough to see below, then turns off the light. Ilsa stands just in back of him. She makes a move as if to go out to the balcony but Rick pushes her back. She withdraws behind the door. Rick walks out to the balcony railing. Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured. Both Carl and Laszlo look up. Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway. Carl climbs the stairs and enters Rick's apartment, where he sees Ilsa.",
    "280": "Jeff listens to something, then plays it again. He decides it is no good and returns to his carpet sweeping. The camera pans left to the salesman's apartment, where the living room and kitchen are lighted, but the bedroom is dark. It continues to pan left to a couple sleeping on the fire escape. The man is laying out the mattress. His wife, slightly younger and a faded showgirl type with peroxided hair, is leaning over the railing in pajamas, holding a rope leading to a dog's basket. She calls to the dog melodically. The man is middle-aged, balding, and also wearing striped pajamas. The dog emerges from the shadows and gets into the basket, which begins to move upward. The camera follows it, then pans to Miss Torso's apartment. She is brushing her hair in the bathroom, lost in thought. The camera drops down to an elderly lady with a hearing aid, working on abstract sculpture. She wears a short smock with bare legs, carving a hole through a piece of mahogany. The camera moves left to the newly-weds' apartment with the shade drawn, then passes through Jeff's window, resting on Jeff and Lisa. Lisa's lips brush Jeff's cheek as she speaks, seated on his knee with her arms around his neck. She starts kissing him, but gives up and moves back. Lisa stands, straightens her dress, stretches, and turns to the divan, disturbed as she watches Jeff. Jeff's apartment is in darkness, faintly lit from neighbors' windows. He is thoughtful, then relaxes and smiles. Lisa stretches out on the divan.",
    "281": "Her head rests on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. She is reading a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another. Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window. Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. Jeff looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. Jeff is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. At that moment the songwriter returns to his composing. Although it is not complete, it is farther along than before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hear Lisa's voice. Jeff puts out a restraining hand. At last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. Slung over one shoulder, with his arm through it, is a large coil of sturdy rope. He goes through the living room into the bedroom. Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, and trains them on the salesman's apartment. Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan, moves over to Jeff. In a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window. He drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise. Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair. Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move. She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment. A dim light burning behind them. The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment. Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle. She is still staring out the window, as the scene. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. Jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street.",
    "284": "She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house and, by her attitude, we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. Stella is seen looking up toward Jeff's apartment, arms outspread in a helpless gesture. Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. He lowers the glasses and turns to Jeff. Shooting towards the big window with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, now turned toward a newcomer. The second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He has a sense of humor and is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. Doyle paces a little, then goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat. He pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. Doyle, still at the door, starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window. Miss Torso, in ballet costume, is practicing her dance on the outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable. Doyle even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle enjoying Miss Torso. Jeff notices Doyle's interest. Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance. Jeff's face grows serious. Doyle quickly collects his thoughts and gets back to the case at hand. The camera moves back as Doyle returns to his drink. He moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat, and pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him intently. Doyle looks at Jeff with some smugness. He puts on his hat and goes toward the door. The camera is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich sits. Jeff's hand comes in and picks it up. We pan with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is sober. Except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness. As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. The camera pans slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. Thorwald's apartment is in darkness. The sun has just set. We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view. She seems to be putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going out.",
    "288": "The brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. With his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well-muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. The man enters the bedroom. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. He hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. Jeff shifts his look more to the right. Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. It gives no relief. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation.",
    "289": "She gets up from Jeff's lap and puts the overnight case on the table. She goes to the window and looks toward the songwriters' apartment. The party at the songwriter's has grown considerably larger. An assortment of well-dressed people have now crowded into the studio. They are drinking, eating, etc. Lisa stands, listening, entranced. Jeff watches her. She sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff. She leans toward him. Jeff's tension eases off a little, but he is eager to talk. Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She continues rotating the brandy. She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. Doyle reacts to her appreciatively. She offers the second to Doyle. Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly. Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. Lisa smiles in return. She turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen. Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the first sight of her attractiveness. Then quickly, his eyes move down and to the left. The open overnight case with its displayed lingerie. Slowly Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff. Quickly guessing what's on Doyle's mind, Jeff picks up the phone. He turns his head to Lisa, who answers. Doyle looks suddenly interested. He asks tersely. His head snaps back to Jeff, who answers. His head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice. Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently. Doyle smiles at Jeff, and then strolls over to the table where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter. Doyle goes to the window and looks out, as they watch him, expectantly. His voice is flat and to the point. He speaks without looking at them. Jeff and Lisa stare at him in astonishment. Then Jeff recovers, and answers with some anger. He starts to pace the room. He spins around, and his face has lost all its friendliness. She replies with some sarcasm. Lisa and Jeff. Jeff, reasoning. Lisa cuts in spiritedly. Doyle starts to pace up and down, throwing out a hand in careful explanation. Jeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. Doyle has turned away into the center of the room. He swings around. Lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm. Doyle comes toward the camera again.",
    "29": "He looks at Rick and says nothing. Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink. Laszlo takes a drink. Rick reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it, and takes out a cigarette. Rick lights his cigarette. He looks away for a moment. Suddenly there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed by the forced entry of several gendarmes. A French officer walks in and addresses Laszlo. Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence crosses to the officer. Together they walk toward the door. Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing of his feelings. They're interrupted by an orderly. Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits, and the conversation continues. Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously fingers his hat. Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of his desk. Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk. Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one. Renault sits back down in his chair. Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault. Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER. The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go. A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a table in a secluded nook off the main room. Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip. Rick gets up, followed by Ferrari. They shake hands to seal the deal. He walks to the door, then stops and turns around. Rick leaves. Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table and swats at a fly. A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe. On the door a huge placard reads. Renault looks around the empty cafe. Rick points at his breast pocket. They hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pull up. Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office. Ilsa quickly walks toward the entrance. Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment. Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself. Renault opens the office door and peers down at the proceedings. They all walk towards the bar. Laszlo deposits his hat on a a nearby table. He takes out the letters. He hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully. All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking towards them from the bottom of the stairs. Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes. Renault takes the letters. They turn towards Rick, bewildered. Obviously the situation delights Renault.",
    "298": "Stella takes a handful of oil and slaps it on Jeff's back. He winces. She hits him with more cold oil. He winces again. Jeff gives an exasperated look. The camera pulls back as Stella helps Jeff to a sitting position. He buttons his shirt. The camera moves in as Stella helps Jeff into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. Jeff stops and notices her attitude. He looks out to see what has happened to the old lady and the man with the flowers. The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window. Dreamily and methodically, she is brushing her long copper-colored hair while sitting near the window, looking into an upright mirror. Jeff's eyes suddenly turn sharply to his left. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker, is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room and approaches a young man and woman standing just inside the doorway. The caretaker hands a key to the young man and brings in two suitcases, placing them on the floor beside the couple. He gives them a studied but agreeable nod and departs. The girl has a small hat with a veil and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, like the girl, is perhaps twenty years old and wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. Then slowly and significantly, she looks toward the open window. They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. He releases her hands, goes to the window, and pulls down the shade as she reaches upward with both hands to unpin her hat. There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. The camera makes a short sweep around the neighborhood, showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.",
    "299": "The camera pulls back into Jeff's apartment until his head fills the screen. He is asleep. A shadow of someone else creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up. The screen is filled with the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman coming nearer to the camera to kiss Jeff. The face is more or less in shadow, a faint light coming onto the profile from the window. The girl kisses Jeff firmly, but not passionately. Then her head moves back an inch or two. She speaks. The two big profiles fill the screen. It moves down until the lips move out of her bottom of her screen, and just the remain for fill the screen. The camera follows her quickly to another lamp. She gets a little farther away from us so that we now see her down to her waist. She turns on the second lamp and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face. The camera pans her over to a third lamp which she turns on. She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless. Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear. Jeff looks across the room at her. She does a professional model's turn in the dress showing off its features. Jeff replies. She laughs pleasantly. She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which is littered with a number of his personal effects. Her own handbag is also on the table. As she talks her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific. Lisa finds what she has been looking for. Picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, examines it as she talks. She turns to look at him, and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box. Lisa facing Jeff in the chair. She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, the camera panning with her. She goes up the two steps, stops, turns back to Jeff. She reaches for the doorknob, turns it. She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. His reaction is one of tender amusement. He smiles, nods enters. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. He goes down the stairs, as she follows. He hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table. The camera goes with both of them. He moves toward the kitchen. She moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet.",
    "3": "The Colonel grabs him by the collar, then glances toward the window. In the window across from them, Jane peeks out from behind the drape, then quickly pulls it shut. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed. He stands, still breathing heavily, then leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau, looking at his reflection in the mirror. He calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. Meanwhile, Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, firing it directly at us. She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition, and she starts firing again. Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is. The scene shifts to an ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs. The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail, then into the Burnham driveway. A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks access to the garage. Inside, the room seems changed: sloppier, more lived in. Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car. His REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. She just stands there, staring at Lester. His working out is beginning to produce results, and he smiles at her playfully. It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just laughs. His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him. He smiles and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet, she's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His smile fades, and the moment is gone. He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room. Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry. Meanwhile, Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top. She glances at us. We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room. A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the camera, standing naked. He's aiming his camera at Jane. She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes. Jane zooms in on his face, which remains placid. Ricky smiles, then grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.",
    "30": "He smiles as he turns toward Rick. Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at Renault. Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick. He walks to a table and sits. As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the letters. Strasser is on the phone. He hangs up the receiver and presses a buzzer on his desk. An officer quickly enters. He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly exits. The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline of the transport plane is barely visible. On the airfield a transport plane is being readied. A uniformed orderly uses a telephone near the hangar door. He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar. Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention. He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun. Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car. Laszlo and take care of his luggage. The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane. Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar. Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment. Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa. Renault countersigns the papers. Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her chin and raises her face to meet his own. Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport. He honks his horn furiously. Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo. Rick hands the letters to Laszlo. Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly. On the airfield the airplane engine turns over and the propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off. Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa. Then Laszlo breaks the silence. Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane. Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth. The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field. Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar. Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault. Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway. Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door. His eyes dart towards the telephone.",
    "301": "Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob. Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. He is unaware that Lisa is standing behind him, and is also watching this little drama. In the background, Lisa, having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning to the kitchen. Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left. The kitchen-lining room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable. The ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the surroundings. Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and with an added personal touch for each guest. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. She is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning. Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and makes him rejoin the other two. She moves away with a significant look to him. He ponders over her last remark, then changes his look to another direction. THE CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.",
    "303": "Lisa slowly helps Jeff to lobster from the main dish. Shooting over Jeff's shoulder, we see the divan-bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face, but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. There is one light burning behind Lisa's head. Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table. Two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table. A fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body, and legs. Jeff raises both his hands. Lisa draws back one leg and points a finger challengingly. Lisa, stretched out on the divan, sees Jeff getting angry. Jeff is definitely angry. She looks at him for a moment without speaking. After a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly, then says something as if remembering some old experience. Shooting over Lisa's shoulder and down her body, with Jeff in the chair beyond, Lisa turns on her side and stares into the room angrily. Lisa realizes she is getting nowhere. We see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture. Lisa, still looking out into the room and without turning, says something. She turns at last and looks across at him. Lisa starts to rise from the divan, the camera panning up. Jeff looks across at her with some concern. She moves away from the camera into the center of the room as she says something. Lisa begins to move around the room assembling her possessions preparatory to leaving. From Jeff's viewpoint, he begins to get desperate. Lisa pauses in the act of gathering her things together. She gets her stole. Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it and remains silent. Lisa turns in the half-opened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand. Lisa, standing in the open doorway, continues smiling as she closes the door softly behind her. The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. A low camera has Jeff's head in the foreground, with Stella just behind him, at work on his back. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously. She stops massaging, reaches for the oil, and hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes his breath. She helps him to a sitting position. Jeff turns his head away for a moment. She hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. She helps him into the chair. The back of his chair is to the window.",
    "304": "The fellas crack up and all mutter equivalents. Joe stands up. Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Everybody whips out a buck and throws it on the table, except Mr. Pink. Everybody laughs. They all laugh. They all laugh again. Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together. They all laugh once more. Joe comes back to the table. Mr. Orange is screaming; he lies in the backseat, having been shot in the stomach. Blood covers both him and the backseat. Mr. White is behind the wheel of the getaway car, driving for his life, and keeps talking to his wounded passenger, Mr. Orange. They are the only two in the car. Then the door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of Mr. Orange inside. Mr. Orange is still moaning loudly from his bullet hit. Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend. Mr. White gets Mr. Orange in a headlock. Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog. Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody. Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. The two men end up on the floor kicking and scratching. The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner with a bathroom at the end of the hall. Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view. Mr. White turns to leave. Guns are firing, people are shouting and screaming, sirens are wailing. Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked. The Shocked Woman starts screaming. Mr. Pink exits the frame, leaving Mr. White alone. The men share a laugh. We follow behind Mr. Pink up to Mr. White, who's standing over Mr. Orange. As Mr. Pink gets closer, he sees Mr. Orange is out. Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table. Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun and pulls it out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and goes for his own weapon. The two men are with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another. Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime. Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. Blonde. Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away. Mr. Blonde stops moving and heads for the door. The other two men just follow him with their eyes. Mr. Blonde walks out. He is walking towards the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind. In the background, we see what looks like an office set up.",
    "31": "Major Strasser, accompanied by Herr Heinze, the German consul, Captain Tonelli, an Italian officer, and Lieutenant Casselle, Renault's aide, steps onto the scene. Whenever crossed, Strasser's expression turns stern. Heinze approaches him with an upraised arm, and they shake hands. Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault, a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, who salutes. Renault is debonair and gay but also a shrewd and alert official. As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli steps in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser, but Strasser turns back to Renault. They walk away from the plane, with Heinze following, and Casselle and Tonelli trailing behind, engaged in a heated exchange. A neon sign above a door is brightly lit as customers arrive and enter. We follow a group inside Rick's, an expensive and chic nightclub with an air of sophistication and intrigue. The room is filled with a variety of people: Europeans in dinner jackets with beautifully begowned and bejeweled women, Moroccans in silk robes, Turks wearing fezzes, and members of the Foreign Legion distinguished by their kepis. Sam, a middle-aged Negro, plays and sings at a small, salmon-colored piano accompanied by a small orchestra. Two men sit at a table, one seemingly uninterested in the other's dilemma, sympathy evidently in short supply. At another table, a well-dressed woman talks to a Moor, a bracelet on her wrist. Two conspirators at another table stop talking as two German officers walk by. A refugee and another man converse nearby. Approaching the bar, a Babel of foreign tongues can be heard. Carl, the waiter, a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles, carries a tray to a private door guarded by Abdul, a large, burly man. Abdul opens the door, and Carl enters the gambling room, where much activity occurs at various tables. At one table, two women and a man play cards; one calls to Carl, who laughs. An overseer walks up to a table with a paper, places a check on the table, and then takes it. Rick, an American of indeterminate age, sits alone playing solitary chess. There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to enter the gambling room.",
    "312": "Evan, after getting no answer from Lenny who stands unmoving, spins to face her. He grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, stands up, and turns in his exam, flashing a confident smile. Opening a window, he checks his Psych project: a small maze with flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other. Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms. At a bar, plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables while Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. Heidi, beautiful and wearing ripped jeans with no makeup, is among the crowd. Thumper seems oblivious to taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side, and another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Though his hand clenches on the cue, he meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks. Later, Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through a door and fall on a bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned, and Heidi strokes his chest until she suddenly stops and sniffs the air. Evan, drunkenly, crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge, and Heidi takes one, then looks under the bed. Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading, and as he reads, the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate around him like a tuning fork. Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings. Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings a plank, hitting Evan's head and sending him sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely. Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots, leaving Evan writhe in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves toward a gunny sack, lifts it, and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside. Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile. Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot, and holds on. Lenny remains frozen in place as Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip, then smiles viciously at Lenny, who watches traumatized as Tommy picks up lighter fluid and sprays a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack. Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded. Evan drives and, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Lenny, now 20, is making a model airplane in a room filled with them. Mrs. Kagan, grayer and fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside. Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw dropping, and continues working on the model in his own world. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk but, startled, drops the model on the desk.",
    "313": "Evan is terrified. Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation. Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. Mrs. Halpern, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car. When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before. Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach. Andrea shakes her head. Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface. Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern. Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away. Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently. His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat. Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. Her boss stares back in aggravation. Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a customer pinches her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably. Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged. Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes. Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question. Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette. Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow. Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan. She turns and runs away. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly. Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. Evan puts a towel under the door.",
    "318": "Flickering firelight illuminates the Noldorin Forge in Eregion, where molten gold pours from an iron ladle. Three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the High Elves—Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Cirdan. Seven rings are held aloft in triumph by the Dwarf Lords, while nine rings are clutched tightly by the Kings of Men, as if holding close a precious secret. An ancient parchment map of Middle Earth moves slowly across the map, drawn by an unseen force, and the camera closes in on the place name: Mordor. Sauron is seen forging the One Ring in the chambers, with the One Ring reflecting fiery lava and fire writing emerging on the plain band of gold. The One Ring falls through space and into flames. A great shadow falls across the map, and armies of hideous orcs pursue the people of Gondor from their homes. Isildur, son of the King of Gondor, leads an army across the Plains of Dagorlad, commanding rank after rank of Elven archers. Orcs retreat before the army of the Last Alliance, and Elendil holds aloft the great sword, Narsil. The huge, dark figure of Sauron, bearing the One Ring on his finger, looms over the field of battle and lays waste to the armies of the Last Alliance. With desperate courage, Elendil leads a charge, but the black mace of Sauron lashes out, and Elendil's body falls like a crumpled rag doll. Isildur cradles the body of his father in his arms as the shadow of Sauron falls over him. Isildur snatches up the broken blade of Narsil, and the blade severs Sauron's fingers, causing the One Ring to fly from his body and vanish. Isildur picks up the severed finger and removes the One Ring, transfixed. At Gladden Field, Isildur leads a small column of men through darkening woods, the One Ring glinting on a chain around his neck. Suddenly, arrows fly, and they are ambushed by orcs. Isildur materializes under water as the ring slips slowly from his finger. Ripples of light play across Isildur's pale face; he is dead. The ring falls through the murky waters of the river, and the waters of the Anduin River lie dark and undisturbed. Silt swirls as a thin white hand reaches down, grasping the ring. The thin white hand opens to reveal the One Ring. Bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still in the unsettled quiet before the storm. In the gloom of a mountain cavern, a murky pool of water sits in the darkness, and the shadowy outline of an emaciated figure is present, unseen by its keeper. The ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel. Fumbling in the dark, a small hand closes over the ring. A youngish-looking Bilbo Baggins peers down at what lies in his hand, perplexed by what he has found. Frightened, Bilbo quickly pockets the One Ring and hurries on.",
    "321": "The hum of the ring grows louder in Frodo's ears. Gimli suddenly stands, excited, then rushes forward, swinging his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack, and Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring, unharmed. Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him, slumping in his chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him with concern. There is stunned silence as the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice. Gimli leaps to his feet amidst motion, angry faces, shaking fists, and accusatory fingers. The hum grows louder in Frodo's head. The ring fills the screen, streams of blood flow across its surface, and flames flicker within the gold band. Frodo, breathing rapidly, is caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort of will, Frodo tears his gaze from the ring and suddenly stands, speaking in a strong, clear voice. Sudden silence follows as Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. Boromir looks at them all, then walks towards Frodo, looking towards Elrond and Gandalf. Frodo stares in wonder as the greatest fighters in all Middle Earth stand at his side. Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush. An old sword slides out of a shabby leather scabbard, its polished, well-tended blade glitters cold and bright. Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo and unwraps a small shirt of close-woven mail. Frodo peels off his shirt, revealing the ring on the chain around his neck. Suddenly, a shadow passes across Bilbo, and for a split second, he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony, groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked, as the shadow passes. Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands, faltering as his eyes fill with tears. He sobs, and Frodo moves to comfort him. The Fellowship climbs the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell, trekking through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters, with the misty mountains rising sharply to their left. Sam is at the campfire. Gimli has managed to corner Gandalf. Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground. Much laughter ensues. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others gesturing towards a high mountain pass. The Fellowship clambers through rock and snow. Frodo slips on some shale, and as he scrambles to his feet, the ring falls on the ground. The ring gleams in the snow as Boromir's hand picks it up by the chain, standing with the ring dangling before his eyes.",
    "322": "The Fellowship struggles through a blinding blizzard, up towards the Pass of Caradhras, with Legolas the Elf moving lightly across the top of the snow, suddenly pausing. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin are shivering in Boromir's arms. Later, the Fellowship is walking along the far shore of a dark lake, directly below great looming cliffs, the footing treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees, and slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. A large moon rises over the mountains, and the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. Gandalf raises his arms and eyebrows, and the rock face silently divides in the middle, two great doors swinging outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enters the blackness, something in the water stirs. They step warily into the darkness of Moria, a dank cavern with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. A glow from Gandalf's staff suddenly lights the chamber, revealing many dwarf skeletons strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle, their rusting armor and shields peppered with arrows and axes. The Fellowship draws swords and backs away towards the entrance, but Frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground, a long sinuous tentacle wrapped around his ankle, dragging him towards the lake. Frodo cries out as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward. Aragorn severs the tentacle holding Frodo and pulls him to safety, while Boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. Twenty more tentacles ripple out of the lake, the dark water boiling as the hideous beast lashes out at the Fellowship. Again, the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, flinging him in the air as the Fellowship battles the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle, and Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms. Legolas shoots an arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The Fellowship hurriedly backs away from the creature, retreating into the Moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rockslide that crashes down the cliff face. Earlier, Boromir had approached Frodo, smiling and ruffling his hair while seeming to grow in stature, as if absorbing the ring's power, with Frodo meeting Gandalf's eye, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. Aragorn had warily approached Boromir, who was motionless, staring at the ring as if transfixed. Aragorn unhanded his sword, and following the crows as they raced deeper and deeper, passing a vista of industry, hundreds of orcs, and writhing birthsacks, flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden gantry.",
    "325": "It gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun, green, gold, and silver. Beyond the River, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies on Lothlorien has not the power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond, step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn. Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face. Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam. Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. Aragorn kneels down beside him. Boromir looks at Aragorn in despair. Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart. Aragorn returns Boromir's smile, betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away. The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. Frodo's eyes flicker open as if by instinct. Galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug, a glow rises from the water. Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal, he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into the water. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface. Frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope. Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely. Frodo looks down, in his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at Galadriel. Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her. Galadriel suddenly laughs, a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. Frodo realizes what her message is. The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand, his fingers close over it. Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. The Uruk-hai are smearing themselves in white paint, a creepy ritualistic ceremony, the white hand of Isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. Lurtz is quickly armored, breastplate, leg guards, helmet, a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. Saruman addresses a crowd of 200 fully armed Uruk-hai.",
    "331": "All is quiet as Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room. Suddenly, a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free, and spins around to face his assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight, paranoia blazing in his eyes, his clothes dirty and ragged from much traveling, hair and beard much longer and unkempt, suspicious and alert. Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. Flames instantly consume the envelope, revealing the ring as it sinks into the red-hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs and lifts the ring out, then drops it into Frodo's hand, who reacts to its weight. The gold band of the ring shows fiery letters beginning to appear, a tiny inscription glowing red as if burning from within, emanating from the ring. Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard \"Mordor.\" The ring lies between them on the table as Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly, with a teasing glimpse of Gollum being tortured by the Orcs. On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm as out of the darkness thunder two Black Riders, a lethal sword swinging down at the small Hobbit bounder. Frodo thrusts the ring at Gandalf and throws clothes into a knapsack as Gandalf watches him, making plans. Frodo is preparing to leave as Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage. Gandalf freezes, moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension, raises his staff above the window, and slams it down on the intruder. There is a yelp of pain as Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room. Sam Gamgee sprawls across the floor, looking up in terror as Gandalf looms over him. Hobbiton is shrouded in a white veil of mist, revealing Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam hurrying across a plowed field, away from Hobbiton. Gandalf leads his horse as Frodo and Sam are carrying knapsacks. Gandalf leads Frodo and Sam under the cover of woods and takes Frodo to one side. Frodo nods, patting his pocket. Frodo and Sam are hiking over the gentle Shire countryside, wading through a shallow stream. Sam stops short, taking stock of his surroundings, takes a deep breath, and steps forward. Sam's brown, furry foot hits the ground as Frodo and Sam continue their journey. Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible as Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of Isengard, a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, enclosing beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains.",
    "333": "A long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. The sound of hooves is close. A sinister mounted Ringwraith steps into view, hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes. Frodo freezes in terror. The Ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place. He sits very still with his head bowed, listening. Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The Ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent, his head turning from side to side. Frodo is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands. His face is fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road. The Ringwraith spins around at the sound and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken. Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. The Black Rider turns and departs. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees, slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. Merry moves past Pippin, toward Frodo, watching intently. Sam keeps looking around nervously. The Four Hobbits sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. The silhouette of a Black Rider looms against the skyline. Merry looks at his friend, realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. The Hobbits break cover. Suddenly, a Ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running towards the wide, placid Brandywine river and the ferry. The Hobbits stampede across the Wharf and tumble onto the Ferry. Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the Ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry. Shrieking with rage, the Hobbits cover their ears. Sam and Merry shove off with the poles. The ferry slides out into the river, just as the Ringwraiths arrive. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. Lights of Bree, a small village of stone and half-timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin approaching the gatehouse, wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. A thick hedge surrounds the village, a great gate bars the western entrance. A surly gatekeeper glances down at them. The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the Hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree, the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light.",
    "334": "The tall Bree Folk loom over the nervous little hobbits Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin as they make their way through the narrow streets, with tall buildings towering above them and lights glowing dimly from behind thick curtains. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin come rushing in, and Frodo attracts the Inn Keeper's attention. Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar, where he sits chatting with locals. Sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long-stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel-stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur, then leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar, grabbing Pippin's sleeve and spilling his beer. Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider, who sheathes his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips. Meanwhile, the gatekeeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern, a look of fear on his face, approaching the closed gate with great apprehension. He peers out of his peephole before the gate crashes down on him as four Ringwraiths ride into Bree, flying down the empty streets like horsemen of the apocalypse. The front door flies open, and the four Ringwraiths rush into the Prancing Pony with wicked swords drawn, causing Butterbur to hide behind his bar trembling and sweating in terror. Pippin stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep as the door creaks open and the four Ringwraiths silently slide into the Hobbit's room, looming above each bed and raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits. Sam's eyes open wide just as, in unison, the Ringwraiths stab the hobbits in a slashing, hacking frenzy, stepping back from the slashed beds in triumph. However, a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow, causing the Ringwraiths to shriek with rage and Sam to sit up with a start. Another shredded pillow is revealed, with more shrieks of rage, and Pippin and Merry wake with a start. It is revealed that Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on Strider's bed, while Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the Hobbits' room. Strider, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest, with Frodo watching uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of the trees and Sam looking excited. Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest and across the windswept moors, with the hobbits suddenly stopping and unstrapping their knapsacks. Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam, then stares at Pippin blankly and turns away, shaking his head. An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it, and another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.",
    "336": "Deagol pulls on his rod but is hauled overboard and disappears underwater with a splash. Sméagol leans over the boat, and Deagol turns to look at him, a smirk on his face. Sméagol moves towards Deagol, jumps on him, strangles him, and rips the glittering ring from Deagol's limp hand. Sméagol slips the ring onto his finger, descends into madness, his body twists and distorts, becoming a creepy, shriveled wretch, and finally crawls into a dark cave beneath the Misty Mountains. A grim landscape covered in thorn bushes and the scars of recent fires, the dark Morgul Valley disappears up towards the mountains. Frodo and Sam are in a filthy culvert, Sam twitches in a restless sleep, but Frodo is awake, his hand trails down to the chain around his neck. A sudden hiss, Frodo quickly hides the ring as Gollum peers at them with gleaming eyes. Sam stirs, looks at Frodo, who shakes his head. Sam looks at the dead, brown twilight, below the lowering, the days are growing darker. The ground suddenly quivers, a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. Sam shoots Gollum a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack. He holds up a piece of dried Lembas bread to Frodo, who looks at Sam questioningly. Frodo and Sam follow Gollum as he leads them on the winding, torturous path, clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks. Gandalf leads Aragorn, Legolas, Théoden, and Gimli through the moving forest of Fangorn, which opens before them, creating an avenue of trees allowing them access along the old Isengard road. A thick, humid mist fills the forest. The forest separates ahead, revealing the ruins of Isengard. All about, the great stone wall is cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards. Far off, half veiled in the swirling steam, the Tower of Orthanc stands unbroken by the storm, pale waters lap about its feet. Two small hobbits, Merry and Pippin, are sitting on the smashed wall, a feast of bread, meats, and wine spread before them. They puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. Merry cuts Pippin off before he can respond in kind. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stare at the sight before them. Gandalf leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower. Treebeard, the giant Ent, strides towards them, alarming all but Gandalf. Gandalf stares up the long length of the dark tower, the old Ent nods his head wisely. Pippin, his eye caught by something lying in the water, the muddy waters glowing with a golden light. Aragorn turns as, quick as a flash, Pippin has jumped off his horse and picked up the Palantir.",
    "337": "Denethor continues with his meal as Faramir exits. Above Minas Morgul, on a small ledge next to the stairs, lie Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Sam watches a sleeping Gollum suspiciously, trying to stay awake, but slowly and inevitably, Sam falls asleep. Gollum's eyes snap open, and he sits up, quietly crawling towards Sam's knapsack. Sam breathes deeply, heavily asleep, as Gollum grimaces in distaste, pulling out the Lembas bread. He sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping Sam and throws the remaining Lembas bread over the cliff. Sam's eyes flick open, and Gollum spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, Sam turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder. Sam rummages through his knapsack for a bite to eat but stops, shock on his face. He slowly turns to Gollum, who slaps his hand against Sam's jacket, sending Lembas crumbs raining down. Enraged, Sam throws himself at Gollum, punching him, but Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum. Frodo collapses on the ground, and Sam's face shows horror. Sam attempts to fuss around Frodo, but a terrible light comes into Frodo's eyes as he stares into the earnest eyes of Sam. Frodo pushes Sam away, clutching at the Ring beneath his shirt, and rises to his feet with a frighteningly intense energy. Sam stares at Frodo with disbelief as tears well in his eyes and spill down his cheeks. Frodo turns, and he and Gollum leave, with Sam in complete misery. Faramir leads a column of 200 knights through the streets towards the city gate, with people rushing forward, throwing flowers over the knights. Gandalf hurries alongside Faramir's horse, reads the pain in Faramir's eyes, and calls after him, trying to stop the young man. Faramir leads the 200 mounted knights through the gates of Minas Tirith and across the Pelennor Fields towards the ruins of Osgiliath. The people of Minas Tirith watch as Faramir's knights fan out to form one straight line of 200 horsemen. Gothmog and his men watch as the knights approach, and Pippin looks on as Denethor eats. Gothmog rises amidst the ruins, and Faramir's knights, 75 yards away, thunder towards the camera. Behind Gothmog, all over the ruined city, 5000 orc archers rise to their feet with black arrows already strung on their bows. Faramir yells defiantly as his 200 knights ride straight into a black wall of flying arrows. Throughout this sequence, Denethor has continued to eat.",
    "34": "Strasser looks up from the book. Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand. Rick looks up from the book. Rick gets up. Rick walks away toward the gambling room. A couple comes in the front door. They are Victor Laszlo, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, Miss Ilsa Lund. The headwaiter comes up to them. As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman looks at Sam. She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare. Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past. After she has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction. He appears to know this woman. Berger, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance. The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table. Laszlo takes the chair opposite and surveys the room. Berger walks up to their table. Carefully lifting up the stone, he reveals. He holds it down for their view. Berger sits down with them. Ilsa tries to warn him. Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away. Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and soft. He sits down. Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction. Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters. Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly. There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or Laszlo. Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself. Laszlo stands. Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face. Renault and Strasser bow shortly. Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled. On the floor, Corina strums a guitar and begins her number. Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar. He rises and goes off. We see Ilsa's troubled profile. While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction. Ilsa watches him. At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place at the bar next to Berger. Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it. Berger shakes his head. Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly. He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo. Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite enthusiastically. Ilsa sits alone at her table. He sits down and is ready to play. Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for anything. Sam looks very uncomfortable. He seems even more scared now. Of course he can. Ilsa starts to hum.",
    "347": "Pippin reluctantly hands the Palantir to Gandalf, who immediately smothers it in his cloak. Gandalf looks back at Pippin, troubled. Meanwhile, a group of riders gallop towards the Rohan city of Edoras, where Éowyn stands alone outside the Golden Hall, waiting. A roaring fire and a lamb roasting on a spit, along with long tables laden with food and barrels of wine, indicate a banquet ready for the returning soldiers. Amidst the cheering crowd, Éowyn moves towards Aragorn, and as she offers him a chalice, their eyes meet. Éowyn looks at her uncle, King Théoden, who follows her gaze, and she looks at him questioningly, disturbed by his tone. She watches concerned as her uncle moves away. Merry and Pippin are singing loudly on top of one of the tables, both holding very large mugs of ale in their hands. Gandalf is laughing and clapping at the hobbits, and Aragorn steps up beside him, smiling at the show. Gandalf turns quickly to Aragorn, watching his friend's face, seeking reassurance. Elsewhere, Frodo and Sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool, with Smeagol nearby, muttering in his sleep. Smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror, and his features transform into the malevolent face of Gollum. Smeagol glances over his shoulder at the sleeping figures of Frodo and Sam as he clambers off his rock, sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool. He stares into the murky depths of the water, and the surface ripples as the face of Gollum appears as Smeagol's. Smeagol is seen choking Deagol, fingers locked tight around his throat, and his eyes flicker open. Sam's image is mirrored in the water as he smacks Gollum on the head with his pot and then flings himself on top of Gollum. Gollum screams, his arms and legs flailing wildly, and Frodo staggers over to Sam, pulling him off Gollum. Gollum, huddled on the ground sobbing, and Sam makes for Smeagol again with a look of murderous rage. Frodo grabs Sam's arm, but Sam pulls away from Frodo, staring at him at a loss. Sam's face softens, and Frodo beckons to Gollum. Gollum turns slowly, staring at Sam through hooded, hate-filled eyes, and smiles. Back in Edoras, Aragorn joins Legolas on the steps to the Golden Hall, oblivious to the chill wind. They look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond, with dark clouds marking the sky. Legolas looks at Aragorn, realisation in his face. Pippin suddenly hops out of bed, anxious, and creeps towards the sleeping form of Gandalf. Pippin gasps with fright as Merry sits up, wiping sleep from his eyes. Undeterred, Pippin moves on, even as Gandalf lies with eyes wide open.",
    "349": "They cartwheel into the air and land in a heap. The horse is dead. THEODEN lies dying beneath it. The Witch-King swooping down on his Fell-Beast, the Fell-Beast lands on THEODEN'S dead horse. The Fell-Beast opens its wicked jaws, a Rohan soldier stands before the beast. The Witch-King laughs. The Fell-Beast lifts EOWYN from her feet. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow, the Fell-Beast's head is severed, the huge creature crumples to the ground, vast wings out-stretched, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King rises out of the wreckage. EOWYN stands before him, the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword, with a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks EOWYN backwards with his mace. Stunned, EOWYN tries to stand and is hit once again with another crippling blow. EOWYN tries to block the blow but her shield shatters into many pieces, the Witch-King towers over EOWYN. An Orc Commander hurrying onto the Anduin River docks, close to the city. Large black shadows slide across the docks, as sailing ships approach O.S. A sinister black sailed ship glides into the docks, 9 other Corsair ships follow behind. The Orc Commander. ARAGORN leaping from the leading ship and charging across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs. He is followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI. Surprised Orc reaction to the three charging towards thousands of Orcs. The Army of the Dead suddenly leap straight out of the sides of the ships. They charge across the surface of the water with frightening speed, overtaking ARAGORN. The Orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors. The spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the Orc army. With a raging blood-lust, the undead climb over the top of each other to try and reach the enemy, creating a kind of rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. MERRY on the ground, he looks around to see the Witch-King standing over EOWYN, pulling her to her feet. MERRY drives his sword into the back of the Witch-King's knee, MERRY'S sword bursts into flame and his arm is shot with pain. EOWYN struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, her long hair tumbling onto her shoulders. With her last strength, EOWYN thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's face, EOWYN'S sword shatters into many shards, the Witch-King topples back dead, a black ooze leaking from his robes and armor, a shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail passes with the wind. ARAGORN and LEGOLAS battle the Orc, LEGOLAS jumps onto the back of a giant Mumakil bringing it down, he lands on his feet in front of GIMLI.",
    "35": "Sam begins to play the piano very softly and prepares to move it away, but stops to look at her for a long moment. Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar, and as Rick sees Ilsa, he stops short, appearing shocked. Sam stops playing as two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other. Rick sits down, and they look at each other while Laszlo signals the waiter. Rick takes the check, and Renault leaves. Ilsa smiles, and they join Renault at the curb. Sam realizes Rick is in a very grim mood and sits down at the piano to start playing softly again, improvising. Suddenly, Rick pounds the table and buries his head in his arms, then raises it, trying to regain control. He holds his head in his hands while Sam's playing is joined slowly by orchestra music. Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne. Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard, and the scenery changes to a country road as Ilsa snuggles close to him, putting her head on his shoulder. He puts his arm around her. They are on an excursion boat on the Seine, standing at the rail, seeming transported by each other as Ilsa laughs. The Arc de Triomphe is seen from a distance, and Ilsa walks over to join Rick. They drink and dance inside a swank Paris cafe, appearing very much in love as the music plays. Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick, and they kiss passionately. Newsreel footage shows the rubble of a burned-out, demolished building, German troops crossing a river, tanks rolling down the road toward Paris, and German war planes overhead. A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him, with much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table, buying a newspaper and beginning to read it. Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a loudspeaker on a wagon. Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne and walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano. Ilsa seems unnerved, with something on her mind. Rick pours the champagne, his manner wry but not bitter. Sam looks at his glass, and Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window. She smiles faintly, looking at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms and kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace, they hear the dull boom of cannons. Ilsa reacts worriedly, looking at Rick, who chuckles and then chuckles again.",
    "350": "The Mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up their sides, routing the Haradrim from their war-towers. Orcs flee in their thousands as the Army of the Dead swarms over the city, routing the orcs. Eowyn crawls to where Theoden lays, mortally wounded. Theoden looks up at Eowyn, his breathing shallow, his vision clouded. Eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face. Theoden is dying. The Army of the Dead slowly dissolves into dust and is immediately swept away by the four winds. Aragorn turns to Gandalf who bows his head in homage. Pippin, in his Gondorian armor, looks around at the devastation, his eyes full of sadness. His eyes suddenly fix on something, and Pippin runs through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. Merry stares unseeing at Pippin, horror and shock erasing all other memories from Merry's mind. Tears fall down Pippin's face as he looks on his friend. Pippin covers Merry with a blanket. The camera rises towards the dark orc tower of Cirith Ungol, where a light glows from the topmost window. The camera reaches the tower, dissolving through the wall into a small cold room where Frodo Baggins is unconscious on the floor. His eyes suddenly flicker and he wakes up. Frodo realizes that he has been stripped down to his underwear and clutches at his throat, finding that the ring has gone. Gorbag and Shagrat, an orc and Uruk-hai, argue over Frodo's belongings and clothes, with Gorbag snatching for the mithril vest. Gorbag grabs for the mithril vest and draws his sword, but Shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. Gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below, landing in the guard room with a crash and creating sudden alarm amongst the orcs and Uruk-hai stationed there. Shagrat leans through the trap door as several Uruk-hai converge on Gorbag. Gorbag lashes out, slashing one across the throat with his sword. The dead Uruk-hai topples backwards over the parapet, landing on top of Uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. Within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in Cirith Ungol. Sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for Frodo, and is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and Uruk-hai strewn over the courtyard. Sam pounds up the staircase but suddenly pauses as several Uruk-hai are running down towards him. He grips Sting and continues charging up, screaming at the top of his lungs. The four Uruk-hai see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them, turn around, and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. Sam appears and, before the Uruk-hai can fully regain their wits, he slays three.",
    "351": "Sam runs into the tower. Frodo struggles against his bonds as Gorbag climbs back into the room. Gorbag grabs Frodo's hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck. He pulls out his sword, ready to cut Frodo's throat. Suddenly, Gorbag gasps as Sting is rammed into his back. Gorbag falls dead. Frodo is humbled by Sam's unswerving loyalty. Sam quickly cuts Frodo free. Sam pulls the Ring from his pocket. Frodo looks at Sam amazed, his eyes drop to the Ring. Sam hesitates. Tension instantly builds between them. Sam seems strangely reluctant. On the soundtrack, the hum of the Ring builds. Sam drops the Ring into Frodo's palm. Frodo sags in relief. He puts the Ring back around his neck. Frodo looks at Sam, pain in his eyes. Sam looks down at Frodo, his plain hobbit face full of compassion. Sam's resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold. Frodo and Sam are now dressed in foul-looking orc gear. Frodo and Sam turn east and walk over the summit of Cirith Ungol into Mordor. They stop dead. Mount Doom, 50 miles away across the barren Gorgoroth plateau, is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of Mordor with a flickering orange wash. With immense trepidation, Frodo and Sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. Two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before them lies the plain of Gorgoroth. Their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of Mount Doom. Frodo's eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them; thousands upon thousands of orcs are encamped there. Their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape. A red light seems to sweep across the plain. The great eye of Sauron! Sam cannot see what Frodo sees. Gently, he urges Frodo on. Gandalf stands in the tower hall. He turns and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of Gimli, Legolas, Eomer, and Aragorn. Aragorn, his back to Gandalf. Gandalf, still troubled, still worried. Gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward. Gandalf looks across at the dwarf, his face ashen. Aragorn turns around suddenly. Gandalf looks up sharply at Aragorn. At this, Gimli chokes on his pipe. Eomer steps forward. Aragorn wears a breast plate emblazoned. He rides at the head of a column of 500-foot soldiers from Rohan and Gondor, leading them from the ruins of Osgiliath. Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin ride directly behind him. Great armies of orc and uruk-hai stream across the plains from Mordor. The volcanic wasteland of the Gorgoroth foothills. Frodo and Sam, still disguised in the orc armor, slide down scree bank and land on the road below.",
    "353": "Some men are backing away, losing their nerve. Aragorn gallops in front of his army, seeming to fix each and every one of his men with his eyes. He holds Anduril aloft. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are climbing the face of Mount Doom. The landscape is violent, with red heat hissing out of fissures, and the rock is jagged, razor sharp. Ash blankets the land. Red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. Frodo and Sam's feet drag across the ash, their parched lips and sweating, dusty faces evident. Frodo trips and falls face-first into the dust. Sam drops beside him. Of Aragorn's army, they are totally surrounded by 300,000 orcs poised for the order to attack. Frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up the steep slopes of Mount Doom, a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone. He starts to crawl on his hands and knees, hauling himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. Gimli surveys the army of Mordor and looks up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared so much. The gruff dwarf smiles quietly. Sam crawls to Frodo, who lies slumped against the rock-face, turns him over, and holds him in his arms. Frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps. Sam looks at Frodo with grim determination and lifts Frodo onto his shoulders, starting to climb Mount Doom. His plain hobbit-face grows stern as the will hardens in him. Two tiny hobbits are on the endless shale slopes. Aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of orcs. Aragorn raises Anduril in a broad sweep as he walks forward, turns to face the others, and with quiet resolve written on his face, he charges forward with his sword raised. There is a moment of silence, then suddenly a shout goes up as Pippin and Merry charge forward, followed by the rest of the men. Aragorn crashes head-on into a line of orcs, the blade of Anduril flashing as he hacks at them. Like a small grey insect, Sam creeps up the slope with Frodo on his back, foot by foot. The mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of Barad-Dur, the Dark Tower, in the distance. Sam staggers under Frodo's weight, with strong ash-laden winds buffeting him as he slowly climbs Mount Doom. The plain of Gorgoroth lies 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. A tremor ripples through the ground, and a red flame explodes into the sky. Sam looks up, fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. Through the thick, fume-laden air, a set of stairs can be made out.",
    "355": "Frodo materializes and drops to his knees, clutching his bleeding hand and screams. The fires below roar in anger, red light blazes, and the cavern fills with a great glare and heat. Legolas looks on as Aragorn falls to the ground. Gollum triumphantly holds the Ring aloft and dances gleefully, perilously close to the edge of the chasm. Aragorn turns to see huge troll feet moving closer while Legolas races toward him. Gollum remains triumphant on the edge of the precipice, the fiery lava casting an evil light. He jumps about as Frodo rises slowly, his eyes locking on Gollum. Time seems to stand still as they regard each other, the Ring glinting in Gollum's hand. Suddenly, Frodo lunges at Gollum, thudding into him and lifting him off his feet. Frodo and Gollum, locked in struggle, plummet over the edge of the chasm. The huge foot of the cave troll lands on Aragorn's chest, and he stabs at it ineffectually. Gandalf watches in despair while Sam watches in horror as Frodo and Gollum disappear into the chasm. Gollum falls into the Crack of Doom, instantly engulfed in churning lava. Sam leans into the Crack of Doom as Frodo clings onto the rock face with his one hand. The caverns shake violently, and Sam desperately reaches for him. Frodo is too far down, looks at Sam impassively, struggles to reach Sam, but can't reach with his bleeding hand and falls back, still clinging to the rock. Frodo looks at Sam imploringly, reaches up once more, and this time Sam grasps his hand tightly. The Ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. The Eye of Sauron appears, and across the great plains, Mount Doom is clearly visible. On the battlefield, all eyes turn to Mount Doom. The cave troll, with Aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from Mordor, turns in terror, and runs off. The Fellowship watches as the massive dark tower of Sauron shakes itself to pieces, towers fall, and walls crumble. Vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up, and the foundations explode apart. The Black Gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash, and the orcs flee in all directions. As the very foundations of Mordor collapse, the Company watches as Mount Doom explodes. The reason for their misery is clear, and it's plain Frodo and Sam can never survive the cataclysm. The volcano is erupting, fire belches from its riven summit, sending lava streaming down its sides. Frodo and Sam stagger out of the Sammath Naur as ash and molten rocks fall all around. The skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning.",
    "357": "Aragorn and Arwen look on Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippint as they stand before them. The four hobbits, dressed in their old clothes, clean and mended, bow their heads. Aragorn raises his hand, then drops on one knee, kneeling before the hobbits, his head bowed, followed by all assembled there. Tears spring into Frodo's eyes and he clutches Sam's shoulder as 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the Shire. The camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel, until Minas Tirith becomes a speck in the landscape, dissolving into a parchment map of Middle-earth. It slowly drifts across the map towards the west, revealing Hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride into shot on ponies, past Odo Proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. Frodo brings a round of drinks to the table. Nearby a huge fuss is being made of a large pumpkin which has been brought in to be shown off. The four friends look at each other, a world of experience now separates them from their fellow hobbits. Seated at a long table, the four friends raise their glasses. Sam's eye is suddenly caught. An angle on Rosie Cotton, who is serving behind the bar. Sam steels himself and leaves to go and talk to Rosie. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin exchange smiles as on a beautiful sunny day, Sam and Rosie are married, with their dearest friends gathered around them. Rosie throws a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and it's caught by Pippin who smiles in embarrassment. Frodo walks through Bag End to his study. He is hunched over a desk, to reveal Bilbo's red book open on Frodo's desk. He is writing in the last chapters, in careful neat handwriting, turning back the pages to reveal: \"There and Back Again -- A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.\" He writes below it as Sam Gamgee calls out from the door. Frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain, and he puts the pen down and clutches at his shoulder. Sam has entered the room and stands behind Frodo, he is drawn and pale, Sam is at a loss for words. On a cold winter's morning out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon, Gandalf is at the reins. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon, all are wearing their grey elven robes. Gandalf arrives in his cart. The wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride behind, leading Frodo's empty pony. Frodo is sitting in the wagon, his arm around his uncle Bilbo. Bilbo is extremely old and frail, he is dozing, his head slumped, Bilbo's eyes flutter open.",
    "358": "Merry sits up, a worried look on his face. Pippin unwraps the Palantir and as Merry looks on horrified, he gazes intently into it. As Pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light slowly spreads from the glass ball onto Pippin's face. Pippin suddenly starts to hyperventilate. The great eye of Sauron seems to leap from the fire. Pippin is bathed in the fiery red light. Pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream. He falls backwards, powerless to release the fiery. Gandalf wakes with a start! Just as Aragorn enters, and wrenches the Palantir from Pippin’s hands. Aragorn spins away, reeling backwards, the Palantir falling from his hands. The Palantir rolls across the floor, causing everyone in the room to cower back. Gandalf throws a blanket over it, angry disbelief on his face! He rounds on Pippin. Gandalf lifts the hobbit's slumped head. A lone white tree silhouetted by flames. Gandalf stares at Pippin with a frightening. Theoden stands in the Golden Hall, gravely listening to Gandalf. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli look on. Gimli lets out a sigh of relief. Gandalf turns to look at Theoden. Gandalf looks from one to the other of the gathered company. The wizard turns towards Aragorn. Theoden listens intently, saying nothing. He knows Gandalf speaks the truth. Gandalf rounds on Theoden. Theoden holds Gandalf's gaze. Aragorn turns to look at Theoden. Gandalf turns on his heel. Gandalf hurries along the streets. Pippin and Merry run alongside trying to keep up. Pippin catches up to Merry. Merry turns away. This is too much for Merry. He turns on Pippin. Pippin's face as Merry strides away. Pippin is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of Shadowfax as Gandalf hurriedly prepares to leave. Merry thrusts a small package into Pippin's hand. Pippin stares down at the leather-bound bundle of pipe-weed. A worried Merry exchanges glances with Gandalf. Gandalf mounts Shadowfax. Gandalf spurs the great horse forward. Shadowfax thunders out of the stables! Close on: Merry's devastated face. Shadowfax carried Gandalf and Pippin out of the gate and down the winding road towards the plains of Rohan. Merry clambers up a watchtower, Aragorn in pursuit. The small figure as he watches his best friend disappear into the distance. He knows what it is to lose someone. Arwen -- escorted by a small entourage of elves -- rides through the gathering darkness of a pine forest. As Arwen rides through the forest the figure of a small boy of about 5 suddenly runs across the path in front of her. Arwen reigns in Asfaloth. Something about the boy intrigues her -- but she does not know why. As Arwen watches the boy moves away, the trees begin to thin.",
    "359": "The boy continues running as, one by one, the trees transform into tall white pillars. The boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of Minas Tirith. A silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child. The boy runs to the figure. Arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms, swinging the laughing child into the air. The figure turns to reveal Aragorn, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble. The child, now in Aragorn's arms, looks directly at Arwen. It is a quiet look filled with infinite sadness. Arwen's eyes drop to the child's chest. Around the child's neck hangs the Evenstar. Arwen realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the child she and Aragorn will never have. Elrond speaks to his daughter. Arwen shuts her eyes. When she opens them again, the vision is gone. She is staring at dark trees once more. Arwen turns towards her companion who stares at her, concerned. Arwen wheels Asfaloth around, riding away. Arwen's horse gallops over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell. Elrond is seated alone. Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, stunned. Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards Elrond with a fierce light in her eyes. Elrond's face is grim. Her father turns away. Elrond stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him. He won't look at her. Arwen gently takes her father's face in her hands and turns him toward her. A hooded figure ascends a curved staircase towards a gallery. The figure stops before a statue that holds the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. The blade shatters in several fragments as Isildur brandishes Narsil at Sauron. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful face of the statue. The figure is Arwen. Elrond stares at his daughter, unwavering. A broken sword glows with red heat. Its blade in several fragments. A heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil. As elven-smiths temper the steel. Elrond's face lit by flickering fire as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water. Light shimmers as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was broken has been remade. Pippin is asleep. Gandalf's protective arm around him as Shadowfax thunders through the night. Shadowfax powers along the countryside. Pippin, huddled in front of Gandalf, the wind sailing through his hair. Shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge. Before them is the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, its tall white face whitening in the rising sun. Upon its outthrust knee is the guarded city: Minas Tirith.",
    "364": "Gandalf spurs Shadowfax forward with Pippin clinging tightly to the horse's mane. Faramir, sword in hand, remains at the rear, trying desperately to fend off the deadly assault. Again the Fell-beasts dive low. Gandalf thunders into view, raising his staff. A shaft of white light suddenly stabs upwards, causing the Nazgul to swerve away from the light as it pierces the low cloud. For a brief moment, sunlight streams through the hole onto Pelennor Fields. The Nazgul circle away from the sun rays, swiftly spiraling higher and higher. The Nazgul defeated, Gandalf and the Rangers ride towards the safety of Minas Tirith. Iorlas runs towards the gates, yelling. The great gates open, allowing Gandalf, Pippin, Faramir, and the Osgiliath survivors to ride in. Nearly 100 wounded. As Gandalf pulls Shadowfax up, Faramir steers his horse through the crowd towards him. Faramir suddenly stares at Pippin. Gandalf reads the surprise in his eyes. Faramir shakes his head. Gandalf is deeply troubled. Frodo and Sam follow Gollum up the dizzying stairway, carved into the sheer cliff. The steps are narrow, unevenly spaced, and many are broken. They are so steep that Frodo and Sam climb as if on a ladder, their desperate fingers clinging to the steps above, trying not to look at the long black fall below them. Frodo's foot slips and for a brief moment, he is hanging precariously from the rock-face. Gollum peers down from above, having reached the ledge. Frodo tries to clamber up onto the ledge. As he does, the Ring slips out of his shirt and dangles in full view of Gollum. Gollum rears back in shock, tensing like a cat. Frodo, head bowed, tries to pull himself up. Gollum's fingers close in on the Ring. Sam, still teetering on the precipitous stairs, is startled. Frodo looks down at Sam, losing his footing in the process. Sam's horrified face as Gollum's out-stretched hand suddenly grasps Frodo's arm, pulling him safely onto the ledge. Gollum glares down at Sam. Gollum blinks, masking the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. Gollum creeps close to Frodo and whispers in his ear. Frodo looks at Sam, his hand strays to his neck, closing tight around the Ring. High above Osgiliath, the sinister profile of the Witch King seated on a Fell Beast as Gothmog stands, awaiting his orders. Reactions of Gondorian soldiers upon the Minas Tirith. Anxious soldiers crowd around Gandalf. Dressed in over-sized armor, Pippin kneels before Denethor. Denethor proffers his ring which Pippin kisses. Denethor gently raises Pippin's head. Denethor's eyes meet Pippin's. Denethor addresses his meal. Faramir finally realizes the truth. For a brief second, Denethor seems to hesitate, then Faramir bows low to Denethor, turns to leave, stops, turns back.",
    "367": "Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit and loads a silver bullet. Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off and rolls to his feet. The hell hound squares back on its haunches, growling, ready for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming the revolver at the dog. At the last moment, Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom fires. The bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down. The carnies gasp. Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, ready to strike it. Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch. Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can. The dog bounds after it. It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth. Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new direction. Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned. He follows it into the woods. Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches. Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates. Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there as soon as possible. Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. We descend on the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain. He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing students, it could be any era. Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a young woman, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight. He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. On Sandra, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say is. She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, we see a diamond. On Edward as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front.",
    "369": "She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined. Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom. Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife. In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time. Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking letter. Reading it, his face drops. FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence. With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook. The JUMP LEADER yells. One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. When his time comes, Edward leaps. Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the plane. A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show. A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. He can't steer. He's helpless. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. The curtain rises to reveal PING at a microphone. She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING. UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. The two men begin to SCUFFLE. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony. Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister. Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to look. Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting GUARD looks in. Pretending to be her bitchy sister. The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. Even Ping is a little affected.",
    "37": "Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out. He stops and addresses Rick politely. As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression. At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell. Rick walks up behind Ilsa. She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is politely formal. Ilsa turns her head away. She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in stunned disbelief. Ilsa and Laszlo sit with Ferrari. Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away. Ilsa smiles faintly. She smiles again. At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter. Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar. Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa. There's a moment's pause as this sinks in. Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes. Ferrari bows. The European picks his pocket. The tourist laughs. He dashes off and collides with Carl. Carl leaves. As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up. He pours a drink for Renault. Renault gets up and strolls away. At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders. She indicates with her hand where she wants them. A French officer at the bar makes a remark to Yvonne. They begin to fight. Strasser eyes him closely. He smiles. Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away. Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged German couple, the Leuchtags. Carl sits down. He produces a glass from a back pocket. They clink glasses and drink. Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the Gambling room. Annina sees Rick and goes to his table. Rick looks at her. Annina shakes her head. Rick pours himself a drink. Annina is very disturbed. Rick looks at her closely. Rick stares off into space. Rick abruptly rises. Laszlo looks around. Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter. Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. He shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table. Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips left and seems bewildered. As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to Jan. Rick stands behind Jan. Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand. Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier understands what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel. He pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two. The wheel stops spinning. Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated. Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands. Carl continues to watch. The wheel spins. It stops. Jan rises to go to the cashier. A customer complains to Carl. Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier. Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door.",

Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, firing both into the ceiling. Screams erupt all around. The skinny security guard makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. The guard takes out his gun and slides it over. The teller woman nods. Edward, not sure what to do, has a gun but truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The teller woman is already waving him to the back. Edward decides he better go. The teller woman is crying as she works the combination. Edward feels horrible. She pulls open the vault door. The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair. Edward winces but doesn't say anything yet. He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside, even some dimes and pennies. Caught, Edward has to confess. Edward continues his narration. Norther leans in the driver's side window. Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in. The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the last moment, Norther calls out. Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip. The Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood, is revealed. Bubbles rise from Edward's nose for a few beats, then stop. It's quiet, except for the distant splashing of water from the spigot. Edward's eyes are closed. A long beat, then another. Edward opens one eye, then the other. He sits up to find Sandra sitting on the edge of the tub. He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub. A beat while she considers. Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind. When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes. He wipes them away. Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will has made it through another file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash. He's about to toss a file when he stops and takes another look. Something doesn't make sense. Sandra hands him five dollars out of her pocket. He's out the door in a flash. While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. A long beat. Jenny is taken aback by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.",
    "372": "Late and pensive, Edward is startled when the first raindrops hit the windshield. He turns on the wipers, but suddenly a deluge descends, like being caught in a waterfall, loud and pounding. He puts on the handbrake, and just as suddenly, the sound changes to soft splashing. The world is close and echoing because the car is underwater, the tires still on the road but surrounded by water. Three catfish swim in front of his headlights. Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm as water trickles in through the window crack, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. That’s when he sees her—The Girl in the River, swimming outside the car. We never see her face exactly, but she remains just as beautiful and mysterious as the first time. She puts her hand to the windshield, and he puts his up to meet hers, smiling. In the morning, the sun shines brightly, birds chirp, and trees drip as the grass shines, still wet from last night’s rain. The car balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. He pulls out and rubs off a key—the Key to the City he lost years ago. Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance. Amazed and disbelieving, he walks down the center of the road, seeing his faded shoes still dangling from the power line with the rest of the town’s. We look around the town, moving through a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate men in suits stand out among the bidders. Edward pitches his plan to Norther and talk expressively and passionately to Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway. Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped. The sun is shining, barely penetrating the trees’ thick canopy. In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it’s nearly fallen. He walks toward it, the marshy ground squishing up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. Edward knocks on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself. The inside is nicer than expected, a real home. With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. Without turning, she speaks and keeps playing. Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished, and turns to face him. Edward still doesn’t recognize her, puzzled and surprised to hear her speak.",
    "376": "Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar. Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door. He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally. Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the gate. The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. Dead. We RUSH IN on Don Price. Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout. Very much dead. Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears in his eyes. The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles. Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him. The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth. The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye. This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. The Old Woman nods. Heading back to the house. DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs. He judges her belly. He leans close to her, whispering in her ear. She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. They CREAK with every step. The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step. A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.",
    "379": "Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton, a tiny town in a tiny valley. Karl smiles, but then it fades, struck by a certain sad suspicion. Karl thinks a moment, then they shake on it. In a single shot, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. Spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl. There are a few tears amid the familiar faces. Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck. The crowd cheers, and with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go. Only Don Price, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go. Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with her. The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him. Although we're very close, we can't hear her voice. The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. We tilt up from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions. Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger. Karl looks at the dirt road, wary, a little paranoid. Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry. The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is still shining, and the birds still chirping. The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Coming around a bend, his pitch drops as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is dead quiet. He looks back the way he came, but Edward presses on. He carefully steps through the thorns. Just then a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs. Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.",
    "380": "Ahead lies a tiny one-street town, smaller even than Ashton, with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above are two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group of about 20 citizens spilling out to see Edward approach. Most are smiling. What's more, all of these people are barefoot. A forty-year-old man named Beamen comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard. Beamen checks the clipboard, still looking, still confused. A helpful woman named Mildred chimes in. Beamen's daughter Jenny, 8, hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger. He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing. Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by Norther Winslow, 30, who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. Suddenly, Jenny yanks off Edward's shoes. She races for the door. He chases after her. As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw. The gathered citizens of Spectre cheer for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his hand. Still focused on his shoes. The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward. Norther grabs his notebook back. Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him. Embarrassed to admit it. He starts to wade back to the bank. Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin. Eager to get off this subject. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers. The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two women have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From farmer to baker's wife, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast. Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly. Beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her.",
    "381": "Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear over the music. Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd. With that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads. Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy. Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could. Edward keeps walking. Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. It's horrible. Almost unendurable. And then it gets worse. The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood cracking and groaning, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him. Snake-like white roots shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of lightning. As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud. Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. He screams up at the night, until his breath is gone. With a sudden calm. Another lightning flash, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And laughing. His bare foot steps onto asphalt. Edward turns to see to his right, coming down the larger, paved road. Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet. With that, the men start walking down the larger road. Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual. The other three eat awkwardly, each clink and scrape of a knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks. All three stop to listen. She smiles. He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods. She shakes her head. A long beat. Then, deadpan. He rolls his eyes, why not. Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. We stay with Edward in bed. Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.",
    "383": "We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. It is late, the supermarket all but deserted. We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs. She waits, arms folded. The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. A small black-and white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. His head is plunged into the toilet. Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. His head is plunged back into the toilet. The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. His head is plunged back in. The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. Looming over him is a strapping blond man. Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug. He starts peeing on the rug. The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses. The blond man stops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native. The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses. The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile. The two men look at each other. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them.",
    "387": "He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin. One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs. Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter, then nervously takes the Dude by the elbow. The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman, and continues to look back over his shoulder as he is led away. Scattered by a strike. Donny calls out from the bench. As the Dude walks back to the scoring table, he turns to another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that shares the lane. He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail. Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. Walter takes out a gun. Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. As the two men get into the car, Walter is still smug. A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-up old furniture. At the table next to the answering machine, the Dude is mixing kahlua, rum, and milk. A beep. It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans. The Dude takes a swig of his kahlua. We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway. Brandt talks back over. Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. He turns back around and the firelight shows tear tracks on his cheeks. He clears his throat. Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice is hushed. We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up. He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket. Donny has been watching Quintana. They both look up. Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.",
    "391": "Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. The Dude is encouraged and takes a hurried sip from his drink. Brandt hands him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside. The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it. The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside. The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. A waitress enters. The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him. He looks defiantly around. A dripping noise. The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head. The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub. After the Dude's outgoing message we hear. The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying. One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor. Two other men are entering behind him. The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal. The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub. The Dude screams. The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. The three men turn to leave. They have reached the Dude's car. The driver's side exterior has been scraped raw. The policeman hands the Dude a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror. The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly. The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. Walter sadly shakes his head. They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar. As he stares. He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome. He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat. We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. The Stranger nods. Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar. His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude. The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is. The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar.",
    "392": "He is gone. She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut. The Dude stops between two albums and pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture of three young Germans, their foreheads looming below slicked-back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany. They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits. A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover. The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot. Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, looks at the two men. Walter pops the latches on his attaché case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry. Walter is still holding out the homework. Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him. As he shoves the homework back in the attaché case. He is heading for the door. Walter is striding down the lawn with his attaché case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman. Without looking back at, the Dude, who follows. He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron. CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. CRASH! He takes out the driver's window. Lights are going on in houses down the street. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby. When the door is opened--outwards, The chair clatters to the floor. Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. She is topless. She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky. A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion. It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters. A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears.",
    "393": "The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor. He hands him the drink. He taps his forehead with one finger. Treehorn waves this off. He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily. He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song. She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. He is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping. The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.",
    "396": "She goes inside a building with him following her. She downs a drink and motions for another, with tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face, then she sits down and he joins her. He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue, then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. Dil's face stares at him. She allows herself to be led out. Dil and Fergus walk together until Fergus stops her by the window. They walk inside and stand in the darkness. He sits her down in one of the chairs and Dil nods. Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair but her head leaps back. She stares at him and takes a breath. Fergus begins to cut her hair with a close-up on Dil's face as her hair is shorn, and tears stream down her cheeks. She looks in the mirror at it in the dark. Dil enters with her new haircut and goes to turn on the light, but he stops her hand. She looks at her hand on his and her fingers close around his. She brings her lips to his neck and he lets them stay there. His hands travel up to her blouse and he begins to undo the buttons. He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She stretches languorously down on it and turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress, revealing she is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt. But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. Dil, on the bed, slowly turns and sees Fergus coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark. Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position and wraps the shirt around her. She kisses him. Fergus leads Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes, looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. A car pulls up at the site and Jude gets out with a satchel in her hand. Fergus looks down a ladder-staircase at Jude and climbs down a ladder to her. She hands him something from the bag and kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly and opens what Jude has given him, looking inside to find a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. Fergus enters the room, which is empty, and he calls out. He runs outside and looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him.",
    "399": "The room is alive with screams, men awake and grabbing guns. A woman is screaming, taking in huge gobs of air. She rubs her hand on a man's chest and sidles closer, coming on to him. Fergus walks over to Jody, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes a sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats slowly and Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth. Jody eats the last bits. Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse, carrying a pot of tea and two cups. It is sweltering now in the greenhouse and the hood is drenched with sweat. Jude comes into view and lays the tea on the ground. Jody's breathing becomes labored. Fergus gives Jude the gun. Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves. Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap. Fergus enters and Maguire has a newspaper with a headline regarding the kidnapping. Jude drinks tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters again and the woman goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off. Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes in mighty gulps of air and smiles. Fergus smiles back, pours out a cup of tea, and brings it to Jody's lips. Fergus drinks and looks at Jody. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea. Jody fingers the gun on his lap and looks at Fergus. Fergus holds the gun to Jody's face and fishes inside Jody's inside pocket. Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet containing credit cards, army identification photograph. Fergus takes out a picture of Jody in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat, and smiles. Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and a beautiful black woman, smiling. Jody chuckles and Fergus looks at him. Jody keeps looking at Fergus and smiles. Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him. Jody walks toward the wall, breathing heavily. Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him. Fergus turns Jody around and unzips his fly, holding his hands from behind so Jody can lean forward. Jody pisses with immense relief, shakes his body, and steps back. Fergus leads him back toward the greenhouse and to his chair. Jody begins to laugh and Fergus begins to laugh without knowing why. Maguire, walking out of the house, is woken by the sound of laughter. Jody is still laughing when suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head. Maguire stands there in the dark, looking at Fergus. Fergus gets up slowly and walks toward the door. Maguire sits with an Armalite in his hands, watching him. The sun comes up over the low hills around the farmhouse.",
    "4": "He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. They laugh. She lays back on the bed. Her mind wanders for a beat. Jane looks at him and sits up. She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes blue. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. We're flying above Robin Hood Trail. We see the Burnham's house below us as we approach it steadily. We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway. We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. The blender grinds as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out. Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her. Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. Angle on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes. We're outside Ricky's room, moving slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now. A reverse angle reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious. Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house. Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants. The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. Close on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.",
    "400": "Fergus enters with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is sitting where he sat before, stock-still. Maguire shakes his head, then shakes his head again and looks hard at Fergus. He rises, drags Fergus out the door, then goes back to the house. Jody is sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters and says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward Jody, lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him. Fergus keeps feeding him, says nothing, and shakes his head. Jody eats, and Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody, says nothing. Jody chuckles under his hood. Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles up at him, and Fergus laughs. She pulls the hood down over Jody and whacks him with a pistol. Fergus lifts the hood a bit to reveal Jody's mouth, now with blood on his lips. Fergus is moved and walks toward Jody. Their faces are close to each other as Fergus searches out her picture. The door opens and Maguire is there with another man. Fergus turns toward him, walks toward Maguire, and the other man walks forward and takes his seat. Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others are present. Maguire lights a cigarette, and Fergus looks at him and nods. He turns back to Fergus, and Fergus leaves, taking his place in the chair beside Jody. Jody begins to laugh under the hood. Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke. Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips. Jody coughs but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth and is silent, his eyes wet. The farmhouse is covered in mist. Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand and takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his back, by the elbow. Jody rises, and Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire. Fergus turns with sudden fierceness and pulls Jody through the fields, pushing him through a copse of trees, the gun at his back. Fergus pulls the hood off, and Jody looks around him, having a cut lip where Jude struck him. Fergus prods him on with the gun, and Jody stumbles forward. Fergus is all cold and businesslike. Jody suddenly sprints, loosening the ties on his hands and freeing them. Fergus screams in fury after him, aims, then changes his mind and runs. Fergus gains on him, stretches his arm out, but Jody sprints ahead again. He laughs in exhilaration while Fergus pants behind him, wheezing, almost laughing.",
    "407": "Ben's eyes open suddenly. A camera pulls back slowly from a closeup of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft. The camera then pulls back from a closeup of Ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead, their headsets on, with Ben motionless. The bed Ben is lying on moves as if someone sat down next to him. As Ben speaks, the door to the bedroom opens and Mrs. Braddock looks in. Ben and Mr. Braddock move out of the door, with Mr. Braddock steering Ben. Phil and Mimi Carlson are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks are moving down. Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink. Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely. They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs. Ben moves to the front door and opens it. Mr. Loomis steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand. He closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room. Ben moves back to the stairway as three ladies come out of the living room. One lady takes Ben's right hand, another his left, and the third fingers the front of his jacket. Mr. McQuire appears behind Ben. They look at each other for a moment before Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house. The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. Ben goes into the house through the back door. Through the windows, Ben is seen making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs, and to his room. There is a sound of a door slamming. Ben stands with his back against the door. In a long shot over Ben, the pool area and people below are visible. There is a sound of the door opening. Ben turns. Mrs. Robinson enters the room. They stand for a moment, looking at each other. Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. She takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it, then blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match, and puts it in the wastebasket. Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson a set of car keys. Mrs. Robinson looks at him and shakes her head. She throws the keys to him. Ben gets out and goes around to her side and opens the door. They move to the door. She takes out her key and opens the door.",
    "408": "Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages, with Ben a step or two behind her. Carl strides up to them, takes the pipe out of his mouth, puts it in his pocket, and reaches out to take Elaine's hands. He frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben, who smiles and steps forward to grasp Carl's hand. Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder. The three of them look at each other for a moment. There is another KNOCK. Elaine is standing in the hall. Ben nods, moves in behind her, and puts his hand on her arm. Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see into the room. Ben edges through the door into the hallway, opens the door a little way, and they all try to see in. The boys start back to their rooms. Mr. McCleery and Ben stand and look at each other for a few seconds. Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts down the stairs. Ben turns and goes back into the room. Elaine sits in the chair and watches him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer, puts them in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau. He gets down on his knees and looks under the bureau, goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear, and carries them to the suitcase. He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out some T-shirts and the beer can, and carries them to the suitcase. Elaine gets up, goes to the door, opens it, walks out, and shuts the door behind her. Ben crosses to the window. Past Ben, through the window, we see Elaine walking away. She walks the length of the street and disappears. Ben is asleep in his bed, then suddenly sits up. Standing in the darkness by the door, he gets out of the bed, goes to her, and they kiss. She shakes her head, then nods, goes to the door, opens it, and steps into the hall. He goes to the door. Students are moving quickly from building to building. Ben is walking alongside Elaine. They move up the steps of a classroom building. Ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with Elaine. They walk down a corridor. On each side are open doors to classrooms with students filing into each of them. Elaine turns into one of the doors. Ben is left in the hall. All the doors in the classrooms close. He leans against the wall.",
    "410": "Ben turns and walks down the hall. They enter the sunroom. She nods. He looks at her. She pours herself a drink, then hands him a drink. She turns on the phonograph. Ben looks at her again. They look at each other. Ben is half standing, then puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair. She looks at him. We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room. Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait. In the background, Mrs. Robinson watches him. He steps back. She turns her back. Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down. Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor. Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall. The camera pushes with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall. Ben gets to the stairs and starts down. She walks out of the shot. Ben starts back up the stairs. He appears as he slowly climbs the stairs. Ben gets to the top of the stairs and starts slowly down the hall. Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed and puts the purse down. As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait. There is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait. He turns quickly. Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her. She smiles. Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs. Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down. Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. There is a sound of the front door opening and closing. Footsteps approach the sunroom. Mr. Robinson enters. Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass, then takes the glass from him. Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Mr. Robinson turns and brings him the drink. Ben shakes his head, then nods. Mrs. Robinson enters the room. She is now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up, then sits. Mrs. Robinson nods. He stands. Mr. Robinson stands up with him. They start out of the sunroom. Ben nods. Ben continues to walk toward us. The sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, and the Arnold children, Peter and Louise, who are eight or nine. Watching from across the fence on one side of the house are the young girl from next door and her boyfriend.",
    "414": "Ben watches the television. His face is depicted watching, and he continues to do so. The scene pulls back, revealing that Ben is in the Taft Hotel room, sitting on the bed and leaning against the headboard, with the television set on a stand facing him. The room is shown in a wide shot, lit only by the light from the television set. Mrs. Robinson walks into the frame, half dressed, passing between Ben and the television set and then goes out of frame. Ben continues to stare at the set as Mrs. Robinson appears again, passing back and forth twice more. Now fully dressed and carrying her purse, Mrs. Robinson passes through the room once more and, without looking at Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it, and exits, followed by the sound of the door closing. Ben gets up and moves to the windows of his bedroom in the Braddock house, opens the closed blinds to reveal bright sunlight outside, takes his bathing suit from the window sill, puts it on, moves to the bedroom door, opens it, and goes out. Mrs. Braddock is seen in the kitchen as Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool, and dives in. A raft floats in the center of the pool as Ben swims toward the length of the pool, surfaces, and pulls himself up on the raft, landing on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed. He stays on top of her for a moment, then turns and looks. Mr. Braddock is standing by the side of the pool with the sun behind him. Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock, followed by Mr. Robinson, and then Mrs. Robinson, all blotting out the sun. There is a long pause before the door opens and Mrs. Robinson enters, stopping to look at Ben. She raises her eyebrows as Ben thinks for a moment and looks at her. She pulls the covers down as he starts putting on his shirt. She sits on the edge of the bed, watching him, and shakes her head. There is another long pause as, at opposite sides of the room and without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes. Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box, with Mr. and Mrs. Braddock present. Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading. He slides off the raft and goes underwater, his hair streaming up and his eyes open. Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.",
    "418": "Eddie leaves the car parked at the gas station and heads for the bar. He enters Armstead's, a typical small town pool hall with a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Eddie and Charlie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon. Charlie rises from his barstool and joins Eddie, who is already at the table with a game in mid-progress. It's Eddie's shot. He downs his bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy shot. Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play. The bartender refills the glasses as soon as they are emptied. Two balls lay side by side on the table. Eddie peers at them, trying to figure his shot, blinking his eyes to focus better. Some of the onlookers seem skeptical. But Eddie pats the corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot. The ball banks in. He pounds his pal Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into a nearby chair. Stung, Eddie lies across the table and sets them up himself. They toss their money on the table, and Eddie shoots, but his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the table. The bartender cannot contain his staccato laughter. Eddie pauses, smiling. Sheepishly, the bartender replaces the balls in their original positions. Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting impatiently for the bartender to return with the money from the cash register. Then he downs his drink and quickly strokes out his shot, the ball banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar bills. The door of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds up his stuffed billfold for his pal, Charlie Burns, to see. He tosses it on the seat beside him and turns on the ignition. Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to fix the minute hand of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is empty. In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case. They stand before the swinging doors and look around. They saunter over to the cashier's cage. A sign on the brass bar reads NO GAMBLING ALLOWED. Eddie's arrival is noted by Big John and Preacher, a gambler and an addict, who hang out at Ames at all hours, waiting for action.",
    "42": "Everyone leaves the table to stand together at the rail watching. A woman rises on her tip-toes and kisses a man gently; his only reaction is to look at her. She kisses him again, and he responds a little better. She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her. The man hangs up a phone, swings his feet out of bed, puts on his slippers, and reaches for his robe. He shuffles sleepily to the door. Gideon comes out of his room and goes to the elevator. The elevator is there, and he opens the door and enters. Gideon closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The elevator starts down, and Gideon begins sneezing. Suddenly the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out. Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts moving down again. Gideon shakes his head and leans back, whistling again. The elevator comes to his floor and starts past it. Seeing this, Gideon looks confused. The night porter is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, with Gideon inside, keeps coming down, passing the lobby level and continuing toward the basement. The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. The night porter, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He presses the call button and the motor starts. An instant later the elevator appears and stops. The night porter opens the gate, pulls back the grill, and Gideon's body is seen sitting on the floor of the elevator, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut, except that Gideon has no strings to cut, only a throat cut from ear to ear. Close shot of Grandpierre, who is now doubly apoplectic. The camera pulls back to reveal Reggie and Adam, in their bathrobes. Reggie shrugs, and Reggie and Adam exchange looks. Grandpierre turns and leaves. Reggie and Adam start down the hall toward their own rooms. Adam, before hanging up, reflects on Tex's words, then looks behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts for Reggie's door. Reggie slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door. She undoes the bolt and opens the door. Adam enters. He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents. As Adam begins to examine the items one by one, he takes one out of the envelope and takes out his glasses before reading it. He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.",
    "422": "The Kentucky-bound train rolls down the track. Bert and Eddie finish their breakfast coffee in the dining room, while Sarah is in the washroom. Sarah makes her way down the aisle and joins them at the table, standing there with lips pursed, absorbing the insult. Bert gets up and reaches in his pocket for his billfold, and Eddie and Sarah just stare at him. They are at a table, sipping drinks, with Bert shuffling a deck of cards as he talks and Eddie listening intently like a schoolboy. Sarah sits apart, watching them both, and Eddie glances at Sarah who stares mutely at Bert. Eddie reaches across to light Bert's cigarette with the lighter Sarah gave him, while Bert's own lighter is on the table before him. Sarah sees it, picks it up, and sparks it into flame, and Bert goes back to shuffling his deck of cards. The lobby is thronged with gamblers and their women, sportsmen, tourists, all there for the Derby, with a jazz combo heard over the din of their voices. Eddie, looking excited, leads Sarah through the crowd, with Bert behind them, his face now shaded by dark glasses, following a bellhop to the main desk. He forces his way through some people to get to the desk and displays a neatly folded wad of money in his hand. Eddie laughs and moves toward the open door leading to the billiard rooms, his face glowing as he watches the flow of men moving in and out of the crowded room and hears the sound of clicking pool balls. He tucks his cue case under his arm and turns to Bert and Sarah who join him. Sarah turns toward the elevators, with Bert behind her, jiggling his keys, and the bellboy unlocks the door and Sarah enters. The doors to the other suite are open, and as she catches sight of Bert arranging things with the bellboy, she closes one door. The bellboy leaves as she moves to close the other, but Bert comes to the door, holding it open. He turns away and there is a long pause as he glares at her, then goes back into his room. She closes the door and leans against it. Screams are heard as the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs. Eddie cashes in a winning ticket and moves through the ornate racetrack bar to join Sarah at a table. Sarah has been drinking, and as she puts the money in her purse, Bert sits down. Findley is seen studying his program and holding a drink in his hand. He is tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men of forty or more sometimes have, and a cork-tipped cigarette dangles from his fingers.",
    "427": "Eddie takes his cue ball from the cashier's cage and heads for a table, mimicking the cashier wickedly as he passes Charlie. The two go to a table where Eddie selects a house cue and rolls it over the table top to test the roll, seeming pleased with it. He runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing it, then sweeps the cue ball into the corner pocket. Eddie takes some balls out of the return box and throws them on the table. Meanwhile, Big John and Preacher lean forward in their chairs to listen in, and Big John, with a stubbly cigar between his fingers, drifts over to their table. As Big John walks off, Eddie smiles at Charlie. At eight sharp, a departing customer holds the door for an incoming one: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual appearance, his clothes reflecting his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat, with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket. He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John, whose eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack, where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table. Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls. Fats and Eddie regard each other with amusement, sharing the private joke of pool hustlers. At his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table. Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case. The uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top, and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle. Fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails. Eddie stands and screws together his inlaid, ivory-pointed cue as Fats dries his hands. He and Fats eye one another. Henry helps Fats on with his coat. Fats carefully extends his palms so that Henry may sprinkle on some talcum powder. Sausage finishes racking. They are ready to start. Fats, immaculate in jacket and tie, tosses a wad of bills -- his stake money -- onto the table. Charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one. Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break.",
    "43": "He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE watches expectantly. The ultra-modern glass and concrete structure behind the Ecole Militaire. Several delegates identified by little plaques listing their respective nations, and their aides, sit around the large table. They are all wearing earphones. The Italian delegate is speaking. SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting the door after her. The British delegate rises to speak, continuing through the next scene. He hands her a paper. The one Grandpierre gave Reggie. It has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together. She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts speaking into her headset. From Reggie's and Adam's angle. All the delegates and their aides suddenly turn, surprised, and look at camera. From the delegate's angle. Inside the booth, Reggie and Adam can be seen heading for the door in a hurry. As the delegates look at one another, confused. By the locked gate. A quick succession of shots showing: Children's merry-go-round, Rond Point de Champs-Elysées with fountains playing, children's swings, Restaurant Laurent, balloon salesman. Adam stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as Reggie joins him. Adam starts off. Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up. They have collected quite a crowd. Into this area comes Tex, followed at a safe distance by Adam. Suddenly Tex stops. As he stares wide-eyed at something. Neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths. As he wheels to look at another booth. In another arrangement. He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another. Various flash shots of stamps of all sizes, shapes, and colors. As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into Adam. Tex is startled. They go off in opposite directions. As she hurries along a row of stalls, weaving around small groups of men standing together, showing each other stamps. Searching in another section of the market. But it isn't. Looking everywhere. Suddenly she sees something. Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest hidden by all the legs. She recognizes him from these fragments. She rushes to him, camera panning with her. Jean-Louis stands looking at some stamps. Sylvie grabs him. Reggie runs up and joins them. Jean-Louis looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember. Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. As Reggie comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to Adam's room and knocks. Bartholomew, his face lathered for a shaving, is on the phone.",
    "430": "Eddie walks over to the water cooler. Eddie's face is buried in his lap as Charlie massages his back. Behind him, in the washroom, is Fats, washing his face and hands. Charlie gets Eddie a bottle. Bert and Henry watch Eddie coldly. Eddie, drunken and exhausted, nods, looks up at Bert, grins maliciously, and takes a drink. Charlie starts to put away Eddie's cue stick. Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, looks at Eddie and then at Bert who nods. Henry helps Fats into the jacket with the carnation still in the lapel. Eddie grins at this. So does Bert. Fats opens his palms for the sprinkling of the talcum powder. Fats rubs his hands together, then takes out his cigarette case. Bert smiles in appreciation. Eddie grabs the leather case out of Charlie's hands. Eddie rises and confronts Fats almost scornfully. Eddie looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt. He and a smiling Bert exchange glances. Eddie moves to put on his jacket. Charlie confronts him. Eddie puts a bottle into the pocket of his jacket and returns to the table to screw together his cue stick. The sight of Fats makes him laugh again. Everyone stares at Eddie as he scratches his head, alone with his private joke. Eddie abruptly tosses his cue case away. A worried Charlie picks up the case and stands by mutely, watching Eddie disintegrate. Eddie leans over to shoot, then turns away, laughing loudly to himself. Fats watches him, soberly, patiently. A high angle. Fats is shooting. Eddie is asleep on a stool against a wall. Even Bert is dozing. The shots go in. Eddie bangs his head against the wall. He knocks over a bottle as he tries to get up off the stool. The noise startles him. Charlie watches sadly. Eddie gropes through his pockets and comes up with a few crumpled bills. Fats rises and tosses his cue on the table. Willie gives him the stake money. Fats confronts Eddie. Fats steps by Eddie and heads for the coat rack, slapping the stake money into Bert's hand as he goes by. Bert returns the money to his billfold, wordlessly. The blinds are drawn and the light strikes Eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles after Fats, holding his money out before him, pleading. He bangs against the corner of the table and falls onto the floor. Fats hears him go down and pauses, turning to see Charlie rush to Eddie's side. After a moment, Fats continues on toward the door. Charlie slaps Eddie's cheeks. Bert, Sausage, Willie, Preach step around the body on their way out. Eddie is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, the crashing of pool balls sounding in his head.",
    "432": "She looks at Eddie anxiously as she digs in her purse for the coins. She pays, collects her purse and book, and rises to leave. The public address system bleats over the noise of the crowded luncheonette. The waitress leans over and slaps Eddie on the shoulder. He wakes up with a cramped neck. The bar is nearly empty when Eddie comes in. As he looks around the bar he sees Sarah, alone at a back booth, sipping a highball. She seems amused by their encounter. He takes his drink and joins her at the booth. Sarah nods. There is a long pause as she tries to read his face. Eddie finishes his drink, rises, crosses to the bar, pays the bill, and returns to the booth. As they go out, Sarah stumbles, and he catches her by the arm. Eddie pauses a moment to register this as she limps off, then follows. Eddie goes into the liquor store. Sarah waits outside, stiff and uneasy. Then he comes out with the scotch and they walk off down the street together. They walk slowly, with their eyes pointed straight ahead. He tries to ignore her halting gait. They pass under the awning of the neighborhood's elegant Parisien restaurant. As she searches through her purse for her keys, he reaches out and puts his hand on her shoulder. She closes her eyes, then draws back against the door, fearful, like a threatened animal. He takes her head in his hands and kisses her. She responds but, as he holds her tighter, she starts to struggle. She pushes him away and shakes her head. They stand there for a long moment: she looks away; he looks down at the floor. Then Eddie takes the bag of scotch and places it underneath her arm. He leaves her there in the hall and walks off. A door opens. A hotel manager shows Eddie into a dingy, barely furnished room. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out some bills. Eddie removes his bags from the locker. The sight of the lunch counter reminds him of Sarah. But the lunchroom is empty; only the janitor is there, mopping up. Eddie picks up his bags and goes out. Eddie, on his way back to the hotel, stops at the same liquor store for a bottle. He enters his room, puts down his bags and the liquor, and sits on his rusted brass bed. From his pocket he pulls out the few crumpled bills he has left. He looks at the money, shakes his head disgustedly, and closes his eyes. It is a friendly, neighborhood bar for business people and cocktail drinkers. Eddie walks casually by the pool table and over to the bar.",
    "433": "He turns on his stool to watch the game, then goes back to his bottle of beer. Some bills drop on a ragged, beat-up pool table where two men, dressed in work clothes, stand around looking disgruntled. They go to the bar. Eddie sits at a table, smoking, waiting, with a paper bag containing whisky on the table. He mashes out his cigarette in the ashtray. Sarah, dressed in a dark suit, limps toward him and when he looks up, he sees Sarah standing nearby. She seems cold and suspicious as she limps toward the table and pauses to look at him. They stare at one another for a long moment. He gets up, puts his arm around her shoulder, and walks away with her. As they walk, she hesitantly puts an arm around his waist. Later, a hand reaches up to open the wooden shutters revealing Eddie, in his underclothes, on the bed. Sarah, in a robe, walks up and joins him in bed as they both peer out the window. She hands him her cigarette. He starts to put on his wristwatch, kisses her on the cheek, then kisses her again, this time on the lips. He reaches out and closes the shutters. Sarah emerges from a neighborhood grocery store loaded down with a Cheese Doodles carton full of food. A woman runs out of the store to give her a parcel she left behind. He pulls her schoolbooks out of the carton and takes her purse. She unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then goes to join Eddie by the window. Sarah takes a cigarette lighter out of her purse and hands it to Eddie. He takes it and she smiles, then she gets up and returns to the kitchenette. He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her. She cuts her hand opening a can. As he rummages through the closet for his bag he pulls out his leather cue case. They kiss. Someone knocks on the door and Sarah goes to open it. Eddie stays in the room, examining the lighter in his hand. Charlie enters the room, awkwardly, toying with the rim of his hat. There is a long silence, then Charlie sits. Sarah starts to make the drinks. Eddie leans up against the wall, listening. Sarah watches them both, curious, confused. Suddenly Eddie becomes tense. Sarah turns to fix the drink. Eddie signals her to stay where she is and moves forward, confronting Charlie. Eddie walks off. A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets up and moves toward the door. Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing.",
    "434": "Charlie puts on his hat and leaves. Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to Sarah. She pours it out, saying nothing, then hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye. She pours herself a very stiff drink as Eddie moves about restlessly. Sarah drinks her drink and, still drinking, turns to him. They embrace and kiss one another without putting down their glasses. The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case. Reaching for the bottle, Sarah abruptly lurches forward over her typewriter and knocks the bottle over. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag. Sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed, futilely attempting to dial a telephone. Eddie, in a clean shirt and pants, watches her. He sets the bottle down near the typewriter and notices the sheet of paper stuck in the typewriter's carriage. He bends down to read it. She falls back on the bed. Eddie pulls the paper out of the carriage and reads it. He thinks for a moment, then angrily crumples the paper in his hands and throws it at her. Eddie walks off. Eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes. Eddie turns and slaps her on the cheek. He reaches for his jacket. Eddie pushes through the glass doors to the front room of Johnny's bar. He looks around at the unused pool tables, then goes to the bar. A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins him at the bar. The man looks to the bartender for his answer. Eddie takes his beer to the back room. The poker game is in progress. Four men are playing. One of them is Bert Gordon. His glass of milk is beside him on the table. He takes note of Eddie's presence with a quick dart of his eyes. Eddie takes a seat next to Bert. As the cards are dealt Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.",
    "438": "The camera slowly pans up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem of three balls outside a hock shop, showing the time as twenty minutes to one, then later, five minutes to four. Inside a bar, Nat and a few customers listen to race results on a little radio. Don enters, drenched in sweat and breathing heavily, and sets a typewriter on the bar. Nat shoves a drink towards Don, who shakily drinks it and asks for another. Don then takes the typewriter and leaves, dragging himself up the street towards home. He stops upon seeing a wooden Indian statue outside an antique shop. Entering a rundown Third Avenue house, Don struggles up the stairs, checks the name tags by the doorbells, and rings one persistently. Gloria answers, wearing a dressing gown and slippers, her hair disheveled and eyes angry. She retrieves a wallet and gives Don five dollars. He takes it, kisses her hand, and leaves with the typewriter. Gloria watches him go. Later, Don, now in flannel pajamas, is seen by a terrified man who drifts away, and a male nurse approaches with a pad and pencil. Bim watches Don with a grin as he navigates a swinging glass door, beyond which are benches and wheelchairs along the walls.",
    "44": "She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then hurries to the door. As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator, she presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to the stairs and starts down, between the landings. The stairs curve around the open elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet. REGGIE starts running downstairs. ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the cage down. As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind her. As REGGIE continues to run, between the first landing and the lobby, REGGIE running, the elevator following. A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs to it. ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls. The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors. REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, an arrow for each. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot pursuit. REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps. Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM. He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. They stare at each other for a moment. Then the bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back through the exit behind him. The approaching train can be heard. As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop. The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out. ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. From ADAM'S P.O.V. Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats. It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, looking for some sign of REGGIE. As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no sign of REGGIE. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's hand reaching up to dial a number.",
    "442": "Don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen. Don is just coming from it. He walks down the street about ten steps when Helen comes up to him. Don disregards her, tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and blocks his way. He goes on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop. The pawn broker has put Helen's coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact. On it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on which Don is writing. But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn't I? Goodbye. He puts down the pen, gets up, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer and loads the gun. As he has been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp. Don is seated at the desk. With a last look at the room, he walks into the bathroom. Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror, the gun in his hand. He notices the unbuttoned points of his collar and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, there is a sound from outside. Startled, Don puts the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door is being opened. She looks around wildly. She is breathing hard from her race to get there. There is rain on her hair and her face, and her dress is wet. Don comes from the bathroom. Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too. She stands looking about. He steps to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. Helen, looking around desperately, sees something reflected in the shaving mirror: THE GUN IN THE WASH BOWL. Before she can step toward it, Don is back with the scarf. Helen goes to the umbrella stand, takes out the bottle. She puts down the raincoat and the scarf and goes to the kitchen for a glass. He picks up the raincoat and the scarf. He bends down for a kiss. Helen stands looking at him. Helen holds out the glass. She turns and runs into the bathroom and picks up the gun. Don follows her. Helen holds it behind her. He half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. A wave of weakness overcomes him and he sags against the door. Don goes to the door and opens it.",
    "444": "Don freezes, his eyes turning towards the door, horrified. He rises slowly from the couch, takes a few steps towards the entrance door. At the door stands Mrs. Foley, a middle-aged charwoman with a large utility bag over her arm. He stands galvanized. He goes to the kitchenette. On the counter under the cupboards stands the sugar bowl. Don lifts the lid. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill. Don takes it out, goes into the entrance hall and even though Mrs. Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars behind his back. She closes the door, takes the key and starts down the stairs. He looks at it, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, then, with an afterthought, goes into the living room. The camera moves slowly toward them so that only about eight bottles fill the screen and we can see, between them, the shop, its window on Third Avenue, its entrance door. The camera is behind the rack of liquor in a store on Third Avenue. Through the glass door we see Don Birnam hurrying up. He peers into the shop to make sure there are no other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands breathing heavily. He gives a quick glance in each direction, to see that he's not observed. A salesman rises in the foreground, his back to the camera. Don points to two bottles in the foreground. The salesman has taken two bottles from the rack in the foreground and put them on the counter. Don gives him the money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold. The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards the cash register. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the bag. The salesman hands him his change. It is a little short and the necks of the bottles protrude. Don pockets it. Don takes the package and walks past the newcomer towards the door, hiding it from him gracefully, like a football in a sneak play. Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag. Don stops. In front of it is a fruit stand. Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag, to camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples. The lady with the dog sees him. He wants to start down the street but about twenty-five feet away stand two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog on a leash.",
    "446": "It is dusk and the electric lights are on. Suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes. The bar is silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs and ham. Nat brings over the plate of ham and eggs and pours a jiggerful. Don downs it. Nat fills it and then sits down to his ham and eggs. He drinks his jiggerful and taps the glass on the bar. From the street enters Gloria, wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, another foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows. He pours another drink. A man has entered the bar, a round-faced, middle-aged man with pince-nez. With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria. He takes a couple of steps towards the door, turns, and there is a Guide of New York sticking from his pocket. He walks out, bewildered. He downs the jigger of rye. Nat does break down and pours a drink. He takes off his hat and shakes the rain from it, then peels off his raincoat. They are wearing raincoats, carrying umbrellas. He is alone and wears a bowler and a straight raincoat. A crowd of people is streaming into the building. It is doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel. With a quick gesture he transfers the bottle to the pocket of the raincoat, rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes around a precious infant. In the side pocket of his suit is a pint of liquor. Among the crowd is Don Birnam. Don hands his coat to an attendant. His eyes linger on its pocket with a certain tenderness, then he turns and starts towards the door of the auditorium. Seeing an opening in the line at the cloak room counter, he steps into it. Don sits about five seats from the aisle. He sits between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, and a middle-aged man and wife. He is glancing through the program as the curtain rises, changing the light on our group. Don looks up. Thirst in his eyes, he looks away from the stage, tries to concentrate on the ceiling of the Metropolitan. Powdered footmen are pouring wine into the glasses of the over-vivacious guests. Alfred and Violetta are batting the drinking song back and forth, as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands slowly swaying, echoing each couplet. As he looks at the stage, his imagination is working at top speed. The first drops of sweat are gathering on his forehead. He takes the handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his forehead. The swaying echelon of choristers slowly dissolves to a row of raincoats, exactly like the one Don wore. They hang from hangers and sway slowly to Verdi's rhythm. His eyes glued to what he sees on the stage.",
    "45": "Reggie sits on the floor of the booth, dialing. An operator speaks into a headset. A shot of the phone booth reveals Reggie's head peeking cautiously over the bottom of the window from inside. Through the glass, Adam can be seen leaving the Sortie area. Reggie carefully opens the door and comes out, then goes to the corner and looks around it. As Adam walks away from the camera, down the platform, the camera pans to Reggie peeking around the corner. She looks back once more at Adam, then makes up her mind and starts running towards the exit as the bell rings announcing the next train. He turns to look and sees Reggie, which hits her hard and she stops, in alarm. Reggie stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to. She looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do, then stops in alarm. Looking for some way out, Adam moves out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second. He aims carefully and fires, the bullet creases it, and the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. He wheels, with Carson in the background, who fires at him. Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot. Seeing Carson otherwise occupied, Reggie turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her. Carson, seeing Reggie running to the door, turns and fires at her but is too late—she is safely inside. Carson looks quickly back toward Adam, then takes off after Reggie. He runs to it, tries the door and enters. As Carson enters the auditorium and looks around, the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre—boxes, seats, stage, but there is no sign of Reggie. As Carson walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats, Adam appears moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces which fill the room. As Carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for Reggie, at mid-stage, the camera pans down to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified Reggie, holding her breath as she watches him. As Carson moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board and throws on all the switches, the stage is bathed in light. He returns to the stage.",
    "450": "Behind the glass lies the folder of matches, which attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass to one side. The waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest and his stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of Don, then hurries on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check over and puts his hand in his pocket, pulling out what cash he has—only two one-dollar bills and some small change. At that moment the waiter returns, expecting to be paid. Taking the check, the waiter leaves. Next to him, the couple is cooing away like Spring, but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag. There must be some money in that bag. The man is whispering something into the girl's ear, and she is shaking her head. Don looks around the room, his plan forming. As though inadvertently, he drops his hand on the bench beside the bag. It's a handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. M. The bag moves very close to his coat. Don pulls the purse imperceptibly closer to himself. Now, switching his cigarette, Don crosses his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his coat. He pulls it to his armpit and holds it there, tucked close to his ribs. Very calmly Don smokes his cigarette, a great gentleman. The waiter comes back with the drink. Guests and waiters are passing by. He points to a door at the other end of the room. There is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the washroom. The waiter pulls the table away for him. Don starts to rise. It's a two-wash-basin affair, with a colored attendant who, as Don enters, is brushing a customer. Don carries the bag under his open coat by the pressure of his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, so that the whole thing looks fairly natural. As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. He puts down the cake of soap, pulls out the bag, opens it. There, between a compact, lipstick and keys, are some bills. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations. He can't help smiling at the idea which flashes into his mind. He takes one of the carnations, puts it into the purse, closes the purse and thrusts it back under his coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both hands into the water.",
    "451": "The Kid's Grandfather, kind of rumpled but with bright eyes, bursts into the room. He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as he immediately goes to The Kid, pinching his cheek. The Mother ignores this, beats a retreat, and she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then The Kid does his best to smile, suddenly passionate. The Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed and begins reading a story. The monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English countryside. Buttercup, in her late teens, doesn't care much about clothes and hates brushing her long hair. She is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, Westley, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup and maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her as she walks away. Westley is outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large buckets near him, leaves, but his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns—he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him. Westley enters with an armload of firewood, gets it, hands it to her. They are standing very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes. Westley and Buttercup are outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset, locked in a passionate kiss. They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace. He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go. Buttercup stares out the window of her room. Hold on her face, perfect and perfectly sad. The main courtyard of Florin is replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace. Prince Humperdinck, a man of incredible power and bearing, stands in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others stand behind him: an old couple with crowns, the aging King and Queen, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is Count Rugen. A giant staircase leads to the crowd and as a figure just begins to become visible. The crowd, as they see the figure, and if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath. The staircase, as the figure appears in the archway. And she resplendent. She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. The crowd, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.",
    "454": "The scene freezes with Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence. The Kid is now half sitting, stronger than before. On these words, Buttercup emerges as seen previously. The crowd suddenly kneels in waves of silent people, all of them down. Buttercup is touched but appears stunned. She advances on Buttercup, who becomes increasingly panicked. Buttercup wakes from her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. She frantically grabs a robe and starts to run, then bursts into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands nearby, just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk, and she nods. Humperdinck and Rugen walk into a grove of unusually heavily knotted trees, moving deeper in. Rugen searches around and smiles, hurrying down the stairs as a tree slides back into place. He drags Westley up alongside a contraption with levers, wheels, and wires. Westley has suction cups on his head, temple, heart, hands, and feet. He says nothing, keeping control of himself. Rugen opens a floodgate, pouring water down a chute, turning a wheel that activates the machine. Westley lies on a table, his desperation almost breaking the thick metal chains. The machine keeps operating. Rugen switches it off, picks up a large notebook and pen, and sits in a chair. Westley is in deep anguish, crying helplessly. Rugen watches the tears and starts to write in his quarters, swamped with piles of papers. Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man, appears in the doorway, entering. The Prince and Yellin turn to her in the doorway as she glides out. A lot of hollering occurs as thieves are rounded up by the Brute Squad, a large group of large men. Yellin stands on a wagon amidst the scuffling. His wagon starts moving. Inigo, drunk, sprawls in front of a hovel with a bottle of brandy and his six-fingered sword. He looks dreadful, unshaven, puffy-eyed, and gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back and compares it to his own smaller hand. As the Assistant Brute is about to club Inigo, Fezzik delivers a stupendous punch.",
    "46": "He stoops to read it then, satisfied, recovers the foot and moves to the other end to uncover the head as the sheet starts to lift. She closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again and nods; she nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the shot and nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT. The camera suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. A close shot shows a desk drawer from above as it is pulled open, revealing a photograph of Charles Lampert lying face up. Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk and REGGIE sitting across from him, the office is as bare as most policemen's offices. She starts to rummage through her bag but pulls a package of nuts out instead. She begins separating the shells with her thumbnail and eating the nuts, depositing the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an instant, sighs, puts down his pencil, and pushes a button on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth, then rips it out and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket and begins to take items out, placing them on the desk, identifying each one as he does. He hands her a letter and watches her closely as she reads it, then slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her. He starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks and reaches into the desk drawer to pull out a passport which he hands to her. The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man – the man seen in GRANDPIERRE's photo. He hands her another passport with an American cover and gives her two more passports, one at a time. His eyes are still lowered. The camera pans down to feature his hands – he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. The front door of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in, outlining the short, heavy-set figure of a man against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird, then walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel as he watches GIDEON and as she watches him. GIDEON arrives at the coffin.",
    "465": "Then suddenly, FEZZIK jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter. FEZZIK charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe. Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of FEZZIK's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on. Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and FEZZIK starts to slowly collapse. And there isn't much breath coming. The Man In Black holds his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But there is just no air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies still. The Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's heart. The Man In Black stands. And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it and as he dashes off up along the mountain path. Prince Humperdinck slips his boot into a foot print in the sand. Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers. And he gallops off. THE MAN IN BLACK, cresting the peak of the mountain.",
    "47": "He stops and looks down at LAMPERT's body for a moment, then suddenly sneezes six times in rapid succession. He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it, and swallows it dry. He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit, but stops when he comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, then turns to sit somewhere else. The sound of the door opening interrupts them again, causing them to turn and look. A man in a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie, and bright yellow flower in his lapel is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness, with a Bull Durham tag hanging from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string. He starts down the aisle towards the bier, his unsteady gait noticeable, and turns to look at the others present—GRANDPIERRE, GIDEON, REGGIE, and SYLVIE—all staring at him as he arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself, then takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box. SYLVIE points to REGGIE, and unruffled, he starts over, addressing REGGIE this time. She pulls out the letter and starts to read it; it bears the Great Seal as a letterhead, and SYLVIE reads over REGGIE's shoulder.The elevator door closes on them, and REGGIE reacts to this, starting down the hall and finally stopping at the door. The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, and notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. BARTHOLOMEW, a pale grey-haired man who looks older than his forty-odd years, sickly, pallid, and consumptive-looking, comes to the door and looks in. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose, causing him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. A small cubicle, there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk, along with a can of lighter fluid standing open and a crumpled hankie beside it. He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie, looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, decides against using it, then sticks it in his pocket.",
    "473": "Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation. Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains. CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination. Suddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score. He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room. Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure. At the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform. Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said. He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg. A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig. The Salesman puts the second wig on his head. Mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror. He giggles. He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him. It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten and Salieri. The room contains several gilded chairs dotted about, and a forte-piano. All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty. He produces a paper. The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it. He plays a wrong note. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.",
    "474": "Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps him out. Von Strack and Bonno nod, while Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm. Mozart stops short with a little giggle, then giggles again. Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly, but the Italian faction, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno, laugh discreetly. There is an embarrassed pause before Bonno giggles in nervous amusement. Joseph is clearly pleased and nods, having wanted this result all the time. Mozart becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand and goes to the forte-piano, seating himself. The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy, then plays it again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously. All the courtiers look at Salieri. Mozart plays another phrase, then another, gradually altering the music into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity while Salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. Mozart finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph, and grins. The olivewood cross is seen, and Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. The singer's face dissolves, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and the performance is on. The house is full. Watching the performance, conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra, are Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box. In another box is an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable Madame Weber and her three daughters, Constanze, Josefa and Sophie. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen. Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with happy excitement and bows frantically, over-excited. She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor. She stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.",
    "476": "He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, perplexed, then stops and kisses his hand, overjoyed. He raises her and clasps her to him clumsily. They stare at one another, Constanze in total disbelief. He glares at her. Meanwhile, Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross, then stirs himself as a servant appears. She looks at him inquiringly and drops the portfolio, pages of music pouring out. Constanze starts to undress to its grand and weighty sound, watched by the horrified Salieri. He opens his mouth in distress. The candle flickers over her as she prepares for his embrace. A close-up shows the fireplace, in it the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning. Mozart chuckles delightedly as Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking. Suddenly, there is hysterical barking and howling, the hall full of at least five dogs jumping and dashing about, making a terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and plumed hat, has arrived to teach at Michael Schlumberg's house. Schlumberg, bluff and friendly, greets Mozart amidst the leaping and barking animals. Suddenly the girl rises, and Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands, and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls loudly, startling Mozart who stops and then starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. He bows to them and leaves the room. Both men embrace in a cramped, untidy room filled with empty wine bottles, musical instruments, books, and abandoned plates of food. Mozart clasps his father Leopold's arms. Leopold is aging, travel-stained, and not in perfect health. He carries the bag across the room. Constanze lies in bed, sitting up startled as he opens the door. She looks ill and tired, staring at Leopold who stares back and then closes the door. He picks up some pages of manuscript. Laughingly, bystanders take it up, especially the children. As Leopold glares furiously, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. All the bystanders are watching. Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. Again, Mozart is seen at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.",
    "479": "Mary looks at Sam's smile, responds by pulling him to her, and kisses him. Without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, searches for her shoes with her toes, finds them, and slips her feet in. She then pulls away and sits up. Rising, she goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, and begins putting them on, not looking at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but cheery. They continue dressing and combing their hair. Mary stares at Sam, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, and speaks with simple sincerity. He moves away, his good humor crushed by his pain and problems. He looks at her, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, and then stares out the window at the wide sky. Mary goes out quickly, closing the door behind her, as Sam stares down at his shoeless feet. Mary enters a small, moderately successful office off the main street. She gets out of a cab, pays the driver, crosses the pavement to the office door, enters, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, and looks over at Caroline, a teenage girl. Caroline rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand, but is distracted by the sound of the door opening. Mr. Lowery and his oil-lease client, Tom Cassidy, enter the office. Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, trying to lead Cassidy toward the private office. Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, sits on the desktop, and smiles at Mary. Mary glances at him but cannot smile or make a remark, continuing to sort out deed copies, trying to ignore Cassidy's closeness. He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, and speaks to Mary meaningfully. Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary, then starts quickly away when Cassidy looks like he is going to pull him bodily into the office. When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle and smiles at it. Mary puts one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline. She puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, and starts to open the door.",
    "480": "They pause and Norman pauses. Norman walks past Sam, giving him a quick, disapproving glance, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time. Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the book as Sam signs in. When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, looks at him. Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his pocket. Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks up the key, quickly, starts out. Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door. Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down the porch. Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises. He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, back to Lila. Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out. Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand. Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin One. They pause before the door of Cabin One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, calls in. Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet away. She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, stops her. Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and Himself to pass through. ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door. Sam starts into the office. She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house.",
    "484": "A woman passes the window, pauses, and peers out. She is seen in clear silhouette before quickly going away from the window. Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention. She dashes out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, and begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a young man opens the front door of the house, pauses, and starts down the path. Mary leaves her car and starts a dash for the shelter of the porch. Seeing that Mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached it. He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand, then back to her. He gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the office. The young man follows Mary in and closes the door. He is Norman Bates, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-spoken and hesitant. He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration book. Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the registration book, picks up the pen, and is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes the name Marie Samuels. He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a remaining key on the board. He goes to the door and opens it. The rain has slowed down considerably. Mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to her car, gets in, and drives it to the parking space in front of Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch and waits before the door of Cabin One. Norman gets out of the car, with a suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches on a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her. Norman places the suitcase on the bed, goes to the window, and opens it. Mary closes the door, goes to the suitcase, opens it, and starts to take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it, almost with regret, contemplates hiding it, decides to, and starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks about, at the closet, the drawers, etc., and realizes all such places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again, and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading.",
    "485": "Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. The camera follows her to the window, and once there, we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room. Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room. Mary turns, looks out the window. We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray. Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch. Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. She begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing in the doorway. As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone. Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread. Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs. Mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness. The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish. She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night. He goes into the office and looks at the book. He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. Norman turns his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.",
    "487": "A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of Mary's throat. A hand enters the shot, holding an enormous bread knife. Brief gulps of screaming are heard, then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. Above the shower-bar, the bathroom door opens again and after a moment, the sound of the front door slamming is heard. Mary is lying half in, half out of the tub, her head tumbled over and touching the floor, her hair wet, one eye wide open, and one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Many small threads of blood run down the side of the tub, thick and dark along the porcelain. The camera follows away from the body, traveling slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As the camera approaches the bed, the folded newspaper Mary placed on the bedside table is seen. The camera moves away over to the window and looks up to the house. The sound of Norman's fearful, shocked voice is heard coming from within the house. She stops, anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls. Bob gets the message and goes out through the back way. Sam goes closer to Lila, speaking with soft seriousness. Arbogast studies it, then speaks. He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, puts it on the counter, opens the door, and goes out into the street. Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in. Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, and studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door. He waits a moment, then opens the closet, starts counting out sheets and pillowcases, keeping his back to Arbogast. Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talking as he crosses to Norman. Norman glances briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillowcases off the shelf, and holds them close, almost protectively. He goes to the wall, flips a light switch. He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely. Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks dutifully at it. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts to talk to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful. Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch.",
    "490": "Malcolm points to the huge framed certificate propped up on a dining room chair. It's printed on aged parchment-type paper, and the frame is a polished mahogany. He slips on the sweatshirt. Her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate. She leans forward in her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to tickle her. Anna turns to Malcolm. He smiles. Anna takes his hands and holds them steady. Anna lets go of his hands. Anna's eyes are emotional. Anna leans towards him. They hold each other tight. Their sweet laughter fills the house. Two giggling shadows appear in the bedroom doorway. They try to turn on the light. The stranger slowly looks up for the first time. His eyes lock on Malcolm. The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway. Malcolm stumbles back onto the edge of the bed. Anna sees the stranger for the first time. Her face drains of color. The stranger looks at Malcolm. He half grins. Anna's expression instantly changes. The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm. Malcolm stops all movement. Malcolm stands. Tears fall down the stranger's face. Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words. Vincent Gray stares with surprise through his tears. Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters. Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm. Vincent is fully crying now. Vincent turns to the sink. His hand goes in. He turns around and raises a gun at Malcolm. He fires. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed. Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. Handwritten notes fill every line. He glances through the page. Words and phrases are circled throughout the file. Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street. He gazes blankly at the brownstones. A door opens. Malcolm is brought out of his trance. Cole Sear steps out his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him. His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side. Cole carefully locks the door behind him. The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of very large glasses. They look comical on him. Malcolm rises to his feet. When he looks up, Cole is gone. Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy. Cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. He stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too. Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk. He comes to a hard stop at a street intersection. Cole sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a building.",
    "491": "After a second, Mr. Cunningham enters and finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a female teacher kneels next to him, making final adjustments. Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham, who looks around the room and then directly at Cole. The female teacher looks to Cole and nods. The group of villagers on the stage laugh and mock. Tommy Tammisimo, dressed in a mismatched costume, hops around, clearly embarrassed. He smiles a true friend's smile. Cole hesitates, taking a moment before he steps forward, up to the stone. He places his hand around the handle and begins to pull. The sword starts to come out, and Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head. Merlin and everyone on stage bows. Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spotlight for the first time. The villagers rise and rush to Cole, scooping him up and carrying him around the stage in celebration. Cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up. They slowly sag and then collapse. All the students laugh as they try to untangle themselves. Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable among a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage. The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass window. Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby as Cole walks back and forth in front of him, still holding the sword from the play. Cole glances at Malcolm, who exhales very slowly as he gets up and walks down the stairs to the entrance. Lynn glances over to Cole, who sits in his seat silently. The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill. Cole takes a long time, and Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights, looking over slowly and eyeing Cole. Lynn becomes upset and nods with grave understanding as Cole watches her. Lynn's eyes move to Cole, and he gazes at her intense expression, smiling a tiny smile. Lynn glances down, drowning in her thoughts, and looks up sharply, becoming still with an unreadable face. Her eyes lock on Cole's, and she brings her hands to her mouth, beginning to cry. She covers her face with her hands as the tears roll out through her fingers, looking at her son and barely getting the words out. Cole moves closer to Lynn, and she cradles him in her arms. Mother and son hold each other tight. Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home and enters the living room, smiling at what he sees.",
    "494": "Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow, then chuckles. Cole's face turns cement grey as Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering. Cole glances up, sees all the eyes on him, and looks at the teacher who is still staring. Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and instantly stops smiling, his face becoming still. The class falls into stunned silence. Mr. Cunningham takes an involuntary step towards Cole's desk and moves closer to him. Cole covers his eyes with his hands, his mouth visible underneath. He stares for a second, then lowers his head. Malcolm sits and thinks, taking in the sad vision of Cole. Cole's face softens a bit, and he turns from the windows to look at Malcolm. Malcolm shakes his hand in circles, and Cole watches carefully. Malcolm taps his pocket but doesn't open it, then opens his right hand to reveal the penny sitting quietly in the center of his palm. Cole looks at the penny, then up to Malcolm's face, and cracks a smile. He smiles and holds out his hand, his fingers opening to reveal the penny. Bobby stares as Cole loses his smile. Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other, and Cole gives the boy his penny, gazing at Bobby. Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen, staring at the crawl space closet. Tommy grabs Darren and nudges him to move down the hall. Cole breaks from his trance as Tommy and Darren walk up. It happens too quick for Cole to react. Darren and Tommy shove Cole backwards into the darkness of the crawl space and slam the door closed. They crack smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door. The banging goes on for a few seconds and then it just stops. Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door, backing away as Cole screams in terror at the top of his lungs, his body slamming against the wood. The two boys are statues as Cole's blood-chilling yells fill the air. Footsteps spike the air as children and mothers come running down the hall. Lynn is one of them. Malcolm is affected by his client and stares at the tired child sitting before him in the hospital bed. He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed. Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches him with unwavering attention. Malcolm smiles. Cole takes an eternal pause. Malcolm just gazes quietly, very still, and stares at Cole.",
    "497": "Cole closes his eyes and holds his mom tight. They are in an antique store filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks. Anna stands with a young couple, all three leaning over and peering into a glass cabinet. An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand. The young woman looks at her beau, then places the ring in their hands. She looks at Anna with great intrigue. The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance, and together they gaze at Anna silently before looking down at the ring. Anna moves to the back desk where Sean comes out carrying an antique bench, which he places down and sits on. Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a birthday present sits on his tabletop. Sean looks at her. Meanwhile, Malcolm looks up sharply as Cole starts crying. There is a long pause as they both stare, Cole searching for the answer in Malcolm's eyes. Cole pushes something across the table. Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes. Later, Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement, leaning his head back against the chair and staring into the shadows. His eyes scan the room and stop on a box marked with a label. A tape slides into the tape player on his desk. Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player. His fingers move to the volume dial and he turns it way up, filling the basement with static noise. Cole holds up his plastic rifleman and Malcolm's eyes show he understands now. They stand silently in the center aisle at the back of the church, Cole looking nervous. Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to Cole. Malcolm moves around the corner on his street, his mind surging with thoughts. He glances up, his steps slowing to a complete stop as he sees Sean coming out of the front door of his house. Malcolm's face turns to stone as he watches Sean come down the front stairs and start across the street. Malcolm moves towards Sean fast, but Sean reaches his car and enters it, pulling away into traffic almost hitting another car. Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street, then turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and overwhelming pain erupting in his eyes. Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent, stumbling out. A table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room.",
    "500": "Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. She goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister. Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. He is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair. Thelma watches approvingly. He's finally ready. He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand. They both hang up. Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition. Going into the suitcase are bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip. Thelma is standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something. The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog. It's really frilly. The suitcase is perfectly ordered, everything neatly folded and orderly. Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown. She could be packing for camp. Louise's room is as orderly as the suitcase. Everything matches. She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks. She decides not to and closes the suitcase. She goes to the phone, picks it up, and dials. They load everything into the car. The trunk barely closes. They get into the car and pull out of the driveway. As they drive down the street, Thelma lets out a long howl. She is laughing and sticks her arms straight up in the air. They are driving down the interstate. Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. Louise shrieks at the sight of it. Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand. She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. They are speeding off down the highway with the radio blaring. Louise puts in a tape of wild R&B music. They are both silent for a minute. After a pause, Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.",
    "502": "She picks up the check and looks at it. Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot and is trying to kiss her. He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. Harlan is pushing himself on her, and she is beginning to push him away harder. Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck. He has her ass in his hands and is beginning to hump her. She is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless. He looks mean and dangerous. He lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her. He holds both of her arms with one hand. With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up. Thelma is still struggling, and there are tears running down her face. There is a tight shot of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of Harlan's neck. Louise's thumb pulls back the hammer. Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts out, pulling her dress down. Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face. His pants are undone in the front. She is still backing away with the gun raised. Thelma is inching away as well. Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second. Then she turns and walks away. Thelma does, too. Louise stops in her tracks. Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun and fires a bullet into his face. The car behind him is splattered with blood. Thelma and Louise are both silent. Louise lowers the gun. Thelma runs to get the car. Thelma comes careening up in reverse. Louise hops in and Thelma peels out, spraying gravel. As they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, we hear music blaring from the nightclub. They hit the main road with tires squealing. Thelma starts to cry quietly. Thelma pulls off to the side of the road. Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car. She stops when she gets to the back of the car, and she is sick. Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side. Louise gets in the driver's side. Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly. Louise studies Thelma's face. Louise looks at Thelma for a long time. Police cars are parked around. The activity has died down. In the back of a police car sits the Waitress with the door open. A detective in a suit leans over the car door with his notepad. Louise did not realize she was doing it.",
    "503": "Louise slams the closet door, causing Thelma to jump. They are silent for a moment, then Thelma stares down the road and puts her finger down on the receiver as Louise hangs up the phone and walks away towards the front of the store. Thelma comes out of the front of the store, and they look at each other. Thelma walks around to the side of the building to the phone, while Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. Darryl is mad but still watching the game, as Thelma tries not to cry and be strong. Neither says anything for a moment, then Thelma hangs up on him, has tears running down her face, and storms back to the car, watching the ground. She makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone she did not see, knocking both back a few steps. She notices his blue eyes and wants him to come, but he starts to walk away from the car. Louise comes out of the store, sees Thelma talking to the guy, stops for a moment, then continues toward the car with an expressionless face. The Hitchhiker nods and starts walking towards the road. Thelma decides not to confront Louise about the guy, who seems nice. Louise lowers the top, backs the car out, and they watch him walk away. Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road, passing the Hitchhiker who smiles and waves. They drive down the road as the smile fades from the Hitchhiker's face and Thelma looks sulky. Hal goes over a list of every registered green T-Bird in the state, seeing the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scroll past. They are clear of the town, and Thelma won't let something drop. Louise looks shaken up, keeps her eyes on the road, and holds the steering wheel tightly. She reaches over and locks her door. Darryl's face is shown in an extreme closeup, and J.D. looks down the road. Louise sees a highway patrol car coming towards them and glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them.",
    "505": "Darryl's face is in a state of shock. Hal, Max, and others are looking intently at the screen. Thelma is seen ordering a cashier to fill her purse with money. As he does, she adds beef jerky from the display, while pointing a gun at him. Thelma and Louise are driving, with Louise noting the speedometer touching 80 mph and easing off the gas, looking nervous. Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a small bottle of Wild Turkey. As they pull next to a truck, the driver smiles and waves at them. They smile and wave back, but the driver flicks his tongue at them. Louise screams and they both pause. As the sun sets, the T-Bird drives into the vast desert. Darryl is sitting in the hallway as two officers lead J.D. down the hall, followed by Hal, Max, and other plainclothes officers. Hal thinks, then looks to Max, who agrees and opens the door for the others to leave. Hal and J.D. sit across from each other. J.D. shifts in his chair. Hal opens the door and Max and the others return. The TV is on and the place is a mess. Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops act as the phone rings, but Thelma hangs up. Everyone is disappointed, looking at Darryl like he's an idiot. Thelma and Louise stare at each other intently. Louise steps up to the phone and everyone acts again. Darryl fumbles with the phone but gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it under control. Louise hangs up the phone. Everyone tries to see if the call was traced. Darryl is back in his recliner, still in shock. Louise is stomping back to the car with Thelma following. A moving van pulls in and parks in the background. Louise stops, faces Thelma, yanks open her car door, gets in, slams the door, and fires up the engine.",
    "51": "Reggie takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter, wincing, and puts it into her mouth. He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. She hands over the newer one to Bartholomew, who sadly examines its mutilated end while Reggie returns to the first cigarette. The waiter returns with the coffee and onion soup. Dyle leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, Reggie comes cautiously from the hotel. First comes Dyle, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the Sandwich-Man and Reggie. A moment later, Dyle passes a Girl painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work. Reggie, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by Dyle, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to Dyle. It is already occupied by a middle-aged Tourist, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at Reggie and she stares back. He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. Reggie turns to look at Dyle. He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. The Tourist has finally found the courage to speak. As he opens his mouth to make a sound, Reggie, her eyes on Dyle, rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused Tourist with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her. Reggie following Dyle. Now we see that the Tourist, in turn, is following her. She continues after Dyle. The Tourist hesitates, then continues after her. He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He turns back in Reggie's direction. Realizing she has to do something before Dyle spots her, she turns and takes the Tourist's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe. She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as she starts after Dyle again. Dyle has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away. Reggie hurries across the street, hailing a taxi. Dyle enters. Dyle walks to one of several windows. A sign over it reading. Reggie comes down the stairs. Suddenly she stops. A confused look on her face. As his turn comes, he addresses the Clerk. Watching. The Clerk takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts through it. Dyle stops in his tracks, pondering what to do. Camera Dollies across an empty cabin to discover Reggie in the third one, on the phone.",
    "511": "Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other, then picks up the mail on the floor and jams the keys into the lock, opening the door. He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms. The place looks a mess, like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking. He freezes, looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco, which hits the floor with a pop. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus, and they look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky. Banky blinks, then shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden saunters up and sits beside him. Holden follows Banky's gaze, and Banky shoots him a glare before walking away. Holden shakes his head. Meanwhile, at an all-girl gathering, Tory, Nica, Dalia, and Jane help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. Tory letters a page, Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork, and Dalia drinks wine. Alyssa buries her face, giggling, and they all cackle. Alyssa tries to laugh with them, but Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously, and all four girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified. Later, Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them, and she smokes. Holden looks down at that book, shakes his head at Banky, and flips it open to reveal Alyssa's Senior year photo. Cut to Cohee Lundon in the parking lot of Food City, addressing the camera. Back in the office, Holden stares at Banky, grabs him, and pins him against the wall, then releases him, and Banky brushes himself off. Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs, and a young Black kid approaches Hooper, holding a comic book, then leaves, and Hooper slips back into his real voice. On the ice, the players skid into the corner, and the crowd around Alyssa and Holden goes wild. Player One checks Player Two into the boards, hard, and Alyssa's into the game. Player Two scrambles to his feet and throws down his gloves, pulls Player One's helmet off, and punches him in the face. Player Two yanks at Player One's jersey and gut punches him, and Player One staggers a bit, then quickly rights his jersey and lunges at Player Two, landing a barrage of his own punches, while Holden's face is really sour looking. As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face, and locks lips with him, big time. He drops his keys and embraces her, and there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing.",
    "514": "Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified. He is seen leaving the hospital, striding slowly with his shoulders slouched and his hands in his pockets. His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side. Occasional traffic goes by. Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look, but Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. Still ruminating, he stands up, fixes his pants, and walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway. He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room. The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera with rows of periodicals lining the wall behind him. The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk, looking stunned. The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes as he walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face. Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians. Hannah, crying, blows her nose and sobs, clutching her tissue to her face. They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room. The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee. Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. The sun pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen. Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins. He sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch, rubbing his forehead. Norman chuckles as Mickey starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol and sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts, then stops his pacing and looks at the group. He starts to pace behind the couch anew, then stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman. Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against the wall. Norman and Carol remain silent, then turn to each other, reacting. Carol glances at Norman and chuckles nervously. He takes a sip of coffee. Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting.",
    "517": "She runs into the building and the taxi drives away. Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah. Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen, wearing a robe over a slip and stockings, drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her but doesn't go in. Norma reacts, turning to her daughter, who has her back turned, busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks. Hannah takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water. Evan, ignoring his wife's outburst, continues to tell his story as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den. He walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top, and picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen. The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks, still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before, holding the water glass and the pills. Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano. Hannah goes back to Norma, takes the glass of water away, and hands her mother a cup of coffee, putting her mother's hands on the cup. Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen. The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect and moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up and Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter. She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder. Mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen and stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation. Norma chortles and Hannah laughs, touching her mother. They walk over to Evan at the piano. Norma leans over the piano and Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows her hair and she hugs the Edward Estlin Cummings book to her chest.",
    "518": "She is deep in thought and stops at the edge of the wharf. The camera moves to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water. The piano piece ends and the film is quiet. The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen. The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module. From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science- fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module. Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays. Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey. The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers his face with his hand. Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief. Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs. Suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting. Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline. Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly. As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk. Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.",
    "519": "Gail sighs as she slams a door closed, distracted, popping a piece of gum into her mouth while Mickey speaks and sighs. Pedestrians pass by as the camera moves up a hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. Elliot, his back to the camera, opens the door to Lee, closing it behind her as she enters. They stand close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall, then walk further into the room. Elliot puts his arm around Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some pictures, a table with a lamp, and the foot of the bed. She looks out the window, turning when Elliot speaks and walks over to her. He takes her into his arms, and they kiss, almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. Elliot removes Lee's coat without breaking the kiss, and they embrace, kissing lightly then more passionately. The harpsichord music begins to play again as Lee lies contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows. Elliot enters, sitting on the edge of the bed with a cigarette, and they hold hands, chuckling. He leans down, and they begin to kiss passionately. Later, Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain, bareheaded, as a car drives by and a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella. She passes a well-lit restaurant and enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching her soaking hair, and walks through the living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits at a table drinking coffee and reading the paper. As he talks, Lee turns on the bathroom light, takes off her coat, and dries her hair with a towel. Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down. She fills a kettle with water and, as Frederick continues his monologue, strikes a wooden match, lights a burner, takes a glass from the cupboard, goes into the bathroom for pills, fills the glass with water, and takes her pills.",
    "52": "Reggie is on the phone. Dyle is also on the phone. She opens the door of the cabin and steps out, starting to look in the other cabins. All are occupied except one, and she looks inside it, confused as the receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth. Meanwhile, Dyle and Scobie stand together, waiting for the elevator, with Scobie clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. The self-service elevator doors open, one or two passengers come out, and Dyle and Scobie enter. A young girl starts to follow them in, but Dyle reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand, and the doors close. As the elevator arrives, Scobie follows Dyle out and looks around, seeing an open door at the end of a short hall. They go to it, revealing a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor as Dyle yawns wide. Dyle gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by Scobie. Dyle stops at the door and opens it, revealing that the stairs continue up. They emerge onto a level portion of the roof with a spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. Dyle turns and looks, finding nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street. Moving quickly, Dyle lashes out and hacks Scobie's gun hand with the side of his palm, causing the gun to fall to the roof. Following through, Dyle punches Scobie full in the jaw, but Scobie wraps his arm around Dyle, holding on tightly until his head clears. To Dyle's amazement, he is lifted into the air and carried toward the edge of the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, Dyle suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as Scobie's metal claw rips through both, leaving a wound from the center of Dyle's back to his shoulder. Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously, and leap for it, landing short of the mark. Now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun as the battle shifts in favor of Scobie whose weight and strength begin to tire Dyle, who is now on his back, trying to stop Scobie from crawling over him.",
    "523": "The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead. Holly pauses, looking at her sister, then they continue to walk. Holly looks at her sister for a beat. A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away, passing Holly and briefly looking at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage. The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience. The camera has reached the executives in the audience. They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk. Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head. The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey. The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. The movie cuts to Mickey's face. The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to pour the tea into china cups. Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap. The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment. Mickey's mother stands in the front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically. His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen. Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son. Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink. Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room. Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway. He starts to pound it. Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door.",
    "525": "Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead, then starts pounding on a door again. The movie then cuts to a beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ painting and shuffling from side to side to get its eyes' 3-D effect. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the saint. Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco facade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.",
    "531": "The mirror shatters. Mickey, holding the rifle, runs over to the shattered mirror. He then runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. Returning onscreen, panting, he looks frantically around the living room. Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk. The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing. The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park. They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. They stroll offscreen. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove. As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses. Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin. Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting. The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.",
    "537": "The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David. The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought. The screen cuts to black and a title appears. The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes down the street. She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise; the music stops. They begin to walk down the street. She shrugs. They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row.",
    "539": "Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff and head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden. They see four men digging with shovels and pick-axes. The fourth man wears a leather waist jacket and brown felt fedora hat. Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box. Fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock and puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. Halfbreed pushes Roscoe as he jumps with excitement. Rough Rider steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it. Fedora takes a bejeweled cross from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it. Indy takes off his hat and looks down at the off screen action. Fedora continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. Indy turns back to observe the men. A look of resolve comes into Indy's expression, and he turns back toward Herman. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror as a snake slithers across his lap. Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. Herman gasps. Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer. Indy releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the Cross. Fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g. Indy picks up the Cross. As Fedora stands watching the other men digging, Indy puts the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention. The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy, they almost knock each other over in the attempt. Only Fedora is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions -- then sets off after Indy. Indy emerges from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day. He hears running footsteps behind him and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe are quick to appear and run after him. Indy jumps from one rock to another; the Scout Troop horses are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his belt. Indy prepares to jump into the saddle and jumps.",
    "540": "Cafe customers are startled to see Indy and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and two other Turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns. He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and leap into a motorboat. Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock, but not before a Turkish agent jumps in with him. Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy and the Turk trade punches. Kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock and chase after Indy. Indy grapples with the Turkish agent. As Indy grips his arms, we see a gun in the agent's hand. It fires. As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes. Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish agent. Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat. It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the two freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls. One enemy speedboat chases Indy between the two freighters. It's a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another. Indy's speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap, but the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water. Spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see Kazim's speedboat appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, firing a machine gun at Indy and Elsa. The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A chattering machine gun from Kazim's boat splinters the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat catches. The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish agents in the boat with him. As Indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish agents to the deck, then turns his attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water. Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.",
    "542": "Thunder explodes in the distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the formidable stone castle. Indy reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip. He glances up to the beret Elsa is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it. A butler walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and Elsa standing outside in the rain. She now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret. Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. As Indy says this, he pushes his way past the startled butler, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, taking off her coat. Indy sneezes hard. Indy dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on in amused amazement. The butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold. Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of Nazi soldiers working around a large table with a map atop it. Indy reacts to the sight of them. Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens. Indy points out an electrical wire. He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door -- there is no response. He looks back at Elsa and enters. The room is dark and empty. Indy throws open the window shutters and looks out. Rain comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window -- but below that is a sheer drop. He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. Indy swings from the window to the stone gargoyle. A pair of wooden shutters seals the window. Indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet, swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended, crashing through the wooden shutters as a clap of thunder disguises the noise. Indy crashes through shutters and glass into the room. Stunned, Indy sinks to one knee, and Indy's father, Professor Henry Jones, steps out of the shadows. Indy gets to his feet. Now they look at each other. Indy and Henry press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. Indy steps to the window and looks down. Henry moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look. Henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand.",
    "546": "Elsa is walking away in an open area with torches, vehicles, and Nazi Officers in the background. One of them is Indy, who approaches her from behind. Indy pushes Elsa against a column and searches her clothing for the Diary, pulling the book from her pocket. His hands fly to her neck, but he releases her and backs away. She looks at him with a lover's pain. Indy moves over to Henry, and they almost run into Hitler and his entourage coming down from the Podium. Fifty kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature, and Hitler pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way, and they make eye contact. Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, signing his autograph on the first page, and handing it back before moving on. Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal, where a Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing Henry's picture to Nazi Soldiers inside. Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder. They begin to walk toward the boarding gates, with Henry looking over his newspaper at Indy. Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned. Rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin, Henry looks confused as everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face. Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it, then looks up from his Diary, closes it, and leans back in his seat. Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting for a response. Sunlight falls across the table from the window, turning like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks. Indy is puzzled. Indy and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin, where the elaborate metal framework is exposed. They hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a pair of doorways framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin, with plenty of blue sky and white clouds visible. A small biplane is suspended from the Zeppelin by a hook and crane device. Indy climbs into the cockpit of the biplane as Henry takes the tail gunner's seat. They both become aware of a strange sound in the skies behind them as two Messerschmidt fighter bombers streak out of the clouds and race across the sky. They shrink in their seats as the Messerschmidts, going three times as fast as they are, scream past on either side.",
    "548": "Indy and Henry run down the mountainside and towards the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants, and opens the chamber. A plane swings around and comes in for another pass. Henry hands his case to Indy. Holding his umbrella, Henry suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into a flock of sea gulls. The sea gulls take to the wing in flight, thousands of them, leading to a massacre as they are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a feathery white puree that splatters against the cockpit and clogs the engine, causing it to sputter. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies and explodes in an off camera sound effect. Indy stands stunned, a statue, as Henry walks back to him. Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down the beach. The Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter Donovan and Vogel, surrounded by his minions. Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages. Donovan and the Sultan walk together through an archway. The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk but goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby. The Sultan points to the engine under the hood, revealing Kazim, the spy at the court. Elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward Donovan and Vogel. Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets, Indy beside him and Henry in the back seat. Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a camel herder. Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it. Elsa and Donovan's party, consisting of a supply truck, tank, and various other vehicles, all move along through the ramble of this box canyon. Elsa, Donovan, and Vogel travel in the open car. The tank is a vintage World War I model with enormous treads. Turkish soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers. Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying Donovan. Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a car containing all of their supplies. Donovan notices a reflection from the hills, and at that moment, the tank fires a shell in their direction. It whistles overhead and blows up the parked car. Indy, Henry, and Sallah cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below. Bullets explode off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa duck. A Nazi soldier falls from the tank as bullets explode around him. Kazim's men, Brethren of the Cruciform Sword, continue to fire.",
    "550": "Indy attempts to mount his horse but the horse moves, causing Indy to land on his feet. He then successfully mounts his horse. Fedora and his men arrive to see Indy gallop off. Fedora whistles, signaling a vintage truck and automobile to emerge from behind the Pueblo, driven by more gang members. The passenger in the car has his face concealed by a hat, but his olive-colored hand is visible. Indy spurs his horse to greater speeds, but the vehicles keep pace. Indy veers off toward a railroad track as a train barrels down. He rides up beside it and leaps from his horse onto the train, clinging to a boxcar. Halfbreed and Rough Rider follow, leaping from the truck onto the train. Indy evades Halfbreed, leaping onto another boxcar, then onto covered boxes on a flatcar. Despite losing his balance momentarily, Indy regains it and enters a trap door, finding himself on a catwalk above vats of reptiles. Halfbreed and Rough Rider follow. Halfbreed grabs Indy's feet, but Indy kicks free and crawls away. The catwalk begins to collapse under their weight, and Indy's end drops, plunging him into a vat of water with an enormous anaconda. Roscoe appears and grabs Indy, who kicks free. Indy climbs over circus equipment, with Roscoe in pursuit using a hooked stick to trip Indy onto the roof of a rhino boxcar, causing a lamp to fall and hit a black rhinoceros.",
    "556": "Indy and Roscoe struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE. Meanwhile, a rhino raises his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF. As the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from Indy's head, Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again -- RIGHT. Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider hurry out of the car. Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a WATER TANK alongside the track directly up ahead. In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the distance -- and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT. He catches it perfectly, but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With Indy hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see Fedora walking toward him. As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below. Indy CRASHES down from above. Dust rises. The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in his direction. Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS AROUND Roscoe's hand. Roscoe SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER -- releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. He LEAPS ONTO THE NEXT CAR. Indy swings down to the caboose. He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside. Fedora puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow Indy. The caboose contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. Indy rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears Fedora coming, and dives into a MAGIC BOX. Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away. Fedora is mystified, frustrated and angered. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees: Indy RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses. Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father. Indy charges in.",
    "558": "Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. He sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard and lunges for it. He snatches up the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him. Several more drums come Indy's way. He turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. He sees a large stevedore's hook above him and climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain, Indy bobs up in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths. Dressed in professorial tweeds, Indy stands before his class. Laughter. Marcus Brody approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture. Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room. Indy stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk. Brody approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall. Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as Brody examines the Cross. Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door. He turns back toward Brody, now holding the Cross. Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his private office. Indy slips into his office, where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. Then, Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the window, slides it open and steps out into the garden. Indy escapes through the garden. He walks briskly toward the street, smiling, enjoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a long black Packard sedan pulls up before him. Three men step out of the sedan. Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. After a moment, Walter Donovan enters from across the room. During the brief time that the door is open, we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room: voices and soft.",
    "560": "A limo is parked beside a private airliner that bears the Donovan corporate logo. Brody peers inside to Donovan and Indy. Indy opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages, superimposed over a map that traces a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water. Suddenly a woman comes up to him. Attractive features, blonde hair, eyes that are bright and intelligent. She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The woman turns to Brody, who tips his hat. The woman, Dr. Elsa Schneider, extends her hand to Brody. Indy's grin fades. Brody registers a look of surprise. Indy, Brody, and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on either side. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa. She hands a slip of paper to Indy. Indy extends the scrap of paper to Brody. Elsa leads Indy and Brody into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building. They have arrived at the front steps of the library. Elsa leads the way inside. Indy, Brody, and Elsa enter, their heels clicking across the marble floor. We notice, along with Indy and Brody, that the library contains many stained-glass windows. She indicates four huge marble columns that go from floor to ceiling. Indy glances at the columns, then notices a stained-glass window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window. The minute Elsa is out of earshot, Indy whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane. Brody glances at the Diary, then at the window -- noticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings -- charged with the thrill of discovery. Indy's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns. Indy looks again to the stained-glass window. He points. Indy has discovered that each column is numbered with a Roman numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. He points again to the stained-glass window. He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands. Indy walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a loft and looks down at Brody and Elsa. Indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the center tile where the two sides of the X intersect.",
    "563": "He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. The Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened Mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them. The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and squeals to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. Two men get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. Kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, Dee, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. Silence on the road. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there. Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway. He pulls out a small laser device, which he zips neatly down the front of the man's clothes. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- a scaly space bastard, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it. Mikey replies -- an unfathomable combination of grunts, squeaks, and saliva. Mikey makes a lame squeak. From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified gasp. Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around too. All three of them see Agent Janus, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. Janus freezes, terrified. Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground. The other INS Agents burst over the rise, shouting questions. From over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.",
    "564": "Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out. Kay looks up sharply. Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. Laurel is at the end of her rope. Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out. He starts to reach for his gun. Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it. Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him. And with that, he turns, leaps, and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft. EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing. Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway. And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting at the intersection. He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people. Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above. Just then, a loud ALARM wails. AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking a region of planet earth. Headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off. Viewing the screen, it now reads. Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we. The real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away.",
    "569": "Edwards watches as one of the Worm Aliens responds in its native language and indicates the counter. Elevator doors slide open, revealing the Men in Black headquarters. Edwards is captivated, but Kay grasps his arm, rushing him along. They pass piles of advanced devices on shelves and surfaces. Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from a shelf before they exit. On the main floor, they quickly cross to a giant world map display with blinking lights and data. Screens show live alien images. Bony fingers appear, and Edwards looks at Kay as an alien with cat glasses and a mean face is shown. Zed, near the screen, approaches Edwards. Zed's voice is heard as Edwards opens a white locker containing a black suit and shiny black shoes. Kay is at a computer displaying Edwards's personal documents. Zed's voice continues as Edwards stands in a white booth, hands on a ten-fingered keypad that glows red, altering his fingerprints with lasers. Kay deletes Edwards's identity cards one by one. Edwards's full name, James Darrel Edwards III, appears on the screen, letters gradually eliminated. With a tie adjusted, James D Edwards III, now Jay, steps out in a sharp suit and slips on sunglasses. Meanwhile, an older man, Rosenberg, carries a cat and a rosewood box, setting them down to lock his shop. Edgar, with aged, loose neck skin, sits in his Orkin van, spotting Rosenberg exit a jewelry shop. Rosenberg secures his shop, then picks up the cat and box, walking away with one under each arm.",
    "57": "Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled. Gittes sighs. She begins to cry softly. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him. There is a long moment of silence. She nods. He gets out and slams the car door. The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it. Pads around in elegant silk pajamas. He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything. Gittes slowly rises to one elbow. He hangs up, falls back down. Gittes swears, picks it up. Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco. Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. He opens it and enters. Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen. Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees Ida Sessions lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar. Gittes enters and turns on the light. Escobar and another plainclothed man stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A third man is now coming down the hall from the bedroom. The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.",
    "570": "Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along behind him. Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk. Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly. Zed looks over at it. JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters. ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties. Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment -- -- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. The Driver hands over some documents. The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest. It vomits on him. Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car. CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck. He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming.",
    "577": "Susan is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, experiencing an instant and wide spectrum of emotions. Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction. He has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer. Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy. Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops, then pivots, and follows Parrish out the proper door. Parrish turns back to the bedroom. Joe tests the springs. Meanwhile, Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly. Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff. In another scene, a spectacular indoor Olympic pool, with a window commanding views of the skyline, Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit. Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him. However now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is. Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, points to a stack of towels. Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan. Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter. He finishes the spoonful, shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate. Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. She watches, fascinated, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful. Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone. Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully. Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him. He has now, with some difficulty, completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken. They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, uncharacteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out. Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room. Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob. Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.",
    "580": "Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment, then starts up the stairs. Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish descends. Joe senses Parrish's tone and doesn't answer. Parrish measures Joe, his jaw sets. Susan seems distracted. Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards. There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in. Quince sips the red, now the white, then pours some of each into one glass. Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly, drains his wine, then one more glass, and heads out. Parrish and Joe fall silent. Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating. Parrish is beginning to reach Joe. Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the party. Joe blinks, at a loss. She waits. He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace. Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence. Susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her. She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her. Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself. Joe enters, Parrish looks up. Parrish waits, regards him sympathetically. The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door. Quince appears, flushed with excitement. Parrish weighs the information for a moment. Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker- phone. Quince leads the way through the lights and MUSIC. Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony. Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room. Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and closes the door behind him. Drew takes a seat. Joe can no longer control himself. Parrish is struck dumb. He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and then commandingly. Drew is all attention. Joe steps forward. Parrish clicks the speakerphone off. Drew is staring at Joe, shaking his head. Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune. Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back. Now Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests. Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.",
    "583": "Trina smiles and looks at the passengers from her jump seat. Whip takes the phone and speaks into the intercom. He pours the contents of a small vodka bottle into a juice container hidden from the passengers' view, tosses three miniature bottles, and takes a long drink as Margaret exits the toilet and he goes in. Nicole gets out of the car and runs up to the second floor of a small run-down apartment complex. She pulls out a key as she reaches the door, only to discover it is slightly open. She smiles at him as he stands in the doorway. She kicks the door closed, flings her bag on a table, and it hits a box which falls and scatters its contents. She spots a syringe, lightly taps it, pushes out a small drop that slides down the needle, tightens a tourniquet around her arm and holds the end securely in her mouth, positions the needle and injects. Her arms relax and she lets go of the syringe, leans back, eyes closed. The strap falls from her mouth, her head lulls to her shoulder, and her dilated pupils shrink to tiny dots. She grabs the packet of cocaine that Kip gave her and falls on her side. The packet falls inches from her hand. Her fingers reach out, but only push it away. Her hand goes still as feet appear under the door. In the cockpit, Whip sleeps with paper covering his eyes and his sunglasses over the paper. Ken's yoke jerks away, slips out of his hands as Whip struggles to gain control and the plane begins to dive. The wheels of the aircraft unfold. In the galley, Margaret grabs the phone and unbuckles her seat belt. Alarmed passengers grasp the seat in front of them as a flight attendant tries to assist someone. Cammie falls and hits her head, lies still. Whip banks to the left, the plane turns upside down. She slides the side-stick forward, one wheel gets stuck while retracting. Inside the cabin, Cammie comes to a rest on the ceiling. Trina sees a young boy slip out of his seat. Outside Georgian Gardens, a medical aide wheels Nicole beside Fran as the upside down plane flies past. Trina crawls to the boy and straps him back in his seat. A light flashes on the control panel in the cockpit. The plane turns upright, and the still-unconscious Cammie falls on some passengers. Trina loses her hold and falls against the bulkhead. Fire and smoke billow from the left engine.",
    "585": "He enters Whip's room with a video camera as a nurse helps Whip from the bed exposing his buttocks. The nurse leaves the room. Harling places his hand on Whip's head and leaves. Whip closes his eyes. Whip is startled awake. He looks around the dark room, then, clicks on the light. He peeks into the corridor as a nurse walks by the reception desk. He quickly limps down the hall using a cane. He sees Nicole sitting on the stairs smoking a cigarette. She rises to leave. She sits. Whip leans against the wall facing her. He lights a cigarette. She shakes her head. A patient climbs the stairs. Nicole tosses her pack. The gaunt man stands by his IV pole. She shakes her head. She glances at Whip. The bold man turns to Whip. Cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the man picks up the IV pole and walks down the stairs. She wipes a tear from her eye, offers a smile, then stands and climbs up the stairs. A black Cadillac lurches out of the hospital parking structure and passes the news crews parked outside. Harling opens a beer and takes a swig. He hands Whip a package. A bundle of cash. A car turns into a dirt driveway. The car passes a dilapidated shed on the right and pulls up to large older farmhouse. Whip stops the car. Whip places a bag beside the door and reaches above one of the wooden posts supporting the veranda roof. He grabs a hidden key. He enters a cozy, fully furnished living room and looks around. A retro stereo sits on a cabinet against the wall with framed photos. Whip, his eyes still covered by a bandage, looks around. Whip carries a plastic bag into the kitchen and places it on a dining table. He plugs in a charger and checks his iPhone. It shows 127 voice messages. He leans on a bureau and pulls out a prescription bottle from his pocket. He glances at the pills, then, at a decanter of whiskey. Another liquor bottle's near the stereo. He licks his lips and clenches his jaw. Using a cane for support, he strides into the bathroom and dumps the pills down the toilet. He collects the bottles of liquor and the decanter and turns on the stereo. He empties the bottles in the sink. Then, he dumps the empties in the garbage. He takes a case of Corona and some other beer cans from the fridge, and also, drains them. He dumps the cans in a bin. He takes a bag of marijuana from a wooden box in a drawer and flushes it. He continues his chore with determination as he moves from cabinet to cabinet, removing and tossing bottles and cans.",
    "588": "Whip stands in a dark suit and watches the procession pass. A young boy touches Whip's arm. Whip turns around and sees Margaret. He goes to her and they hug. Margaret reaches for her son and pulls him close. Both watch as Trevor goes off to find his dad. They hug again. She looks at him with tears in her eyes. They stare at each other, unmoving. He wipes her tears with his thumb. Margaret watches him, her brow creased and her eyes soft with sympathy. He kisses her and leaves. Whip leans against his car in a parking lot and watches an airplane overhead. Nicole approaches in quick strides. They hug. She hands him a Zippo. He sticks a cigarette in his mouth. A man stands at a podium. Whip sits semi-slumped in a chair. The majority in the room lift their hands, including Nicole. Whip crosses his arms. Whip leaves. Whip parks outside a bar and walks in as his co-pilot, Ken, appears on the news. Whip exits the bar. At the hospital, Whip walks over to a private room and peeps in. He taps his cane on the door frame. A nurse dresses Ken's wounds. Vicky and Ken look toward Whip. Ken turns to the nurse. Ken's left leg lies on a brace. Whip closes the door. He sits down. Whip arises to leave. Ken reaches for Whip's hands. Whip's eyes dart up and down. He takes Ken's hands. Later at Whip's family farm, Nicole sees the lights on in the hangar. Whip leans over the Cessna. Still wearing his tie, his shirt's sleeves rolled up. He jumps off a ladder and hustles over to Nicole, kissing her. He sips his beer. She notices cocaine on the table. Nicole sits on the bed. She ends a call and continues packing her things in the bedroom. She ignores Whip. Whip takes a large swig before setting the bottle on a table and entering the bedroom. Nicole walks past Whip, raising a hand to her head before she sits on the bed. He sits next to her on the bed. She leans in and their foreheads touch. He kisses her and she allows him to pull her into an embrace. In the morning, Whip lies sleeping on the bed fully dressed. Nicole stands at the bedroom entrance and looks at him. She leaves an envelope with Whip's name on it between his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. She carries a suitcase and a basket, and walks away from the house. Sheila's van is parked behind some trees and Nicole puts her things in. The van drives off. Whip stops as he sees the envelope, then, trots over to the table and picks it up, opening it.",
    "595": "Holding a small tin and a pair of scissors, he attempts to cut a piece of plant. It waves its vine-like tentacles. Harry walks past and spots him. He approaches and gives Slughorn a fright. He walks away. Slughorn glances around furtively. Harry walks up a grassy hillock. Slughorn lags a little way behind. Ahead, he sees Hagrid, his dog, and Harry by the corpse of a colossal spider. Harry demonstrates with his fingers. A bit of spider breaks off. Slughorn drops it on the ground. Slughorn looks up at the giant Hagrid. Slughorn bows his head and closes his eyes. In Hagrid's cottage, Harry applauds the tipsy duo. Hagrid's eyes closed and his head tilts back. It thuds against the high-backed chair. Harry grins. Slughorn looks across the room at Harry. His smile fades. Harry gulps and stares at the old man. The scar on his forehead. He stands up. Wide eyed, Slughorn gazes at the boy standing before him. He blinks and his eyes moisten. Slughorn presses the tip of his wand against his temple. He closes his eyes then pulls the wand away. Attached to it is a wisp of vapor, the memory. His hand shaking, he holds up a small test tube. As he inverts the wand, Harry steadies Slughorn's hand. The memory drops into the container. In his study, Dumbledore pours it into the pensive. The memory begins with the hour glass. The teenage Tom Riddle turns away from Slughorn and walks towards the fire, hands behind his back. Tom fiddles with a ring on his finger. He turns to face Slughorn. Slughorn looks into the boy's cold eyes. The memory ends. Dumbledore holds up a hand to silence Harry. Looking troubled, the professor walks away from the pensive. He crosses his study and sinks down onto a short flight of steps. Dumbledore hurries to his desk. He holds it up. Harry touches the ring. It spins. Images of the teenage Tom, the boy in the orphanage, the pebbles on the window ledge, the postcard of the coast, Voldemort. The ring stops spinning. Harry flexes his neck. Dumbledore moves around the desk and looks closely at Harry. Harry breathes deeply. Snape abruptly leaves the astronomy tower. Descending the stairs, he meets Harry who has overheard his exchange with Dumbledore. He stops in front of Harry for a moment then continues his descent. Harry climbs up to the upper platform. Harry rubs his chin self-consciously. They walk to the balustrade. Harry nods. Harry hesitates. Harry places his hand on Dumbledore's arm and they shoot off the tower. White-tipped waves roll towards a pinnacle rising out of the sea. Harry and Dumbledore stand on top of it.",
    "604": "Hermione puts one arm over Harry's shoulder and the other over Ron's. Ahead of them, Katie Bell lies on her back in the snow, her body wrenching from side to side. She shoots up into the air, hovering with arms outstretched and her mouth open in a muted scream, then crashes down onto the snow and lies on her back, her head shaking. Hagrid arrives on the scene. They step aside, and the giant Hagrid picks Katie up. Harry walks towards something lying on the ground. A necklace of blue stones lies on the snow, tipped out of its box. Harry folds back the wrapping paper. Back inside its box, the necklace lies on a desk. Professor McGonagall studies it, then turns to Leanne. Hermione, Ron, and Harry face McGonagall. Snape arrives and waves his wand, causing the necklace to rise into the air. McGonagall looks at Snape. The others stare at him. Harry is the last to lower his gaze. Harry lies on his bed with the Marauder's Map and sees Malfoy moving on it. Ron is lying in bed with his hands behind his head, and both boys look uneasy. Harry takes off his glasses and puts them on the map on his bedside table. Malfoy disappears from the map. At Professor Slughorn's supper party, twin girls look round at Hermione. Everyone is enjoying dessert. The door opens and Ginny comes in. She's been crying. Harry is the only one to stand as Ginny comes to the table. He grins politely as he bends down to retrieve his napkin. Hermione watches him. Cormac, his eyes fixed on Hermione, sucks his little finger suggestively. Embarrassed, she turns away. Slughorn turns and his eyes open wide. Harry stares at the photographs. Taken aback, Slughorn stands rooted to the spot. Harry gives a faint smile. The sand in the hourglass drifts in a slow spiral, from top to bottom. It's held upright by snakes with green glass bodies and golden heads. Ron is kitted out in his Quidditch gear, including his leather helmet. He enters the Great Hall, looking totally miserable, and sits down in front of his breakfast plate, a fried egg on a square of dry toast, surrounded by four toast triangles. Hermione smiles knowingly. Harry turns away. Lavender bounces up and goes. Ron looks even more miserable. He passes Ron a goblet. Ron looks at Hermione and Harry. Harry puts a glass vial in his pocket. Ron lifts the goblet to his lips and drinks. Hermione glares and Harry smiles. Ron smiles broadly. The two friends clasp hands over the table. The game is played in a snowstorm. A bound leather Quaffle zooms through the air and is caught by a Slytherin Chaser. His green cape flapping behind him, he joins his teammates, who flank him as they charge for goal.",
    "610": "Over an adjacent street, gunshots echo. Sydney stares straight ahead as a taxi drops him and his luggage up a street lined with shops with graffitied shutters. He gazes up at a rundown tenement building, then lowers his eyes to see a grimy kebab shop named Kebab Palace. Mrs. Kowalski leads Sydney into his grotty studio apartment. Inside, she slaps him, then leaves with her nose in the air. Later, tiles on the dance floor light up as Sydney struts from one disinterested group of girls to another, waving his hands and moving his pelvis. He wiggles his backside and leaps about, causing the girls to retreat wildly before stopping. Sydney puffs out his cheek and walks off as the dance floor lights up again. On the street outside, Sydney passes a leggy blonde in a green dress. He glances over his shoulder to see her enter a bar with a red wood paneled exterior. Turning on his heel, he hastily follows her inside where the blonde heads for the bar. Sydney enters, adjusts his jacket, and confidently sidles up beside her. Affecting a suave smile, he takes his seat facing her and leans on the bar, but gags on his drink. Turning back to the leggy blonde, he then turns his back on a second woman, who is pretty with flaxen hair. The blonde leaves, and Sydney takes out a newspaper clipping. He spills the second woman's drink, ruining her soggy notebook. She puts her phone away, gathers her belongings, glares at him with furrowed brows, and leaves. Bobbie, a buxom brunette in a zebra print dress, takes the second woman’s seat. Sydney nods, eyebrows raised. Back at Sydney's sparse, undecorated apartment, Bobbie staggers off into the bedroom. Sydney takes a record, flings it over his head, replaces it, and thrashes out power cords on it, flailing wildly until the record suddenly stops. He turns to see Bobbie naked. Mrs. Kowalski slaps him, and they turn to look at Bobbie, their eyebrows shooting up in unison. Sydney wakes at 7:00 AM to the sound of his alarm clock. Grimacing, he fumbles around and turns it off. Sunlight streams in through a bedside window. He yanks the cord of his venetian blind, which clatters down on top of him. He tumbles from the bed, spits in the sink, sips urine-colored water from a glass, and spits it out over the mirror. In a gray tee-shirt and boxer shorts, he raises a blind in the living room. Half asleep under a blanket, Bobbie adjusts his genitals. Sydney later strolls through Times Square in a tee-shirt, seeing garish billboards compete with towering glass walled office blocks, one of which reaches high into the sky.",
    "611": "Sidney enters reception and collides with an immovable turnstile, then staggers round. Attractive women dwarf him in an elevator. A petite brunette in a gray suit leads him into a spacious office. A be-suited man with shoulder length silver hair stands at a window staring out over the city. Clayton Harding turns to look at him. Sidney reaches into his shoulder bag and proffers a red tee-shirt. Clayton slings it out of an open window. A post-modern review depicting Clayton as a nude king. Sidney's smile fades as he meets with an indifferent stare. Clayton leaps through the offending issue. Doc suited Lawrence leads him into a private office. Sidney glances at his bright red tee-shirt and fidgets before pointing at a photograph on the wall. It's the woman whose drink he spilled in the bar. In an open-plan office Sidney crosses to Alison and perches on her desk. She works at a computer, co-worker in a polka dot dress frowns. With a phone to his ear Sidney pulls over a sheet of printed photographic negatives, he adjusts his specs. She hangs up. The corners of his mouth downturned. He peers at the contact sheet through a magnifying eye-glass to see two portly middle aged gentlemen holding glasses of wine. He hits redial, he looks at the telephone receiver and frowns. Munching a hamburger Sidney enters the lobby through a revolving door, blond in an A-line dress joins him. As the door starts to close she reaches out towards a hastily approaching colleague. Quickly retracts her hand as the door slams shut, she narrows her eyes disapprovingly. It starts its descent, the doors open. She strides out in a huff to Alison, who is wearing sharp suit. Ignoring Sidney she opens a book and starts to read. Tight-lipped she stares down at her book, Alison lowers her eyes as a golden haired woman in her mid-40s wearing expensive sunglasses steps into the lift and turns her back on them. Sidney goes to swallow a mouthful of burger, but gags. A glob of chewed burger shoots out of his mouth and lands with a splat on the back of the woman's cream jacket. Sidney goes to wipe it off. Grabbing his wrist an incredulous Alison shakes her head. Sidney and Alison hurry out. He takes a bite of burger. Sidney rolls his eyes as he listens in. Night, Sidney gazes out through the window of a sleek black automobile as it glides through Manhattan. Alison and Lawrence seem indifferently thumb their mobiles phones. He looks out on the gaudy lights of Time Square. Sidney turns to his colleagues. They eyeball him then look back at their phones.",
    "613": "Flustered, he looks down at Elizabeth, then lifts his chin, flutters his eyelids and steps over her. Alison gives him the A-OK and he walks on. In a staff meeting, his coworkers look on stony-faced. He prods Alison's arm. Clayton rises from his seat at the head of the table and walks out. Alison raises a palm to Sidney. Clayton eats edamame beans and sushi at the desk in his office. He tries to ignore Sidney, who's tapping a notebook with a pen. He nods. Bill's eyes narrow. Bill's expression hardens. A sheepish-looking Sidney sits opposite an indignant Clayton. Sidney's hopeful smile wanes. Clayton stares at Sidney, who furrows his brow and points at the door. Clayton nods and Sidney leaves. Alison reads as models pick outfits from a rack. Sidney plunks himself down beside her and sighs. Alison stares at him. She scoffs. She stands up. She flounces off with her nose in the air. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence and waves. Sidney's nose is taped up like a pig's snout. Eleanor and Sophie approach. He tears the tape from his face and hides under his desk. He emerges from beneath the table with Sellotape stuck to his left ear. Sidney frowns and obediently toddles off. He fills a plastic container from a water cooler. He stares at Sophie, who's cradling Cuba. He screws up his face. Slighted, Eleanor gives him a piercing look and stomps off. His eyebrows twitch and he looks around. Lawrence and Sophie follow Eleanor from the office. Sidney cautiously opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba staring back at him. He tosses the little red ball, which bounces out through an open window. Cuba scampers after it. Sidney dives for the window and closes it. Sidney smiles, then looks up to see a large stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen as the weighted, polished stone. Horrified, Sidney bites his fist. He calls an elevator. She points. They grapple for it. A white paw sticks out. Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception. Sidney runs off. Alison follows to find Sidney leaning out of a window. He turns minus the bag. She turns. She turns to look at Sidney, who shrugs, arms folded. The search party heads off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a wall by the window. Cuba's nose sticks out of the leather handbag as it drifts up behind him on the window cleaner's rising platform. Sidney stands in the doorway of Clayton's office. He sips whiskey. He flings the blue shirts onto a desk and peers down his nose at them. He gestures with a raised hand. Smiling, Clayton strolls up to him. Sidney leaves, then steps back in.",
    "615": "A bearded man with long gray hair waves to her daughters, non-plussed. Sydney ponders as a beer bottle emerges over the railing of the bandstand. Drunk Sydney climbs up onto the railing behind the band and addresses the crowd with his arms out. The guests resume their conversations. Sydney limps up to Alison who sits alone in the half-light with a bottle of wine in her lap, gently rocking on a swing. He skulks off, then races back, gesticulating wildly. Alison strides off tearfully, leaving a dumbstruck Sydney staring after her. She quickly returns and kicks it. He slumps down on the rope swing, then falls backwards onto the grass. Shimmering lights play on the rippling surface of the swimming pool. Sydney lies on his belly by the water's edge. Sophie's reflection appears like a mirage on the water and he rolls over to look up. She kneels down beside him, then lies down beside him on her belly. She rolls onto her back and moves closer to him, staring up at the stars. Sydney bites his bottom lip. Smiling, she turns her head to look at Sydney, who lies on his side, gazing at her. Dappled by a pale shifting light, she looks back up at the stars. Sydney springs to his feet and races off through the party. The man hands Sydney a small Ziploc bag of white powder. Sydney runs off. Alison is bent over, drunkenly failing to unlock her car door. Holding Alison upright, Sydney gazes over at Sophie, kneeling by the pool. Sydney drives with Alison in the passenger seat. They drive on down a dark stretch of road. She presses her lips together, stifling tears, then vomits. Alison is slung over Sydney's shoulder. Sydney sits in his apartment with his bespectacled father and Mrs. Kowalski. Wearing Sydney's jacket, Alison puts a song on in his bedroom. Mrs. Kowalski gives Alison a sideways look as she dances out to join them. The bag of white powder. Alison joins them on the sofa, then covers her mouth. Balding, brown-suited Richard stands as Mrs. Kowalski leads Alison to Sydney's bedroom. Sydney washes up as his father returns a framed portrait photo of a woman to a shelf. Richard looks blank, then sidles up behind him at the sink. Richard goes to put a hand on Sydney's shoulder but can't bring himself to do it. He turns away. Richard puts a copy of his book down on the table. Sydney stares solemnly at his father, then reluctantly cracks a smile. Sydney opens the bedroom door, leaning his head against the door frame, he peers into the dark room where Alison lies sleeping. He smiles fondly. She stirs. Sydney's eyes dart left and right as he retreats from the room.",
    "617": "She looks at the floor. He raises his glass, then turns away, popping the fangs back in his mouth as he makes his way through the crowd. Alison has her back to him. A morose Sydney sits alone at the table, his goblet-like glass in front. Vincent and Elena sit in the back. Elena winds the window down. Vincent leans forward. Sydney steps back from the car window and knits his hands together by his chin. Drenched by the rain, he stares at them with window glides up. Elena smiles at the driver. The car pulls away, leaving a dispirited Sydney at the roadside, his hands clasped together, as if in prayer. His long cape hangs in a puddle on the pavement. He looks up at an electronic billboard from which Sophie stares at him. She blows a kiss. Breathing heavily, he hangs his head as the rain beats down on the dark street. In Clayton's office, Sydney smiles. Dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit and dark glasses, Sydney sits opposite Vincent in a sushi bar, hurriedly taking notes and smiling enthusiastically at Vincent's comments. Elena goes through Sydney's article, editing out the parts she doesn't like. She hands it back to him. He nods with a grateful smile as he looks it over. Sydney stands behind Elena and a dark-haired woman as they airbrush Vincent's publicity photographs on a computer. They digitally remove a pimple. Sydney takes a copy of Sharp's magazine from a news kiosk on a street corner. He flips through it to find his article. A broad smile spreads over Sydney's face. Sydney works at his computer in an office, his own. Over time, it fills up with various gift baskets. A female property agent shows Sydney around a spacious apartment. Someone hands Sydney a gift box at his desk, the new Omega Speedmaster watch. He takes off his old watch and flings it. Sydney's name is taped on a number of guest lists. Getting on like a house on fire, Sydney and Clayton share a joke in the lift. Wearing a white robe, Sydney sits in a steam room. A wide smile plays on his lips. Alison reads an article on Sydney in a magazine. She's sitting at a restaurant table. Lawrence joins her. On it is a white Russian cocktail. He reads over her shoulder. Lawrence removes his arm from round her shoulder, picks up his drink and takes a sip. As he walks away, Alison glances down at her novel and frowns. The exterior of Sydney's apartment building. Alison is Inside the building. Wearing a stripey robe, Sydney opens his door. Alison nods. Alison throws her head back with a sigh as he fetches some documents.",
    "619": "A locker door is plastered with photos and cuttings. She pulls out a folder and some pages fall to the floor as a boy comes by. Juno grins at her friend talking to a fat bearded teacher. In class, Bleeker swallows some Tic Tacs as Juno appears by his side clutching her folders. Another boy stands on the other side of the work table. A second girl turns up. Amanda leaves Josh open mouth. Bleeker suppresses a smile. Later, Juno dials a number. She vigorously shakes the phone and something falls out. She frowns at the phone. Juno throws up in a decorative urn. Juno's little sister sprinkles her food. Liberty Bell smiles slowly. Juno plods away past Su-Chin. Juno stops in her tracks. She shrugs and walks on towards the door of the Women Now Center. A punk girl sits in reception playing on her game console. Juno wanders into the lobby and steps up to the counter. Juno nods obediently. Juno takes the questionnaire clipboard to a padded leather bench and sits down. As she starts to fill in the form, she becomes aware of a black woman seated nearby crumbing her fingers against her clipboard. A woman painting her nails, another scratching her arm, another using a nail file add to the crescendo of sound. Juno drops her pen. Su-Chin brightens. They sit on a park bench scouring the paper. Leah hands pipe smoking Juno an ad. Bleeker is lying on his bed, looking at the photo of Juno in his yearbook. His other hand is clasped around a piece of cloth. Bleeker's solidly built double-chinned mother closes the door of his bedroom. He goes back to gazing at Juno's picture and brings his class pen from behind his head. Scrunched in his fingers, he's holding the knickers she wore and discarded on the day they had sex. At Juno's house, Leah watches apprehensively as Juno paces in front of her dad and her step mom. Mac and Bren brace themselves. Juno looks them both in the eye. Leah pulls a face. Juno meets her dad's bewildered gaze, then lets her head drop for a second before speaking. Mac shakes his head as she turns on her heels and hightails upstairs with Leah behind her. He runs his hands over his face. A slim young woman arranges some white hydrangeas in a glass vase. White cuffed hands straightens a glass photo frame. She places some aromatic sticks into a bottle. Mac with Juno beside him drives his blue Previa through the gates of the affluent looking Glacial Valley estate. With a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, fans out the display of coffee table magazines, straightens two monogram tan towels, and wipes a banister rail as Mac drives past a number of substantial houses set back from the road.",
    "620": "He slows down in front of one house with a triple garage and box tree on the front lawn and pulls up onto the driveway. As the woman carefully adjusts the buttons on her pristine white cuffs, Mac and Juno wearing everyday casual clothes stroll up to the double-fronted door flanked by two slim firs. Mac wipes his feet on the doormat. The woman with neatly combed long dark hair opens the door with a bright smile. Juno slaps Gerta's profit hand. Vanessa purses her lips and looks penetratingly at Juno. On the staircase, Juno in her loose checked shirt over jeans passes a lineup of post photos of Mark and Vanessa in white. She wanders into Vanessa's en suite bathroom and contemplates herself in the large mirror above the basin, smoothing the front of her hair. There are several expensive looking bottles and jars grouped around the basin, next to a white orchid in a pot. Opening one jar, she scoops out a finger full of cream and dabs it on her face. Then does a bodybuilder type snarl and pose. Picking up a bottle of perfume, she sniffs it and sprays her wrist, rubbing it against the other wrist. As she comes out of the bathroom, she collides with Mark. Her eye lights on the guitar. Mac points to some apparatus. Vanessa smiles proudly. Mac's attempted conversation is met with a baffled look. Then, he and both women look up towards the sound drifting down from the floor above. With a brittle smile, tall slim Vanessa hurries upstairs to find Mark and Juno duetting on guitars. Mac is looking at some forms. Mark closes the front door with a wry smile. Vanessa presses her hands together as if in prayer and lets him fold her in his arms. Vijay speeds up leaving Bleeker alone on the running track. Two boys pass him as he slows to a walk. At school, a grey haired starkly built woman in a mauve cardigan sits behind the desk looking disapprovingly at Juno bulging. The woman grudgingly signs a pink form and hands it to Juno. Juno smiles sweetly and comes out into the corridor. A technician spreads gel across Juno's distended belly with an ultrasound scan head. On a monitor next to her, Juno watches moving patches of light and dark take on a recognizable shape. Leah and Bren sigh with delight. Bren's lips tighten. With a look that could kill, the ultrasound technician leaves the room. In her room, with its walls covered in drawings, Juno lies on her bed, her legs propped up on cushions, gazing at the ultrasound print. She blinks thoughtfully and moments later is driving Mac's blue Previa out to Glacial Valley estate past its immaculate houses and lawns blanketed in snow.",
    "624": "A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue. An upstairs window looks out over the scene. Inside, a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family: mum, dad, a young boy and girl. The dad wears a clerical collar. Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand drawn children's pictures stuck to it. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door, then returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room and glances around. A younger man in a similar rural style bedroom suddenly jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen. Graham rushes out of his wooden farmhouse and heads towards a whitewashed barn, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor. Graham and the young man, Merrill, charge through a field of tall green maize. They stop when they reach a gap and look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop. A dark haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path. The two men run over to her, and Graham grabs her by the arms. Merrill picks up Bo and Graham dashes on through the maize. He reaches a fair haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field. Graham turns Morgan's head to face him. Morgan puts his hand around his father's jaw, and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring. Graham stands and slowly walks through the maize, followed by Merrill, who's still carrying Bo in his arms. Graham stops and glances around anxiously. He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks. Graham stares in wonder as he, Merrill, Morgan and Bo come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize. Two large Alsatians pace around uneasily in the center. An aerial view shows Graham and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter. Another crop circle lies beside it. It's the same size, but has a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it.",
    "626": "Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he's looking at his own reflection in the polished steel. Glancing up, he reaches forward and positions the knife at a downward sloping angle at the base of the door. Turning the knife in different directions, cans, bottles, and boxes of food are reflected in the blade. Graham withdraws the knife and puts it down on the floor beside him. Then frustrating himself on his belly, he makes to look under the door again. Having second thoughts, he grabs the knife and kneels up. Setting the knife back down on the worktop, he rises to his feet and head bowed strides determinedly out into the hallway. Stopping in his tracks, Graham turns and marches back in, seizing the knife. He lies on his stomach by the pantry door. A clawed hand shoots out from under the door. Startled, Graham bangs his head and drops the knife. Retrieving the knife, Graham slices off the creature's fingers. Startled, the flock of birds springs from the maize fields, scattering, and flying away. Later, Graham returns to the farm house. Locking the door behind him, he hurriedly checks the handle, then, walks off past the open living room door. He stops dead and stares, seeing Bo, Morgan, and now Merrill on the sofa wearing silver foil cone hats. Without flinching, Graham turns stiffly and goes to sit on the stairs. Merrill sits still with his hands on his knees. Graham links his hands together. Merrill turns to Morgan. Graham makes a pained frown. Putting one hand on the post at the bottom of the stairs, Graham pulls himself wearily up and plods into the living room, moving up to the sofa. Bo holds up one arm. Graham does the same. Morgan and Merrill raise their arms. Graham eyes them uncertainly. All three. Merrill and Bo lower their arms, Morgan settles himself back down on the sofa. Graham hesitates a moment then steps forward, and sits beside his son on the end of the couch. Morgan peers up at his father. Merrill stares blankly ahead. He sighs. Now, in broad daylight, Merrill leaves his converted barn holding a large white cotton sack. A cigarette in one hand, he jogs down the grey-painted wooden stairs on the side of the building then trudges across the lawn towards the farmhouse. As he takes a drag on the cigarette, his attention is drawn to the field of maize. Merrill throws the cigarette butt to the ground, then, slows to a gradual stop. Dumping the cotton sack, he reaches down, picks up a stone, and launches it into the field of maize. He stands immobile, watching the crop with anxious expectation.",
    "627": "Behind him, shrubs growing outside the farmhouse are buffeted by the growing wind. Merrill eyes the crops suspiciously, then, retreats. He picks up the cotton sack, jogs up the steps to the farmhouse veranda and hits indoors. Morgan and Bo are glued to the TV screen in the closet. Graham and Merrill arrive. They stand and watch. Graham looks uneasy. Merrill is deep in thought. The presenter shifts fearfully. Unflinching, Graham stares directly at the television screen. Standing rooted to the floor, Graham continues to scrutinize the images on the TV. His features sagging mournfully as he reflects on the presenter's words. He wanders off, leaving Merrill alone with Morgan and Bo. The two children are mesmerized by the screen. Merrill kneels down on the floor beside them. Looking up at Merrill. Pale with worry, Morgan turns back to the TV. Graham is now in the room. He moves to a window, which is being partially boarded up on the inside and peers out. He then takes a plank of old wood and secures it over the window, blocking out the light completely. Outside, the silver pipes of a wind chime knock against each other. Then, more chimes are disturbed by the strengthening breeze. Graham sits indoors in dim lights, staring and failing me ahead. Merrill sauces into the room and stops next to Morgan and Bo, who are standing against a wall. Graham nods. Graham smiles. Graham turns to look at his brother. Graham beams. His lips spread into a smile. Later, in the dimly little kitchen, pans and bowls, one full of empty eggshells, are stacked up into two sinks. On a worktop lies a sharp knife along with a skinned onion, some potato peel on top of tomato. Graham, Merrill, and the two children sit silently at the dinner table in the next room. Shifting awkwardly in his chair, Graham casts a fleeting glance at the others. Graham's taken aback. Graham's lips trembles slightly. Morgan's eyes are swollen. He reaches over and stabs his fork into a piece of molten toast, then, sits back down. Merrill watches in disbelief as Graham tucks into his mount of food. Bo sitting next to him in tears. Upset, Graham winces as he eats. Observing him, Morgan gets up from his chair and goes to his dad who is now throwing down his fork and is sobbing uncontrollably. Morgan leans into his father who hugs him tightly, then, pulls Bo to his other side. Merrill is staring self-consciously at his plate when Graham's hand reaches out, and tucks him in the family embrace. Graham's body rocks as he cries. At the other end of the table, the red lines on the baby monitor begin to flash.",
    "628": "Graham and his family look up and stare. Graham walks slowly across the polished wooden floor into the front hallway, reaches the door to the cupboard under the stairs, and pulls it open. He looks at the TV set inside, which is displaying a test card. He turns to look back at the others and swallows. Later, Merrill is upstairs, hammering boards over the door to the children's bedroom. Across the landing in his room, Graham cautiously approaches the window and looks out over the maize field. His eyes widening and becoming fixed in a fearful stare, he backs towards the bedroom door. Merrill looks over at him. Eyes still on the window, Graham sidles out of the room and closes the door. Graham lifts up a plank and holds it across the door. Merrill takes the other end. Together, the two men hammered nails through the plank into the door frame. Bo, with Morgan standing at the top of the stairs behind them, watches. Turning to get another nail, Graham stops and stares at Bo before helping Merrill with another plank. Bo remains motionless, clinging to her brother. Bo walks over. He crouches down. She shakes her head. Bo grins at him. He strokes her cheek. Graham pulls her towards him. He picks his daughter up. Merrill slaps another plank across the bedroom door. Bo in his arms, Morgan goes downstairs into the front hallway. Graham and Merrill put the children down. They stop and listen. They all stare in the direction of the barking beyond the wooden mantle piece which stands at the far end of the room. Two China dogs sit on it, one on each side, illuminated by the dim glow of two wall lamps above them. Graham's eyes dart nervously around. His fingers tighten on Bo's shoulders in front of him. He and Merrill exchange anxious glances. They look towards a boarded up window to the right of the mantle piece, their gaze passing across the fireplace as they turn to follow the noises. Shadows flit across the slit of moonlight between two planks across the window on the left of the mantle piece. Slowly, the family turns to watch the figures block out the soft light diffusing through the gaps between the boards on another window at the front of the house. They swing around and stare petrified down the hallway and into the kitchen towards the backdoor. They turn quickly back around to look at the front door, one plank nailed across the frame halfway up. The doorknob turns. Morgan starts to back away. Graham looks around and puts a comforting hand on Morgan's shoulder before kneeling down in front of the frightened boy. Graham smiles lovingly as a tear falls from Morgan's eyes.",
    "629": "Merrill stares wearily up the staircase, climbing the first two steps. He gazes in horror at the unsecured hatch door in the attic. Merrill and Graham pull the children down the hallway into the kitchen. Morgan's terrified eyes focus on the gap at the bottom of the front door as green gray fingers appear underneath it. Graham hurries down some stairs into the gloomy basement and slams the door shut. He turns suddenly and presses his ear against the door, his hands pushing against it, its olive green paint peeling. He looks down at the doorknob, grabs it as it starts to turn, and holds it tight with both hands, resting his head on the door. Merrill spots a pickaxe and as he yanks it off a high shelf, he smashes the light bulb, plunging the basement into darkness. Morgan turns on a torch and stares down into its bright beam before looking around and pointing it at the door. Graham and Merrill push hard against it, the pickaxe now firmly wedged under the doorknob. Graham turns to put his back against the door and shields his eyes from the bright torch beam. Morgan slowly directs the torch beam around the basement and starts to walk past a cluttered work bench. The light falls on Bo, crouched on the floor. She waves lamely at Morgan. Merrill finds another flashlight and directs its beam around the walls of the basement, illuminating old wooden shelves, supporting neatly-arranged pickling jars, bowls, ski boots, roller skates, and disordered clutter. He spots a dusty old radio on one shelf and turns the dial on the front. They went around to face the door. Graham pushes his hand against the door lit by Morgan's torch. He then turns to face the others. The pickaxe holds in place as the door is hit. Graham stares thoughtfully at the door. Morgan sets the white-headed silver torch on the ground and rolls it across to his father. Merrill walks over to Graham. Graham and Merrill move slowly in different directions, working their way around the rough stone walls. A dry and faded flowery hangs on a hook. A wire-framed basket hangs on another peg. They come towards each other again. Their torch beams pick up the coal shoot with roll turning grill across it and Morgan standing in front of it. Merrill and Graham stand and stare at him, stunned. A clawed hand pokes through the grill and grabs Morgan's throat. Graham drops his torch as he rushes to rescue his son. As he runs away from the coal shoot, he kicks the torch which rolls around to pick out Bo's legs, poking out from beneath her silky blue dress as she presses herself up against the wall.",
    "630": "She walks over to the torch, picks it up, and shines it at Merrill, who's stacking crates and live sacks of dog food in front of the chute. He slides wearily down his barricade to the ground. Spotting a can of dog food on the floor, he picks it up and rising slightly, reaches up beside him to slap it on top of the pile of sacks. Sitting back down on the floor, he looks across at Bo, and then, picks up his torch, using it to search the basement for the others. The beam illuminates his brother, Graham, sitting on the floor, leaning against a pillar. Morgan, sitting between Graham's legs, his head pushed back into his father's chest. Merrill's eyes widened in alarm. Graham has one hand on Morgan's chest, the other gripping his son's shoulder. Bo stares at them wide-eyed. Graham rests his head against Morgan's. Bo goes to sit on Merrill's lap, tears welling in her eyes. Morgan holds the knees of his father's jeans tightly as he struggles with his breathing. Graham lifts his head slightly and stares angrily into the distance. His lips quiver. Merrill wheels Morgan on, mouthing silent words of earnest prayer. Morgan relaxes his grip on his father's jeans. Morgan lies back, his breathing returning to normal. Merrill stares across at them, blinking rapidly. He swallows. He turns his torch off. Bo turns hers off. In Graham's mind, he reaches the scene of the accident. Caroline talks to him. He stares at the ground. His lips trembling. Caroline nods. She smiles bleakly. Graham walks slowly past a police car and a huddle of policemen standing over Ray who's sitting on the ground head bowed. A little way beyond is Ray's Ford pickup truck smashed into the tree, stretched into any of the front and a couple of paramedics standing by. They turned to look at Graham as he approaches. Back in the basement, the main light is on. Graham looks up. Merrill walks over to the radio. Graham stares blearily down at the floor. Graham looks up at Merrill in shock. Graham gets to his feet and takes a step towards his brother. Graham looks reflectively down at the ground. Merrill regards him accusingly. Graham frowns and shakes his head. Merrill steps towards him. Graham nods numbly, his mouth agape. They turn to look at Morgan asleep on the floor, his head resting on folded blankets. Graham glances at the door. Suddenly, thinking of something, Graham walks over to Morgan, and crouching down, lifts up the back of the boy's beige and brown check shirt. Graham glances up in relieved surprise. And pulls the baby monitor out of the back pocket of Morgan's jeans.",
    "632": "Graham stares into her eyes and nods. Graham's eyes fill with tears as he reaches out to take her hand in his. Graham stares at her, puzzled, through his wet eyes. Her head lowers. Graham remembers his conversation with Merrill. His eyes glazed with tears, Graham stares at the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm. Graham turns slowly from the creature to face Merrill, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien. Merrill remains motionless. Merrill turns his gaze from the creature to Graham. And then looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him. Its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets. Merrill takes the bat down. The alien lowers its hand over Morgan's face. A gray gash shooting from the spike and into Morgan's nose. The alien turns. Merrill launches himself at the creature, striking it in the back. The alien drops Morgan. And turns back to face his assailant. Graham rushes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe. Merrill strikes the creature in its abdomen. It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water. As the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green gray skin. Merrill and Graham stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water. Graham turns to Bo in astonishment. And then hurries outside with Morgan in his arms. Bo following him. On the veranda, Bo looks back into the living room through a broken window as Graham heads out onto the lawn. Merrill swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table. The alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid. Crouched on the lawn, Graham, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe. And then, thrusts it into Morgan's leg. Merrill prepares for another strike. He slams the bat into the alien. The creature topples over, landing on his back and knocking against a small sideboard. Glasses on the sideboard tip over. Water cascading down onto the crib. The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, shards of glass around it. The alien takes deep, difficult breaths. The alien's chest sinks and fails to rise. Merrill hurries out into the garden and crouches down by Graham and Morgan. Graham, his eyes closed, cradles his limp son. Merrill presses Morgan's neck and recoils. Merrill turns away. Bo's face creases as she begins to sob. Graham opens his moistened eyes. His face shudders. Merrill swings round. Bo looks on in awe. Graham turns. Hardly daring to look at his son as Morgan lifts his head.",
    "633": "A path leads from the side of the circle, splitting into two prongs. A third crop circle has two straight lines at either side, and a circle of maize remaining in the center, with another path leading off from its side. It splits into three larger prongs, the central one of which points towards a smaller circle. Graham is on the phone as he looks out of his window at the yard. He bows his head, then steps into the kitchen. One of the dogs lies on the floor near a puddle of liquid. Morgan and Bo lead the Alsatian into the backyard. Graham crosses the kitchen and pulls some paper towels off a roll. He dabs at the urine, saturating the towels, then stands and walks back across the kitchen. A dark haired woman in a police uniform leans casually in a doorway leading to the front hall. Carolyn sighs wearily and gazes at Graham. In the yard, Morgan's at the smoking barbecue. He sticks a fork in a chicken wing and turns it over. One of the Alsatians watches Morgan from the veranda. The other one, Houdini, lies slumped in the yard with Bo kneeling in front of him. Morgan walks across to Bo as she drinks from a large glass of water. Morgan kneels beside his sister and drinks from the tall glass. He gives her the glass. Bo carefully pours the water into a metal dog bowl and slides it across the grass to Houdini. The Alsatian suddenly jerks his head up towards Bo. Bo jumps back in shock and Morgan frowns. Bo stands. Houdini stands up and Bo freezes. The stalks all lie in the same direction. Graham shakes his head. She looks across the field. Graham stares thoughtfully into space. He rises and slowly walks towards the edge of the circle. Caroline stands and watches him with a slightly puzzled expression. Graham gazes across the field. Graham and Caroline emerge through the tall green crop and look around anxiously. Graham spots something over to his left and strides briskly towards it with a concerned expression. Caroline follows him and they break into a jog. Houdini lies motionless on the ground near the climbing frame, with Morgan kneeling beside him. The barbecue fork sticks out of Houdini's throat. Morgan holds an asthma inhaler as he stares down at the dog. Morgan looks up at his father through puffy red eyes. Bo sits up on a platform on the climbing frame, with her knees drawn tightly up to her chin. She wears blue sneakers and jeans under her pale flowery dress. Morgan looks back down and takes a puff of his inhaler. Graham stares at his son and crouches down beside Houdini.",
    "634": "Morgan takes Graham's hand and steps over Houdini, then they gaze down at the dead dog. Graham puts his hand on Morgan's shoulder, but Morgan brushes it away and trudges off solemnly. Graham steps up to the climbing frame and looks searchingly at Bo, who remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground. Graham gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder, then carries her back to the farmhouse as Merrill emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed. Graham walks past him and climbs onto the veranda, walking through the front door of the house. Merrill looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression. He's in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face. Merrill puts down the bag of feed and unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from the veranda steps, then leads her across the yard as Caroline pulls the barbecue fork from Houdini's throat. A wire wind chime in the shape of a beaming sun hangs on the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze. That night the farmhouse stands in darkness beneath a black sky. Graham lies on his side in bed, his eyes suddenly open and he stares ahead. Bo gazes at him. Graham pads across the landing to the children's bedroom, holding Bo by the hand. They come to the open bedroom door and step into the darkened room, where Morgan lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable looking heap. Bo shuffles off to her bed as Graham gently lifts Morgan up and lies him on his back. Graham walks across the bedroom and sits beside Bo on her bed, gazing at her and looking her up and down. Bo looks at him through wide bright eyes, and a sadness falls across Graham's face. Graham looks at his daughter, then glances over at the bedroom window, seeing a shadowing figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof. Graham jumps to his feet. Downstairs in the lounge, Merrill's asleep in an armchair. Graham touches his shoulder and Merrill wakes, looking up at his brother in confusion. Graham and Merrill are by the front door. Merrill opens the door and an outside light comes on. They rush out and split up. Merrill comes to the back of the house as a dust bin's tipped over up ahead. Graham runs along the side of the house. The brothers meet up again at the front of the house, stopping and looking around breathlessly. A sound on the roof of the house attracts their attention. Merrill keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, and tries to get a better view.",
    "636": "Graham's silver station wagon drives along the freeway and passes a large modern church. The station wagon parks beside other vehicles outside a parade of shops, and the family gets out. Merrill feeds the parking meter while Morgan holds his hand out to Graham. Graham hands Morgan some cash, and Morgan and Bo head off down the sidewalk together. Graham watches them as Morgan holds out his hand and Bo takes it. Graham turns and calls to Merrill, who strolls off in the other direction. Morgan is in a bookshop watching news coverage with the middle-aged proprietors. A radio is on in a pharmacy as Graham waits at the counter. The young shop assistant comes to the counter with a paper prescription bag and leans pensively on the counter. Tracy's face crumples, and Graham looks awkward. Merrill is in an army recruitment center looking at posters. A gray-haired man in a sergeant's uniform sits at a desk with a poster of Uncle Sam behind him. Merrill turns to the sergeant. Cunningham stares up at Merrill. Merrill gazes apprehensively down at Cunningham, then laughs. He gives Merrill a pamphlet. Merrill stares at Cunningham and nods. A scruffy young man is filling out a form. Lionel smirks. He has stubble on his chin and wears a t-shirt and sleeveless biker jacket. Merrill folds up the pamphlet, puts it in his pocket, and walks solemnly towards the door. He stops just behind Lionel, jerks as though about to hit him, and Lionel flinches. Merrill leaves. In the bookshop, Bo sits at a table and sips a glass of water. A cola commercial comes on TV. Morgan holds the book out to the lady. In the pharmacy, Tracy thinks. Merrill, Morgan, and Bo are already eating in a pizza restaurant when Graham comes in and sits at their table. The other three nod. Graham sighs, nods back, and glances out of the restaurant doorway. His expression hardens when he sees a young dark-haired man of Asian descent strolling down the sidewalk and opening the back door of a brown Chevrolet four by four. Morgan follows his father's gaze and looks out of the doorway at the man. Merrill also gazes out at the young man. Graham and his family stare fixedly out at the young man, who shuts his car door and glances over at the restaurant. He sees the family gazing back at him and his mouth opens in surprise. Graham takes a deep breath. The young man looks unsettled as he gets into his driver's seat and fires up the engine. The four by four swings out of its parking bay and accelerates off down the road. Graham turns back to the table and takes a bite of pizza while Merrill, Morgan, and Bo continue looking out at the street.",
    "639": "Morgan fetches a video. Graham stares wide-eyed at the screen. Now seated, Morgan uses his inhaler. He's beside Merrill. Bo's at the other end of the sofa beside her dad. All four of them are hypnotized by the TV on which sit two glasses of water. Later, with the lights out, Graham and Merrill are still transfixed. The children are sleeping. He stares ahead. He meets Merrill's gaze. Merrill looks away. Merrill's smile fades. And Graham looks somber. Uneasy, Merrill ponders this. Then, recalls something. And his face brightens a little. He grins. Graham watches the TV. Merrill looks at Graham, then, nods. Graham shoots a knowing glance at this brother, who looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV. Graham stares vacantly. His eyes meet with Merrill's. Merrill shakes his head. With conviction in his eyes, he stares piercingly at Merrill. He looks almost angry. His features taut and his eyes glistening, Graham turns to face the TV. Merrill looks down thoughtfully. Then he too faces the TV. And they watch together. Their expressions blank as if in a trance. Now, a fresh-faced Graham, dressed in black, and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night. Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash. And Caroline stands in the road, waving her arms above her head. His face long, Graham pulls to a stop and climbs out. Caroline walks up to meet him. Graham wakes up on the sofa. And his glazed eyes scan the room. Light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room. Graham heaves himself into a sitting position. And stays there for a while without moving. He then spots a black cable snaking across the polished dark wood floor. Hoisting himself slowly to his feet, he follows the cable across the room and into the hallway. The lead runs into a closet under the stairs. And Graham opens the door to find a bleary eyed Merrill sitting perfectly still, staring fixedly at the TV. He looks up, a little surprised. Uncomfortable, Graham goes. The doors shut. Later, Graham, wearing a blue dressing gown, pads out of the bathroom, drying his ear with a towel. Frowning, he goes to a window and looks down into the empty garden, with its swings, climbing frame and picnic bench. Hearing the voice, Graham raises his eyebrows. Then, walks along the landing and into the children's room. Morgan and Bo are sitting on a bed, wearing pointy cone shaped hats made of silver foil. They look up. Morgan's holding open a book. Bo points to her hat. Graham enters and sits down between his children on the bed. He peers down at Morgan's book. Morgan closes the book.",
    "64": "He stops cold, then swearing and choking, pulls himself out of the rushing water using the fence. Drenched and battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car. He fishes for his car keys and looks down, noticing one shoe is missing. As he starts to get into his car, Mulvihill and a smaller man stop him. Mulvihill pulls his coat down, pinning his arms and holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up his left nostril. Frozen, with the knife in his nostril and the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade, he screams as the smaller man pulls back on the blade, laying his left nostril open about an inch further. Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat. He bends over, trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him as he grovels on his hands and knees. He sees his tormentor's two-tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood. The smaller man shoves him into the ground and the sound of footsteps retreating is heard as he gasps. Later, he sits behind his desk, not moving, while Duffy stares at nothing and Walsh moves uneasily around the room. He turns slowly to Walsh, taps his nose, and looks irritated. He picks up the phone, and Walsh starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story. Walsh finishes the punch line and both men laugh raucously. He drops the mail he's been looking through and puts his hand over the receiver, looking to his two men. He flips through the paper until he finds the obituary column, scans it, tears it from the paper, and puts it in his pocket. Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He rises and allows her to sit. She's wearing dove gray gabardine and the waiter appears. Evelyn looks at his nose, then down, smoothing her gloves. When she looks back up, she stares expectantly at him. He pulls out a torn envelope and fingers it, coughing and smiling. He looks significantly at Evelyn, who is clearly angry but controlling it. This subdues him a little, as Evelyn is still heated but appears embarrassed for the first time. She looks squarely at him and he nods, still fingering the envelope. Evelyn turns into him as he leans on the open door of his car and talks quietly but spits it out.",
    "642": "Jamal and Latika stare at each other. The guard presses the intercom, then approaches to open the gates. Latika quickly moves inside the house. Jamal enters an expensively furnished marble living room. He sees Latika behind the glass partition separating the room from a kitchen and approaches. She removes her dark glasses and stands expectantly as he steps from behind the partition. They both stand stock still. She takes a sharp intake of breath. She smiles as he moves towards her then they embrace each other tightly. Suddenly, she looks scared and backs away. He looks at her shocked. A silver Mercedes pulls up to the house. As Javed steps into the living room, Latika puts an apron over Jamal's neck. Javed walks straight into the kitchen and levels his malevolent gaze at Latika. He points to the game show on TV. He walks into the living room and sits down in front of a widescreen TV. He switches on the cricket game. Latika nervously prepares a sandwich for Javed. Jamal spreads a concoction of preservatives onto a slice of bread as Latika dumps a limp piece of lettuce on the plate. Jamal and Latika exchange nervous glances. He grabs her hand. She breaks his hold, lifts the plate, and takes it to Javed. She passes in front of the TV and Javed shoos her out of the way back to the kitchen. Javed watches the game. He throws his drink. Jamal looks pleadingly at Latika. Javed, still transfixed by the cricket game, takes a bite of his sandwich. He looks disgusted and spits it out onto the plate. He walks into the kitchen. He glares at Jamal. He goes back to the cricket, swearing under his breath. Latika pushes Jamal toward the door. She slowly shakes her head. She pushes him out of the door. He remains in the courtyard looking back at her. Jamal takes a deep breath and raises his eyes upwards. The cricket match replays. He tenses his jaw muscles then hands back the check to the host. Jamal looks out of a train window as it races through the city. The train pulls into a large station. He jumps off. Hundreds of passengers alight from the train and throng on the platforms. An enormous station clock shows five minutes to five. Now the clock shows five-fifteen. As Jamal moves along the walkway looking down on the platform, he scans the busy platforms and looks at the overhead clock. He rests his head on his hands in despair then he squats down. Latika appears on the platform. She's looking around her. Jamal looks up and catches sight of her. He stands up immediately. She looks very anxious.",
    "646": "Jamal's mother screams at the boys as the attackers bludgeon defenseless men and women. Jamal watches as his mother is clubbed in the face and falls back into the water. The boys help each other out of the pool and run, but Jamal looks back for his mother while Salim urges him onward. A man falls and is stamped on by a mob as they run past another man throwing a Molotov cocktail at a door. Jamal and Salim flee down an alley and come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama, covered in blue paint with his hair bound up on his head. They both run, passing the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley. A man sets another man on fire as the boys run towards a police station, but Latika falls behind. The policemen are playing cards and do nothing as a man runs out into the street with his clothes in flames. The boys run again, beckoning to Latika to follow. Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool. Present day, back in the police station, Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama. The boys are frozen to the spot momentarily and stare at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand. Jamal, on the show, is lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots, with Latika standing some distance away from the boys. Latika stands in the street drenched in the torrential rain as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter. Salim rolls onto his side, and Jamal looks out at Latika in the rain for a moment then lies down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode. Jamal wakes up, and Salim lies with his back to Jamal, but he's wide awake. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street, and she squats down tracing letters in the puddles. Jamal calls out to her, and she stands up, runs over to the shelter, and squats down next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head, and Salim's eyes are still wide open. Latika lies down next to Jamal, and the three children lie on the floor out of the rain shivering in the cold. Present day, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host. People scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish as lorries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal in the studio looks pensive. On the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick and looks up when a minibus arrives. She turns and shouts as two men emerge from the minibus and approach a makeshift tent. Two pairs of feet they count, as Jamal and Salim lie dosing in the tent amidst the rubbish.",
    "647": "Maman, the smaller man, kneels at the entrance and strokes Salim's foot. He wakes up and hands him a Coke. Jamal also wakes up and is given a Coke. Maman pats him on the back, smiling all the way. The boys grin and gulp down the drinks. The minibus is driving through lush countryside, full of scruffy street kids gazing out of the windows. The bus arrives at a large dilapidated residence where numerous children of all ages run around playing in the yard. Some children move around on crutches, while others play on swings. Salim smiles and the children on the bus jump around excitedly. Maman watches as the children are fed a hot meal. Jamal catches Maman staring at the new arrivals. Evening, Maman has lined up the new children before him. He closes his eyes and listens to Arvind, then pats him on the head. Arvind moves back in line. Salim steps out to sing. Maman screws up his face and buries his head in his hands. He strikes Latika, then punches Punnoose's thighs as Maman laughs. Everyone laughs. Next day, Salim sits with Punnoose in the bus, intently watching a group of kids on a Mumbai street. Salim approaches the gang of children and claps his hands. Jamal stops playing and watches his brother. Salim slaps the giggling child, then stalks around malevolently. The child refuses so Salim snatches the baby from her. He pretends to drop the baby in front of Latika. The gang of children run out into the busy street. Some limp with crutches, others have missing hands. The children shake containers at people begging for money or food. Latika wears an eye patch and begs at a stationary car window. Midnight at Maman's compound. Jamal points at some dried chillies. Latika, wearing rubber gloves, picks up a fist full of chillies and crushes them in her palms. She sneaks into the dormitory where all the children are sleeping on the floor and finds Salim sleeping naked under a thin sheet. She carefully stuffs the chilies over his groin. Punnoose dozes, oblivious. Latika sneaks off back to her side of the dormitory. Salim suddenly jerks awake and dashes to the tap. He douses his groin in cold water. Punnoose wakes up and points at Latika. Jamal and Latika giggle and smile at each other. A bearded henchman lights a candle as Arvind sings for Maman. Maman holds up his hand. Punnoose shakes a bottle into a cloth then quickly smothers Arvind's face with the cloth. Salim looks on, eyes wide, mouth agape. Arvind collapses and Punnoose lifts his limp body to a table. Salim obeys. The bearded man burns a sizzling liquid in a spoon over the flame.",
    "651": "The boys burst into the room. Jamal stares dumbfounded at Latika. She smiles in recognition. Maman and his henchmen stand at the door. Punnoose's face is now badly scarred. She avoids Maman's eyes but doesn't move. He reaches over and grabs her roughly. Salim draws a revolver from behind his back and points it at the men. Jamal looks astonished at his brother. Maman draws closer. Maman leers at Salim. Salim places a cushion over the gun. Jamal recoils in horror. And the men tremble. Latika rushes to take Maman's money from the floor. Jamal is rooted to the spot. The three children flee the scene. On the game show, Jamal looks deep in thought. The host points his hand at Jamal mimicking holding a gun. The scene of Maman's death replays. The host looks down at his computer screen. Young Salim, Jamal, and Latika sneak past the sleeping guard and break into a brand new but unoccupied hotel. They run up a deceased elevator into an atrium door with an enormous gold chandelier. Inside the hotel room, Salim gleefully pours two bottles of spirit into a pot while Jamal picks a towel out of a cupboard. Jamal shakes the dusty towel and takes it to the bathroom door. Salim gulps down some beer. Salim suddenly looks solemn and leaves the room. Salim steps out onto the street. Jamal has his eyes closed and head turned away from a semi-naked Latika. She smiles as he squeezes his eyes tightly shut. She goes back into the bathroom. He keeps his eyes closed for a moment more then slowly opens them. Salim crosses a road busy with tuk-tuks, cars, bicycles, and carts. He approaches a cinema kiosk, hands over a coin, and receives the ticket. On a large balcony above the cinema, six men are drinking and playing a gambling game. None of the men notices Salim as he steps onto the balcony and swaggers over. They ignore Salim as he takes out his gun from behind his back. He points it at one of the men's heads. Salim slowly turns to face Javed, he nods. Javed beckons to Salim. In the hotel room, Jamal and Latika lie on a mattress on the floor. Latika makes graceful hand shadows on the wall. Her arms are painted in intricate gold and henna designs. They stare at each other for a long time. Salim returns to the room. Jamal and Latika snoozing on the mattress. Salim stands over Latika. Both Latika and Jamal wake up. He holds out his hand for Latika. He leans towards Latika. Jamal rushes Salim. Salim eventually overpowers the smaller Jamal and ejects him from the room. Salim emerges, pointing a gun.",
    "655": "The balcony starts to collapse, and Peter's webs pull two people away from falling masonry. MJ is stranded on a swaying piece of balcony. Peter runs through the crowd and pulls at his clothes, revealing the Spider-Man costume underneath. A pillar crashes into a police car. The glider returns to the balcony, and the Green Goblin holds a pumpkin bomb which incinerates the board members. Harry is hit by a piece of masonry and knocked out. The Green Goblin glides up, and Spider-Man swoops down, kicking the goblin from the glider. The goblin lands on top of a marquee, and the glider shoots through a hot air balloon and out the other side. A little boy is rooted to the spot as the world unity festival hoarding falls towards him, but Spider-Man rescues him. Police converge on the Green Goblin, but the goblin easily punches the cops. Spider-Man swings in front of him and throws a punch, but the goblin catches his hand and kicks Spider-Man in the chest, propelling him backwards. Spider-Man comes to a stop with a lamp post, which crashes onto a passerby. The goblin leaps back onto the glider, which is fitted with guns, and pursues the running Spider-Man, firing at him. A missile just misses Spider-Man who leaps onto a large inflatable. Hearing MJ's screams, Spider-Man leaps from inflatable to inflatable and uses one like a trampoline. Just as he bounces towards the balcony, the Green Goblin on the glider grabs him from behind, crashing him against the stained glass window and smashing his head repeatedly against it. Spider-Man elbows the goblin in the face then breaks free. The two fight until Spider-Man falls to MJ. The goblin descends on the glider, and Spider-Man shoots a web into the goblin's face. Spider-Man cuts an electric car cell from the underside of the glider. As the goblin escapes, MJ falls from the balcony. Spider-Man dives after MJ as she plummets towards the ground and catches her in his arm. The web attached to the balcony holds just as near the other ground and they spring back up in the air. Spider-Man swings her to safety to the upper floors of the crowds below. They continue on, high above the streets of Manhattan as people stand and stare. MJ, her arms wrapped tightly around Spider-Man, looks around in wonder and awe both at the experience and with him. He swings past the twin spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and land on the Rockefeller Center roof garden nearby to the surprise of a canoodling couple. He makes to go and somersaults off the roof. MJ rushes over to see him swinging back and forth on the streets.",
    "657": "She grins broadly as she stands in the pouring rain, looking up into the sky. They kiss, a long, lingering kiss as she leans forward and cups his face with her hands. The rain is still falling around them. She places her fingertips on the roll of the mask and tugs it back into place. He shoots out a web and pulls himself up. The next day is clear and bright, the sun shining over the skyscrapers of Manhattan. Fire trucks surround a burning apartment building. Flames are roaring out of the top floors. Firemen are evacuating the building's occupants. A woman runs to them. Spider-Man is zooming along the streets, leaping from web to web way above the traffic. He swings from a lamp stand in front of the burning building and leaps in through a window on the lowest of the floors, which is alight. He disappears from the view of those on the ground. A fireman, his face and outfit blackened, stands by the mother, whose hands are closed as if in prayer. They all are calm. Spider-Man reappears at the second explosion. He lands on the sidewalk, baby in arms. The mother pulls back the shawl. A policeman races up. The policeman scrutinizes Spider-Man. Spider-Man hauls himself back up to the top of the building and bursts in through a window. He looks around the blazing inferno. Part of the ceiling caves in. He sees a figure in the distance. He reaches out for the figure, who spins round. It's the Green Goblin. One punch sends Spider-Man sprawling. He throws an orange ball. It explodes into several spinning boomerang type blades. They head for Spider-Man, who leaps acrobatically to avoid them. As he jumps, ducks and weaves, so the Goblin attacks with his gloved fists. Spider-Man fights back and still has to deflect the rotating blades. One cuts his left arm. In a limber darting move, arching his back, Spider-Man avoids another blade. He whips back up, smashes the Goblin in the face, pulls him back with a webbed thread and then volleys him with his left foot through a partition. Using the explosion as cover, Spider-Man beats a hasty retreat. Norman's eyes glaze on his way up to Harry's apartment. Harry and Aunt May are tidying up and MJ has a sniff of a casserole. They hear the elevator gate. Aunt May opens the door. Spider-Man lands outside on his room's window ledge. Harry hears the sound. Norman eyes up MJ. Aunt May calls upstairs. They're all gathered in the living room by the bottom of the stairs. Aunt May starts to make her way up. He whips off his mask.",
    "66": "The Clerk turns away abruptly, then hauls down the northwest valley volume and opens it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through. The print itself makes him squint, showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved, e.g., '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded. In the owners' column, however, there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners. The Clerk turns sharply around. Gittes looks a little surprised. The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk. Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically. Beside the OWNER column, he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the sound of the paper being ripped. Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads, Gittes parks at the edge of the field. Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet. Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply. Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer. The paper's on the ground. He picks it up. The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt. Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened-in porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog. He's got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots. He looks out. Gittes says nothing. Evelyn driving. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, takes one, offers one to Evelyn who refuses. It's almost evening. He pulls out the obituary column he'd folded up earlier in the day.",
    "662": "On the monitor behind Peter in the Genetic Research Institute, the DNA of a new species of spider like the one which bit Peter is displayed. A man in a green, flight suit is standing on a levitating glider. Norman turns to Strom. The general walks away, leaving a pensive Norman. Inside a suburban house, Peter's Uncle Ben is changing a light bulb. Leaving his concerned aunt and uncle downstairs, Peter absently makes his way upstairs to his room. He strips off his shirt and vest. His skinny frame wavering in front of a tall mirror. He collapses on his bed then rolls off onto the floor. He grabs the tartan blanket lying on top of the bed and hauls it over him. Flashing through Peter's mind are the spiders, the DNA, the helix being split and another part being fused in sending a surge of power through the rest. At Oscorp, Norman strips to the waist and takes bottle from Strom. He gulps down its contents. Having flung the bottle to the floor, Norman lifts opens the metal with strengths on the sliding trolley and lies down on it. Strom fastens the manacles over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms. Norman is firmly attached to the trolley. The grim-faced Strom hurries over to a control panel. The trolley glides into a large, glass chamber. The doors slide closed. Once inside, the trolley raises from a horizontal position to a vertical one. Norman all the while firmly locked into it. Strom looks on. Norman nods to his colleague. Pushing another switch, Strom watches as a large file containing a green liquid empties. Vapor rises in the chamber. The green vapor engulfs Norman. Strom watches a computer generated image of the level of the green gas in the chamber as it rises to fill it. He then looks at another screen monitoring Norman's physiology. The heart rate increases reaching 140. Norman's body is convulsing. Strom runs to the panel. He starts venting the gas chamber. Norman's head shakes and only the whites of his eye show. The convulsing stops but Norman is held upright by the restraints. He flat lines. Strom enters the chamber. He attempts heart massage standing up. The pulse returns. Norman's eyes flash over. He grabs Strom by the throat. He flings Strom through the glass of the chamber. Now freed, Norman leaps out strong. Peter wakes from his fitful sleep and picks himself up off the floor. Peter reaches for his spectacles. He puts them on, then quickly takes them off. He tries again and once more removes them. He holds them up in front of his face. When he looks through them everything is blurred. When he moves them away his vision is clear.",
    "664": "Flash glares. As Peter walks out of the swing doors, the tray is trapped on the swing shot. Later, Peter strides towards his locker, examining his wrist as he goes. Flash marches after him, pushing students out of his way. Peter stands staring at his unopened locker. He hears a paper airplane zooming down the corridor towards a fly hovering by the fire alarm bell. In slow motion, he hears a spit word being propelled from a blow pipe, then a fist. He swerves to his side as Flash's punch lands on the locker door. Flash, even with his left hand, aims two punches at Peter who ducks and weaves out of the way. Then in slow motion, Flash throws another punch which Peter just swerves away from. Then a punching flurry. Peter arches his back as they are doing a limbo dance and evades it. To avoid Flash's colleague, Peter flips into the air, somersaults, and lands on his feet. Flash charges again but fails to connect. Peter grabs his arm, then he punches Flash. Then he slides on his back down the corridor, collides with a teacher carrying the tray, and ends up with more food on him. MJ looks at him in wonder. Flash's crony is there. Harry seems awestruck. MJ is unsure. And Peter looks confused and a little frightened. He races off. Peter runs across a street intersection and comes to a gateway leading into an alley. He stops out of sight of the passersby on the sidewalk and scrutinizes his wrist where the web shot from. He then turns over his hand to examine again the swollen bite mark. He looks up and sees a spider's web woven round the coils of barbed wire above the gateway entrance. He moves his hands closer to his face. On the pads of his fingertips, barbed bristles are beginning to grow. Peter stares at the brick building behind him. Then one after the other, places his hand on the surface and starts to climb. With competitive ease, Peter scales the high-sided brick building, his fingertips almost sticking to the surface as he makes his way out. Halfway up he stops and looks down. Peter is running across the roofs of tall buildings and leaping across the gaps between them. Two children playing with a skipping rope are oblivious as Peter launches himself into the air way above their heads. He lands on another roof and comes to a halt at the edge. Once again, he scrutinizes his wrist. Opposite him and across the road is a crane. Peter thinks for a moment then shoots a web from his wrist to the crane. He thrusts his arm forward towards the jib.",
    "668": "Down below, the hijacked car takes a right, gliding behind him and sending water into the air. Still, the police pursued the stolen car. Up above, Spider-Man is gaining on. He comes lower and lower until he can leap out of the roof of his uncle's car. He punches through it. Spider-Man grabs hold of the carjacker, who pulls a gun. As gunshots pepper the roof of the car, Spider-Man leaps up to the roof of a passing truck. Balancing on both feet, he keeps his eyes firmly on the stolen car. A bridge moves ahead. Spider-Man vaults into the air, across the bridge, and lands back on the roof of the truck. Spider-Man throws himself onto the car's hood and punches through the windscreen. The car swerves, hits a bollard, then crashes into a set of iron gates. A posse of police cars builds up behind the smashed vehicle. The carjacker has made his escape from the vehicle and is creeping to a darkened warehouse. His gun is held shakily in his left hand. As he reloads his piece, a shadow looms above his head. He's been surrounded. He shoots at the moving shadow. Trying to run from it, he fails to see Spider-Man lowering himself for a better look. At a locked door, Spider-Man catches up with him. He smashes the car thief's head into the glass panels on the door then sends him flying across the room. The thief lunges with a knife. Spider-Man kicks it from his grasp. Balaclava off. Peter strides forward. Peter grabs the man by the lapel. It's the thief from the arena. He remembers only too well letting the man pass. He reflects on Uncle Ben lying on the ground then backs away. The thief raises his gun. He holds it to Peter's forehead. Peter knocks the hand away and twists the thief's arm. The gun drops. The thief staggers back and trips. A police spotlight illuminates a second floor window through which the thief has fallen. It moves down to pick out where he has landed face down. Peter gazes down from the darkness. The spotlight returns to the window. His features lit up, Peter turns in horror. Police swarm all over the warehouse. They creep forward, guns held in one hand and torch lights in the other. They reach the window to find no one there. Peter is sitting with his elbows resting on his knees out in the open air. A light breeze ruffling his short dark hair. His face sad had his eyes moist. Around and beneath him, the lights of New York. He opens the front door of his home. Inside, sitting in the darkness is Aunt May wrapped in her padded housecoat.",
    "670": "Against a moody blue sky with towering white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian-style robes holds aloft a shining torch. Pages of comic magazines appear, followed by a spider's web behind letters that break up and vanish from the screen. Images of the principal actors are shown, then Peter Parker with his new muscular body. He is seen as the prototype Spider-Man in a wrestling green cage. Peter does not stop a thief and then kneels by his dying uncle. The beginnings of the Spider-Man costume are seen, followed by more titles. Spider-Man stands over Norman Osborn as Harry walks into the room. Peter Parker is at his uncle Ben's graveside, then walks away from MJ in the graveyard. He gazes at a poster of MJ, the face of parfumerie Emma Rose. As a pizza boy, Peter gazes blankly. Traffic is at a standstill, and Peter, on his moped, weaves his way through cars and yellow cabs. A taxi pulls out in front of Peter, and another stops in front of him, causing him to swing around it. He sees the lights change and a bus passes in front. He looks up at the clock, and another minute ticks by. Now on foot, Peter runs into an alley, ripping off his crash helmet. A guy watches the alley entrance as out swings Spider-Man with the pizza. Soaring through the skyscrapers far above land, he spots two kids running onto the street with a huge truck coming their way. He tosses the pizzas and swings down to pluck the kids away from the truck, setting them gently on the ground. A man steps out onto a balcony and turns to see the pizzas on the balustrade. As the man teases out a slice of pizza, Spider-Man swishes past, grabbing the pizzas and landing on a building nearby. The man goes to eat the pizza slice as it's whipped from his hand by a web. Inside the building, a receptionist sits at a desk in a hallway with black-and-white checkered flooring. She looks around on hearing the noise and sees a cupboard door opening. From it emerges Peter, carrying the pizzas. The brooms in the cupboard fall out behind him. Chewing her gum intently, she watches as he struggles to push the mops and brushes back inside. With one final thrust, Peter pushes back the brooms and slams the door. He picks up the pizza boxes, then notices some spider's web stuck to the top. The receptionist eyes him curiously as he pulls the stretchy, silky substance off and stuffs it in the back pocket of his jeans. He strides up to the desk and lays the pizzas on it.",
    "671": "He raises a drink to his lips to find that it's already been drunk. He tips it upside down, and its little umbrella falls to the floor. Back inside, Harry staggers up to him. He slaps Peter's face a second time. Peter's head swings to one side, then he turns to face Harry. The two eyeball each other before Harry, tight-lipped, turns and walks away. Peter lowers his head. Her arms folded, MJ looks slightly flustered as the guests applaud. She opens the palm of her hand towards John and moves up to the podium to join him, watched by a stunned Peter. Peter raises the camera to his eye. The lights of the Empire State Building form the backdrop for Spider-Man to swing slowly and gently through the city. He stretches out his right hand and flexes his wrist. He tries again and again, then falls. He lands face down in a puddle. Rises, pulls off the mask then flexes his wrists. Still nothing happens. He studies his fingertips, then looks up at the building to his right. Standing alone in an alley, he moves to the building. Places his hands on its surface and starts to climb. He moves rapidly up the outside of the building, climbing with ease. He starts to slip down, then comes to a halt. Grasping for a handle, he slips back into the puddle. He shakes his wet hands and leans back against a rubbish skip. He notices a newspaper hanging over the side. He grabs it and screws up his eyes to try to read the headline and focus on the picture. In his room, he tosses it away. Looking dejected, Peter sits on his bed. He takes the back of his left hand up to his forehead and wipes his brow. Octavius is at the desk in his lab. The four mechanical limbs busying themselves around him. One holds a cigar to his mouth. Another lights it for him. Octavius raises the dark glasses he's wearing from his eyes. Puffs on the cigar, then blows the match. Louise and MJ in a shoe store. Peter's at his doctor being examined. He points to his head. The doctor nods, then heaves himself up onto the examination couch to sit beside Peter. He nods again, and Peter reflects. Peter sits in his room, his head against the wall. Big flashes illuminate the darkness. Peter's eyes are bright. Sitting in the front seat of a car, the old man holds out his hand. Peter looks at the hand, only inches from him. He purses his lips. His face screws up and his eyes flicker. He turns his gaze on Uncle Ben who stares right back at him, a sad expression on his face.",
    "672": "In his room, Peter stares at his own hand held out, his shadow thrown behind him onto the wall. He then lies back, resting on a pillow, and stares into space, his steely blue eyes bright and determined. Outside in a dark alley with ominous clouds in the sky, Peter stands with his Spider-Man costume held out in front of him. The wind ruffles his hair as he remains still for a moment before dropping the costume and walking down the alley, leaving the costume in a dust bin. The sun shines as Peter strides through the city with a jaunty gait, but he trips on the sidewalk. He awkwardly gets to his feet, reaches into his pocket, and puts on his spectacles before setting off again. At home, he tightens up a wheel on his moped and spins it, but the wheel rolls off the front forks and bounces out of the open window. He strolls away from a hot dog man and stands at the curve as cop cars, vans, and officers on foot race off in one direction. Peter eats his hot dog and sets off in the other direction. In his room, he studies and raises his hand, grinning proudly. On the campus, Doctor Connors races up to him, and Peter stops and smiles. At the theater, MJ is distracted when she sees Peter in the audience. He grins inanely, and she smiles sweetly, ignoring the prompt and turning to her costar. MJ and Peter walk down the street side-by-side, and Peter gazes at her earnestly before they both resume walking. He looks at her through doleful eyes, and she scrutinizes his features before turning away and crossing to a yellow cab. She opens the door of the cab and, before getting in, turns to look at him once more. Peter half smiles as MJ steps into the cab, shuts the door, and watches as the cab drives away. He slips on his spectacles. At the Bugle, a headline is being composed as Jameson, on the phone, pulls Spider-Man's mask from a bag, followed by the rest of the costume. The disgruntled garbage man goes, and Robbie fondles the mask. In his office, Jameson, in the Spider-Man costume but minus the mask, leaps onto his desk with a big cigar in his mouth and flexes his wrists as if shooting out webs. His staff peers in through the slatted blinds, and Robbie shakes his head. Two girls overtake Peter and giggle as he smiles and walks on past an alleyway. He sees two muggers attacking a dark-haired youth but turns his back away, leaving the muggers punching and kicking their fallen victim.",
    "675": "Peter blinks through his dark-rimmed spectacles. A lone figure stands on the flat roof of a tall Manhattan building, with four lanes of parked traffic down below and another flat-roofed building across from it. The figure is Peter, who strides away from the edge, then stops, his face full of resolve. Peter runs towards the edge, past a skylight, his face set in grim determination, jaw clenched, teeth gritted. He pumps his arms, increases his pace, and his stride lengthens. Pigeons take to the air as Peter passes, his eyes focused on where he's going. He flings both arms back, then thrusts them forward as he leaps off the roof. His arms and legs flailing, he soars through the air. A washing line breaks his fall, and he swings on it against the wall, then drops onto the roof of a car, rolls off it, and hits another vehicle. He lifts himself up, looks to see how far he's fallen, clutches his back, and hobbles between the cars and out of the alley parking lot, leaning on a parked car for support. John is at MJ's. MJ opens wedding acceptance cards, and John kisses her outstretched hand. She studies him closely as he lies on the sofa, turning over to tip his head back on a cushion. MJ, on her knees, leans over him, kissing him full on the lips, her head pointing the opposite way from his. He stretches out his left hand, holding her head still. MJ moves her head away, closing her mouth and her eyes, lost in memories. Her long hair trails down over his cheek until she pulls back, opening her mouth in a silent sigh, looking sad and reflective. MJ is sitting in a cafe with a glass front, leaning her head on her hand as Peter strolls in and sits opposite her. He looks down as she stares intently into his face, her eyes fixed on him, growing sad. He shakes his head, and MJ purses her lips, her eyes flitting left and right. His head shakes slightly as he gazes sorrowfully into her blue eyes, then looks at the table. She lowers her head, then raises it, tears welling in her eyes, her lips quivering. She leans forward, laying her hand on his, her engagement ring shining brightly. Peter looks up, surprised, his eyes moving up from her hand to her face. She stretches further across the table, her eyes closed, her lips offered to him. His eyes widen as a car comes flying towards the window.",
    "676": "A car crashes through and flies past Peter and MJ's heads, landing upside down in the middle of the cafe. Peter dives across the table, snatches MJ into his arms, and flings them both to the floor. Peter helps MJ to her feet as they hear thuds coming from outside. The ground shakes as Peter sees three-pronged pincers at the end of a mechanical limb approach the cafe, carrying Octavius. One of the limbs drags Peter to Octavius, and another removes Octavius' shades. The mechanical limb throws Peter across the cafe, slamming him against the back wall, surrounded by debris. Octavius smiles at MJ and, with her firmly in his grasp, uses the other three limbs to stride away. High in the air, with four limbs protruding from his metal spine, Octavius and the limbs stride over to a building and up its side, disappearing from view. Peter bursts from under the rubble, stands still for a moment, then runs out onto the street. Through his glasses, the outlines of people are fuzzy. He takes them off and can see perfectly. He slips them back on, then takes them off again, dropping them to the ground, a thick lens falling from the frame. Peter clenches his fist tightly, looks around, and then strides on. At the Bugle, Robbie walks into the editor's office, and Jonah's eyes grow weary. The Spider-Man costume hangs on the wall. He turns his back. Spider-Man swoops and soars through the streets of New York, speeding in a straight line using webs from his wrists for propulsion. As Spider-Man nears the Westside Tower, Octavius climbs up over its clock face. Spider-Man is on the flagpole at its peak. A limb clatters into it, and the two engage in hand-to-hand fighting. Spider-Man is thrown but grabs a clock hand. A limb knocks it off, and Spider-Man falls, flicking web balls off the face, then catching the falling hand with another web and flinging it up at Octavius. It embeds itself in the wall next to Octavius. Two limbs hold it apart, breaking it in half, then hurl both pieces at Spider-Man. A limb punches Spider-Man down. He attaches two webs over Octavius and pulls him down. Both men descend, locked together, crashing onto the roof of a passing train. They bounce along the carriage roofs as the train continues its way between the city buildings, and the two men rise and face each other.",
    "682": "Underwater, Octavius' body, with all four limbs still attached, floats downwards along with the sphere as the entire lab sinks below the surface of the river. High on a crane, Spider-Man has woven a web over which he crawls to MJ, lying beside her far above the river with the city lights twinkling below. She looks earnestly at him, and he stares back as she screws up her face, fighting back tears. Down below, a convoy of squad cars speeds towards the waterside. Up on the web, MJ turns to face Spider-Man once more, and he half-smiles. Later, he eases her down towards the ground with a lengthening string of web from his wrist. As MJ glides down, the convoy of cars draws closer, their lights flashing. The lead car turns left and stops, and the passenger door opens for John to step out and look up at the descending MJ. As she lands on the boat's bridge, John races towards her. She turns on hearing him approach, and John leaps from the pier onto the boat, then climbs the stairs as MJ descends towards him. Meeting in the middle, they hug tightly, and as John nuzzles her neck, MJ looks up to the crane where a distant figure squats in true Spider-Man pose. Peter slips on the mask, looks at the city, then back at MJ, before leaping into the night sky carried by a web. Tears trickle down MJ's face as she rests her head on John's shoulder. Meanwhile, Harry sits alone in the apartment, fondling the blade of the dagger intended to kill Spider-Man. Hearing a noise, he gets to his feet and takes a few paces forward to listen. A door opposite him swings open, and Harry looks anxiously around, staring up at the balcony surrounding the room. He turns to the full-length mirror and stares at his late father. Shaking his head, Harry flings the dagger at the mirror, crashing through his father's reflection to reveal a room beyond. Stupefied, Harry moves to the mirror doorway, avoiding the jagged pieces of broken mirror, and slides through into a brick chamber. Brushing aside cobwebs, he strides through and turns, catching sight of the Green Goblin's mask out of the corner of his eye. Harry crashes into a set of shelves filled with spherical bombs, seeing row upon row of the weapons his father once used. He then catches sight of a cylindrical vial containing a phosphorescent green liquid, picks it up, examines it, and marches into another section of the secret chamber.",
    "684": "A convertible smashes into a chasing police car, then heads straight for Peter. Peter leaps over the convertible, completes a backwards somersault and lands, poised. The car chase continues. One of the guys in the convertible pumps a shotgun. The leading police car spins, the second hits it, and the third swerves to avoid it. It catapults into the air and drops towards a group of bystanders, stopping suspended above them. The squad car is caught in a web. Spider-Man swings past, slips between the cab and trailer of a truck, and pursues the convertible. He soars, dives, and weaves to avoid bullets, fires two web pulls, and lands on the car's boot. He ensnares the men's weapons in their hands and tosses them over an overhead light, the men still attached.\n\nOn stage, MJ stares at Peter's empty seat. Peter screeches up to the theater in the convertible, enters the theater, and bends down to tie his shoelace watched by the usher. His tie is crooked. The usher points to his tie. Peter straightens his necktie, steps forward, and produces the ticket. The usher folds his arms. Peter walks to the door, turns back, and the usher gestures, locking his mouth. Peter looks at his ticket, glares at him, and sits on a stoop opposite the theater. A nearby street musician plays. Peter watches her, closes his eyes, shakes his head incredulously, and steps forward. MJ comes out through the stage door, followed by a girl. Peter smiles contentedly, but his smile fades as he sees the guy kissing MJ. He watches a police car fly past, followed by a few more. His attention returns to MJ, then he looks down sadly and moves off. MJ and her man walk off, arm-in-arm. MJ looks around briefly as if expecting to see Peter, but there's nobody there.\n\nPeter enters a steam-filled backstreet, breaks into a run, and tears open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man costume. He pulls on the red mask, leaps into the air, casting a web line to pull himself up. Later, a group of squad cars weave their way down a wide city street. Above them, Spider-Man swings from building to building. Hanging mid-swing, he flicks his wrists, falls 10 stories, landing on some metal. He hauls himself up from the now dented pipe, takes off his Spider-Man mask, and examines his wrist.",
    "685": "He leaps over the edge of the building and peers down at the street below. He tries to fire a web, but again nothing happens. He looks down at the street way below and waddles slightly. He pouts and frowns. Later, a man with a dog is waiting for an elevator. The doors open and the man is about to enter when he pauses, seeing a fully suited Spider-Man standing casually inside. Looking Spidey up and down, the man steps into the elevator and presses a floor button. Spider-Man looks down a little self-consciously. The man nods understandingly. The man puts his card back in his pocket. Spider-Man looks away from the man, then bows his head and stares at the wall. The man looks up at the floor display as it changes from 10 to nine. Spider-Man leans forward and presses a button. Later, Peter traipses down a deserted sidewalk. He passes a wall which has been plastered with MJ's perfume ads, showing her soft, pretty face. He looks at the images briefly, then carries on going, a preoccupied look on his face. He's dragging his broken moped along behind him. Peter sits doodling in Doctor Connors' class. He's drawn his face, half Peter Parker and half Spider-Man. On a pay phone outside, MJ comes home. MJ looks peeved. MJ gazes hopefully at the phone. She turns away. Peter slaps the phone, then shakes his head incredulously. Talking into the receiver, he looks up and shakes his head. He hangs up. Guests have gathered in Doctor Octavius' lab. Peter and Harry are amongst them. Octavius pulls off a dust sheet to reveal a device with four long mechanical limbs. He peels off his gray lab coat. He steps onto a platform, then taps keys on a freestanding control panel. The metal harness snaps into position around his waist. A mechanical spine curls up onto his back. A blue computer chip at the top of the synthetic spine glows, then a series of pins slide into his skin. He grimaces. His audience gasps. Octavius concentrates hard and stares up at the ceiling. The four metal limbs begin to move, rising up like snakes. On the end of each arm is a pointed pincer which opens out. Octavius reaches out his own arms. The four mechanical limbs hover above his head. Peter's eyes are wide. Equipment units are wheeled aside. The lights go out. Across the room stands a machine with a base from which four curved pillars rise. Octavius controls one of the mechanical arms. The pincer retracts. A much smaller pincer opens. A tube rises from a panel. The small pincer plucks a tiny sphere from inside it. The small pincer releases the sphere, which floats in the air between the four pillars of the machine.",
    "686": "The sphere begins to spin as Rosie approaches Octavius and smiles. He smiles back, takes a pair of dark goggles from her, and puts them on. He then taps keys on a control panel, prompting laser projectors to fire slender yellowish beams through the sphere from the top and bottom of each curved pillar. The beams cause the sphere to glow and spin faster before it suddenly expands into a fiery ball resembling the Sun. An old scientist speaks to Harry as mechanical arms grasp onto an energy field surrounding the glowing sphere. Peter looks down and sees a paper clip lift off the floor and shoot towards the fusion machine. Air ducts and hanging lights swing towards the machine, and Peter stares up, bathed in an orange glow. Looking a little flustered, Octavius taps on a control panel as necklaces and other personal objects get sucked into the sphere. He peers around at his anxious-looking wife. Peter moves away, and Harry looks around as metal panels are sucked off the walls. An arc of white-hot energy blasts out of the sphere, cutting into the ceiling, and an equipment unit rolls towards Harry. Spider-Man swings him to safety, then leaps onto the ceiling. Octavius looks up and swings a mechanical arm at Spider-Man, knocking him against the wall. A small energy arc leaps out from the sun's sphere, and the windows implode, sending shards of glass flying towards Octavius' wife. Her face is reflected in one of the shards as it heads straight for her eye. Octavius sees her slump to the floor. An arc of energy surges from the sphere and short-circuits the inhibitor chip. Spider-Man leaps over to the far cables and tugs on them, causing sparks to fly out. Octavius' body stops shaking, and he drops to the floor along with the mechanical arms. The power cables come away, and Spider-Man backflips onto the floor. The sphere implodes, then bursts into a cloud of fiery particles before imploding again. Darkness fills the land, and emergency vehicles arrive at the scene. Two singed scientists leave the building, and Harry trudges onto the street, wearing an angry expression. An Oscorp exec is present as Rosie's dead body, covered on a stretcher trolley, is wheeled over to an ambulance. With not a scratch on him, Peter wanders out of the building. At a hospital, medics are about to operate on an unconscious Octavius. The doctor points to graphics on a screen as Octavius' mechanical limbs are suspended from the ceiling. The doctor starts up a circular saw but stops, hearing a sound, and looks up. A pulley hanging from the ceiling swings. Edgy, the doctor prepares to cut one of the limbs but sees something reflected in another medic's goggles as he lowers the blade.",
    "687": "He spins around. One of the limbs knocks him through a glass door. The other three break free and start moving. One grabs a woman by the leg. A male medic is thrown across the operating room. Another limb smashes through a table and clamps onto a man's face, then tosses him across the room. A man is smashed into a lamp and electrocuted. The nurse is dragged along the floor by the leg. Octavius lies face down on the operating table, a bandage over his eyes. The nurse's fingernails cut grooves in the floor. A man is grabbed by the throat, then slammed against the table. He spots a chainsaw. Another medic is rammed into a wall. The doctor by the chainsaw reaches for it, but is pushed to the floor. The chainsaw pulls down weakly. He tries in vain to cut into the limb that's pinning him to the wall. The other three limbs sense danger and move towards him, viewing him with inbuilt cameras. The mechanical limbs move in for the kill. The chainsaw drops to the floor on the end of the man's limbed arm. Octavius lifts his head. Using its small pincer, one of the mechanical limbs gently pulls the bandage from his eyes. Octavius opens his eyes and looks about him wearily. His brow, alarm spreads over his face, and he kneels up on the operating table, the limbs rising with him. He tips back his head. Later, doors fly off the hinges. A yellow cab speeds towards him, then skids to a halt. Octavius cringes, then seems surprised when mechanical limbs lift the cab up and through to the air, it lands on another yellow taxi. Viewed through the fractured windscreen of the cab, two of the limbs move up to Octavius' face. Now, they detect a siren. Octavius slips away. Later, with the long mechanical limbs acting as legs, Octavius is carried onto a bridge tower. The pincers spot a ramshackle pier and a derelict warehouse way below. Octavius peers down at it. A sunny day in his office, Jameson addresses bulky Robbie. Jameson's surprised. He shoos Peter away. Octavius is in the warehouse on the dilapidated pier. He stares down through gaping holes in the floor. The mechanical limbs move slowly about him, like mythical serpents. He looks at the reptilian limbs in desperation. He stares forlornly into the water. Two of the limbs open their pincers aggressively. All four mechanical limbs hover, their pincers open. His face strained, his eyes widen and he reaches behind his head. He spins back around. The pincers near his face and move, as if talking. Octavius closes his eyes. Troubled, he stares hard at the floor.",
    "694": "Harry turns back to the stove and pours his egg. Mary Jane sprinkles on the cheese. Harry adds some rocket. He flicks the omelette in half. He tries to toss it in the pan. Half of it falls to the floor. Later, they read the script. Mary Jane brushes Harry's dark hair back from his brow then lets her gaze meet his adoring eyes. She pulls him towards her. They kiss. Mary Jane breaks off with a guilty look. Harry watches helplessly as she hurries down the black and white marble floored hallway into the lift. He storms into the study, grabs at the canter, and takes his wig. His father's portrait glowers down at him. Harry gates. He turns towards a tall mirror. Harry stares at his reflection and moves slowly towards it, hand outstretched. As his fingers touched the glass, in flashback, he sees Spider-Man standing over Norman's body and remembers pulling the Spider-Man mask off Peter's face. Harry remembers falling and waking up in the hospital. Harry's father looks back at him from the mirror. At night, Mary Jane comes home and hits the light switch. The lights don't come on. Harry in his goblin suit grabs Mary Jane by the throat. Hovering on his sky stick, he holds her up against the wall. Ursula, the landlord's daughter, smiles awkwardly. Peter nervously takes up the receiver. A couple strolled by the boating lake in Central Park. Peter, wearing a blue jumper over a blue shirt and jeans and clutching a small posy of flowers, stops in his tracks as he spots Mary Jane standing alone in the middle of a graceful cast iron bridge. He hurries on to meet her. He offers up the flowers. She looks at them unhappily. She turns aside, putting her hand over her eyes. Peter fumbles in his pocket for Aunt May's ring. Peter, looking as if he's been hit in the stomach, watches in numb shock as she hurries away off the bridge. A little way further along the lake, Harry is leaning against a tree observing the scene. He turns with a cruel smile as Mary Jane comes past, arms folded, and glares at him. Mary Jane turns away angrily and carries on. Harry lets his head drop against the tree trunk with a smile of satisfaction. Later, he meets Peter in a coffee shop. Harry draws breath. Peter looks Harry in the eye. Peter shakes his head and looks away in a daze. Blinking in shock and disbelief, Peter gets up and leaves. A waitress comes over to Harry with a coffee jar. Harry grins. Peter, crossing the road, turns and looks back.",
    "695": "Harry smiles and winks. A truck briefly blocks Peter's view. When it passes, Harry has disappeared from the coffee shop. Peter turns and looks around the street, eyes wide, mouth half open. Later, he sits on the bed in his room, hands clasped between his knees, staring ahead, his expression cold and malevolent. Slowly, his eyes swivel to the corner of the room. He turns his head and homes in on the black trunk on the floor of the closet. Lightning flashes in a dark sky. In his father's study, Harry pours himself a martini and adds a couple of olives. Sensing Peter behind him, he smiles without looking around. Harry sips his drink. Peter, wearing the black suit under his normal clothes, punches Harry. Peter's eyes widened. Harry stabs him in the thigh with a dagger. As they fight, a row of curved blades shoot out in Harry's forearm. Peter hauls him into a pummeled wall. Harry swings at it. Harry smashes his arm at Peter's head. The blades get stuck in the pillar behind. Peter slams his fist down on Harry's arm, breaking off the blades. Harry kicks him across the table. They circle each other. Peter kicks Harry through a glass partition. Harry wipes blood from his mouth. He dives at Peter who hauls him against another window. Peter throws Harry across the room. Harry picks himself up. They run at each other and crash through into the secret goblin lair. As Peter chases him through the lair, Harry picks up the goblin sword and swings it at him. Peter dodges the blade. Harry accidentally cuts through the table, tethering the sky stick, sending it spinning out of control. Peter pushes Harry's head up into the path of the sky stick. Harry's thrown against the wall of glass shelves and crashes to the ground. Peter flaws Harry with a final blow and walks away. Harry finds a pumpkin bomb to hand and hauls it after him. Peter lassos the bomb with a web and hauls it back, explode in Harry's face. Peter strolls along a street, fastening his shirt collar over the Black Spider-Man suit. Several women passing by give him the eye. At a newsstand, the Daily Bugle photo shows Black Spider-Man robbing a bank. In the Bugle office, Brock's celebrating. Brock hangs up a framed glow up of the front page. Peter comes up behind him. Peter drops a photo on the desk. Peter slams Brock against the wall. Brock looks around, smiling nervously. Peter hands Robby, the sub-editor, the original print from which Brock has faked the bank robbery shot. In Jameson's office, Jameson slaps the photo down. Floppy-head Peter is in his hallway with Ursula.",
    "698": "He looks up the vertiginous tower as if he were at the deep of a deep well. Peter tears up the tattered skin tight black fabric across his chest. Above him, Peter tears the unraveling Symbiote from his body. A slither of Symbiote falls onto Brock's shoulder. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the edge of the ledge that Peter's on and snakes down the bell tower. A globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on his shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy consuming the walls of a building. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that pushed him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock's face. Like a wild cat with ferocious jagged teeth, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with the water streaming over his tightly closed eyes. Slowly, his hooded dark eyes open with a dead vacant expression. A short time later, he's sitting on his floor for lonely leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the door and holds the door, which comes off in his hand. He prizes the door open with his fingertips. Aunt May looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf. He holds out the engagement ring and drops it into the palm of her hand. He turns away from his aunt's inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows. His mournful face is lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside. Aunt May puts the ring on the table and Peter half turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin tight black Spider Man style suit Venom swinging through the city on pretz. He is grabbed by Flint in an alleyway. Venom Berziz finds Flint, tosses him to one side. At night Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater across the street from Mary Jane's apartment building. In a lit top floor window he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane as she moves about her apartment. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly moisten and fill with tears. He bows his head and socks away. As Peter trudges off down the street Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a cab. Armored vehicles are tossed to side like toys by bursts of sand. Peter's in a crowd outside an electrical store watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock.",
    "703": "Harry falls to the floor of the building Mary Jane is on. Mary Jane runs to him. Meanwhile, Peter desperately tugs at the black threads holding his wrists. He frees one hand and grabs a sharp spear of metal as Venom leaps at him. Cutting himself free, he knocks Venom away. Peter grabs two of the pipes and spears them into the floor, then grabs two more and does the same, building a circular fence around Venom. The monster reels and half-disintegrates from the noise. Brock's face appears from within the symbiotic suit. Peter shoots a thread, pulls him free, and holds him through the bars. Behind Peter, the black spiky Venom suit assumes a life of its own, growing and flailing about. Peter and Brock look on in amazement as it tries to break out of its cage. Peter strikes the bells to make them ring, then grabs a pumpkin bomb. Brock leaps in after the bomb. Peter puts a hand to his face to shield it from the blast. When the spot clears, there's nothing left of Brock or the Symbiote. Behind him, Flint materializes, sand pouring from his arm. Meanwhile, Mary Jane runs down to where Harry lies on his back. She nods. Up above, Peter drops the tube he was carrying, his expression numb. Peter turns to find Flint right behind him. Peter's eyes narrow fractionally. As Peter listens, Flint's eyes become distant as he thinks back. In a black and white flashback, Uncle Ben sits in his car. Flint comes up with a gun and taps on the window. Uncle Ben squeezes Flint's shoulder. The accomplice runs up to Flint from behind and knocks him on the shoulder as he makes for the car. The gun discharges. Uncle Ben's eyes close, and he falls to the ground. Flint looks on, eyes wide with horror. He kneels over the dying man as his partner drives away. Flint lowers his eyes for a moment then looks back up at Peter. Peter frowns as he struggles to understand, then lowers his grief-stricken eyes and nods to himself. He looks back at Flint who meets his steadfast gaze. Flint goes over to the edge of the skyscraper and looks down at the emergency vehicles far below. A pale, dawn light is spreading across the sky above them. He looks at the silver locket he holds in his hand, with its tiny photograph of his daughter, and turns back to Peter. His eyes brimming, Flint looks sorrowfully but steadily at Peter, who nods with a look of understanding. The ghost of a smile flickers across Peter's face. Flint nods faintly and starts to disintegrate into a whirling eddy of sand.",
    "706": "He tries to run off but one of the capacitors hits him, throwing him back onto the sand. The air is thick with sand as he gets to his feet, trying to shield his face. Tiny granules of high velocity sand fly into his pores and shatter into fragments, fusing with his own molecules, giving his internal structure a sand-like appearance. Flint's hand becomes sand and his fingers blow away in a fierce wind. His entire body turns to sand and is eaten away by the wind until he completely disintegrates. The cops arrive at the edge of the pit and look down to find the capacitors slowing down and Flint nowhere to be seen. Peter sits alone in a hospital corridor, staring blankly at the paper cup in his hand. He looks up and hurriedly stands as a doctor approaches. The dark haired, bearded doctor goes, leaving Peter looking pensive. With a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. He turns to face the doorway and smiles as Peter steps inside. Mary Jane comes in. Mary Jane and Peter step into the corridor. Peter looks relieved. In the room, the nurse smiles at Harry. Large rocks roll and clink against each other. Seen from further away, the rocks look more like gravel, and from even further away the gravel reveals itself as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a beach. The sand forms a curving shape, almost like a human body. The undulating shape rises up as though to stand, then slumps down again. The shape reforms and slowly rises in the form of a human torso from the waist up. It's Flint, now transformed into Sandman. Sandman raises his arms and examines his bulky, paw-like hands. He looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head. Sandman looks at the mound of sand next to him and spots the locket Penny gave him lying nearby. He reaches out to pick up the locket but the loose sand of his hand just crumbles around it. He reaches out again and his hand becomes more human, with slim, mobile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, revealing Penny's picture inside. Sandman's hollow eyes look melancholy as they gaze down at the picture. He clenches the locket in his fist and hauls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a swamp. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he looks exactly as he did before the change, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, and beige chinos.",
    "707": "Peter smiles and looks at the ring, then slips it into the pocket of his jeans and opens the door to Mary Jane. She holds up a newspaper. He gives her a warm, guarded smile. She sits down. Peter smiles feebly. She nods sadly and looks down dejectedly. Peter, in his Spider-Man suit, gives her a little smile before putting on his head mask and leaping out of the window. Mary Jane stands up, gathers her bag, scarf, and newspaper, and goes for the door. Across the room, the black spider-like tendril crawls across a cabinet behind her, but freezes when she looks around. She leaves the apartment and the slimy, black mass drops to the floor. On a city street, two cops look up to the sky. A huge, towering jib crane swings around as its driver struggles with the controls. Gwen is part of a photo shoot in an office. The photographer checks his shot. Gwen and the other two models turn to the window as an enormous steel girder hanging from a chain swings towards them. They throw themselves to the floor as the girder smashes through the window. It rips out the supports along one corner of the building. A desk and other debris plummet to the ground. Captain Stacy arrives on the scene. In the devastated office, Gwen helps another mortal up. The huge yellow jib of the crane swings back towards the office and smashes out the supports beneath it. The office floor gives way in the desks. Another furniture tips out through the smashed windows. Gwen slides down the tilting floor and just manages to hang onto a telephone cable. The cable snaps but she clings onto the very edge of the floor. A blonde-headed young guy runs up behind Captain Stacy and starts taking photos. Stacy grabs the guy's camera and looks up at his daughter through the telephoto lens. Gwen's eyes widen in horror as the desk slides towards her. She releases her grip on the floor but manages to grab onto a long metal rail just below. As Spider-Man approaches swinging from building to building, the metal rail falls loose from the wall and buckles, swinging Gwen out above the streets hundreds of feet below. As Spider-Man swings and leaps towards the skyscraper, the crane's jib rips out through the building, sending huge chunks of metal towards him. Dodging the debris, Spider-Man just manages to catch Gwen, saving her from being crushed by two clashing slabs of concrete. Spider-Man swings down to the pavement with Gwen in his arms. Gwen hugs her dad. As Spider-Man swings away, Gwen gazes after him. In his office at the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson is in a meeting with a marketing guy.",
    "708": "The marketing guy slaps various slogans onto a whiteboard then smiles cockily at the grouchy newspaper editor. Jameson calms down and speaks into an intercom. He looks through the window at his assistant and points to one of a dozen pill bottles. She nods. He opens it. He forces a calm face and presses the intercom. He smiles graciously at the marketing guy. Brock slips into Jameson's office. Puffing on a cigar, Jameson waves Betty away dismissively. In Times Square, a billboard displays the letters NY followed by a heart and a picture of Spider-Man. A silver-haired man comes up alongside him. Peter ponders. With a friendly smile, the man goes. Later, Harry's doddery old man servant, Bernard, embraces his young master. Peter hands Harry an old basketball. Peter steals the ball from Harry and bounces it back to him in the lavishly-furnished hallway. Grabbing the ball from Harry, Peter turns into Norman's study and stares at the chaise longue and remembers laying Norman's dead body on it. Harry looks at his father's portrait. Peter tosses the ball to Harry and knocks a vase over. Harry nimbly catches the vase in one hand and the ball in the other. Peter looks concerned. Mary Jane strides into the theater where she's working. She comes through to the auditorium and her step falters. Another actress is going through her moves on stage. The actress spots Mary Jane at the back of the auditorium. Sitting in a sea of empty seats, the producer and director followed the actress's awkward gaze. The director puts on a fake smile. The producer looks unconvinced by his own suggestion. Mary Jane's blue eyes well up and she turns and walks away. The artistic duo return to their seats. Outside the theater, a crowd has gathered. Mary Jane's glum expression melts away. She smiles as they applaud. Her smile quickly fades as she realizes the crowd is not for her. She looks up at Spider-Man swinging by with barely fail resentment. She hurries through the crowd as her name is covered up on the theater front with the name of Andrea Rubin. Peter is standing amidst the delirious crowd, smiling to himself, drinking in the adulation. A marching band cuts through the workers waving placards and balloons. Brock approaches Gwen in the throng. Peter snaps Mary Jane. She forces a cheery smile as he walks off. The smile drops as she watches him disappear into the crowd. Elsewhere, stoney-faced Flint is lumbering along the street. He tilts his head. Some grains of sand seep out of his ear. He brushes them off his shoulder as he passes through cops. The cops raced to the front and back of a large tarpaulin-covered lorry.",
    "710": "He hits wreckage and glides off it as if it were a ramp, then lands on top of the van, hitting Flint with a volley of wet balls. Flint punches Spider-Man off the roof, but Spider-Man clings on. Flint punches him into the truck. The van is heading for a collision and Spider-Man pulls the guards out. He fires a thread out of the back of the van, which flints and crashes into a parked truck. Flint watches from the edge of a building above as Spider-Man staggers out of the red van, looking around frantically. As Flint moves off, the rescued guards drop from a web spun across the street. Spider-Man wheezes up to the ledge of a building, pulls off his mask, and shakes sand from his hair. He pulls off his left boot and shakes out some more sand. Later in the evening, Peter dressed smartly in a sober suit, his dark hair swept across in a neat side parting, stops a few feet away from the entrance of the restaurant Constellation and pulls Aunt May's ring out of his breast pocket. Looking agitated, Mary Jane strides up alongside a newsstand, then storms off with a face like thunder. Inside the restaurant, Peter takes in the opulent splendor as diners and waiters flip past him. He walks across the reception area and is summoned by a maitre d' with a pencil and a stash who's behind a small counter. The maitre d' has brought a pen on a silver platter, his dark beady eyes looking firmly at Peter. He puts on specs to examine it. Peter hands him a note. The maitre d' clenches his fist, then leads Peter to a table and scurries away. Peter snaps out of his role play and sees Mary Jane coming towards him in a little black dress. He shows her to her seat and chivalrously pulls out her chair for her. He spots simpering blonde Gwen waving at him and waves back. The maitre d' summons the champagne, but Peter hurriedly shakes his head, so the maitre d' waves the waiters away. Gwen waves at Peter as she walks away, and he waves back. The maitre d' takes this as the signal, but the helpless waiters are called off again as Peter shakes his head. The maitre d' bringing the champagne glasses passes Mary Jane as she storms out. Peter stares after Mary Jane in shock as the maitre d' sets the glasses down on the table and the waiter brings a champagne bucket. As a violinist serenades him, Peter picks up Mary Jane's glass and fishes the ring out of it with a fork, then dries the ring with a napkin.",
    "713": "Jack points toward the settee and Rose steps to it, then stretches out. She drapes one arm along the back of the settee and lays her hand on the pillow behind her head. She places her right hand near her temple, then, smiling, lowers her head and licks her lips. Jack peers over the top of his sketchpad, then draws a line. Looking from the paper to Rose, he sketches and grins. He runs his charcoal across the paper creating faint arcs and jerks his head to toss his hair out of his eyes. He adds details as he fleshes out the sketch and smiles as he darkens a shadow under Rose's breasts. Rose gazes at Jack as he draws. With his finger, he rubs various parts of the charcoal drawing, Rose's hand, forehead, and face. Rose stares expressionless, then gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes, and she transforms into her older self. The crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, stare at her. Brock and Lizzie exchange smiles. Jack signs and dates the drawing, then blows on it. He closes his sketchbook and hands it to Rose, then they kiss. Later, Rose writes on a sheet of paper and Jack steps up to her. She hands him the case holding the Heart of the Ocean. Jack walks into the next room and slides the case into the safe. In the first class smoking room, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands. The Titanic moves slowly. On the bridge, the helmsman turns the ship's wheel as a ship's officer steps up to Captain Smith. Captain Smith looks down as he stirs a slice of lemon in his tea, then walks off. Stepping back into Rose's suite, Jack blows on his hands. Wearing an evening dress, Rose joins him. She grabs Jack and pulls him through the sitting room toward a door. Lovejoy steps into the suite and Rose and Jack hurry into Rose's bedroom. Rose closes the door and Lovejoy strides through the sitting room. Jack and Rose step through another door into a corridor. Lovejoy bursts into another room and Jack and Rose hurry down the corridor. Lovejoy opens a door and glimpses Jack and Rose, who walk faster. Lovejoy follows them and Jack and Rose run to an elevator. They dash into the elevator and the operator slides the grate shut. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator and slams his hands against the grate. As the elevator descends, Lovejoy glares through glass at them. Rose raises her middle finger, then waves. Lovejoy hurries to the staircase. The elevator opens, and Rose and Jack spill out. Lovejoy runs down a staircase as Jack and Rose scramble from the bottom of a different staircase. Jack bumps onto a food table.",
    "714": "He and Rose run through swinging doors into a white corridor, then stop. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator, then scans the area around himself. Lovejoy peers in a door's round window. Rose rushes down the corridor. They turn a corner and stop at a closed door. Jack opens a different door. They step inside as Lovejoy turns the corner and tries to open the door. Inside, Rose holds her hands to her ears. Jack peers down a ladder at rising smoke. In the boiler room, men shovel coal into the furnaces. Near them, Jack helps Rose down the ladder. Jack and Rose run through the smoky boiler room, past men shoveling coal. One man turns to watch them run past. Rose and Jack run through drifting smoke. A metal door opens. Jack and Rose step through it and into the cargo hold. They look around themselves as they walk past crates and stacks of boxes. Leading Rose by the hand, Jack hurries around a stack of crates, then stops at a gleaming black car. He lets go of Rose's hand, then peers inside the car. Jack steps around Rose to the passenger door. He holds out his hand and opens the door. Rose takes his hand and steps up into the passenger compartment. Jack shuts the door. As Rose glances around herself, Jack steps into the open-sided driver's seat. Rose pulls down a glass partition. Rose reaches over Jack's shoulders, then pulls him into the passenger compartment. Sitting on the seat, Jack puts his arm around Rose. They gaze into each other's eyes as they interlock their fingers. Rose lays her head on Jack's shoulder, then kisses his fingertips. She places Jack's hand on her breast. They kiss. The Titanic leaves a long wake in the dark ocean. In the metal crow's nest, attached to a mast. Murdoch, with his collar up, peers over the railing outside the wheelhouse. In the backseat of the car, Rose slaps her hand against the back window, then slowly slides it downward. Naked and his face dripping with sweat, Jack lies on top of Rose. He breathes heavily as they gaze at each other. They kiss. Rose strokes Jack's hair, then kisses his forehead. He lays his head on her chest. Two stewards with flashlights step down a short corridor and into the cargo hold. Cal opens the safe. He pulls out a note and Jack's portfolio. Lovejoy approaches. Cal opens the portfolio and studies the drawing of Rose. He reads the note. Cal's forehead tenses as he closes, then opens his eyes. He glances at the note again. In the hold, the two stewards creep toward the car. One steward shines his flashlight in the car's steamed-up windows.",
    "715": "He snaps his fingers and points to the car, then yanks open the car door, revealing empty seats. Smiling, Rose and Jack run onto the forward well deck. Rose places her hand on Jack's lips and gazes at him. They kiss. Standing at the bridge rail, Murdoch glances down at them, smiles, and walks off. Watching from the crow's nest, another man, Fleet, looks down and taps his comrade, Lee, on the arm. They stare down at Jack and Rose. The men turn and gaze past the ship. Their eyes widen as a large iceberg looms, straight ahead. Fleet rings the lookout bell three times and grabs a telephone, which rings on the bridge. The quartermaster at the wheel glances back at the phone. Officer Moody steps onto the bridge and answers the phone. Moody hangs up and turns to Murdoch as he runs to the bridge door. Quartermaster Hichens turns the wheel to the left. Murdoch rushes over to the engine room telegraph and shifts the handle to full speed astern. Hichens turns the wheel quickly. In the engine room, the chief engineer spots the telegraph shift and drops a pot of steaming soup. Turns the wheel until it stops. Murdoch hurries to the bridge rail and peers at the iceberg. In the engine room, an engineer yells. Other engineers scurry around. A red warning light flashes. Engineers slam the furnace dampers shut. Underwater, the ship's main propeller slows. An engineer pulls down a thick lever. All the propellers stop. An Officer pushes an engineer out of the way and turns a wheel quickly to the right. The propellers spin in the opposite direction. In the crow's nest, the men stare at the iceberg as the ship heads straight toward it. Murdoch stares at the iceberg. Nearing the iceberg, the ship veers slowly to the left. The ship's propellers turn and reverse. Sweat trickles down Murdoch's temples. The ship's bow shifts to the left of the iceberg. At the bow railing, a man runs toward it. The ship scrapes along the side of the ice. Jack and Rose stop kissing as the ship trembles. On the bridge deck, Murdoch glances down at his hands, resting on the shaking rail. Above, Fleet holds onto the rim of the crow's nest, while Lee sits on the floor. In the bridge, Hichens keeps the wheel turned hard left. Below deck, Fabrizio sits up in his bunk. In the cargo hold, water shoots through a long tear in the hull. In the cabin, Andrews sits at his desk. He glances up at the trembling crystal chandelier above. In the crow's nest, Fleet and Lee gaze at the iceberg. On the bridge, Hichens turns the wheel to the right.",
    "717": "The steward removes Jack's coat, while the master-at-arms frisks him. The steward pulls the necklace from the pocket. Cal takes the necklace. Cal walks past Rose. The master-at-arms handcuffs Jack. Lovejoy passes the coat to the master-at-arms. The master-at-arms carts Jack away. In the chartroom, Andrews unrolls the ship's blueprint. Andrews, Smith, and others study the blueprint. Andrews stares at the blueprint, then turns to Smith. Smith glances away with his brow furrowed. Murdoch swallows hard. A ship officer enters and stands in a doorway. Smith turns toward Ismay. Alone in the sitting room, Cal walks toward Rose. She blinks, then gazes at him. Cal stares at her and opens his mouth, as if to speak, then slaps her face. He grabs her. The steward enters. Cal releases Rose. The steward fetches two life belts. Stewards open the cabin doors in third class. Smith writes coordinates. He hands the message to dark-haired Jack Phillips. Smith takes off his hat and glances at the door. Slack-jawed, Phillips stares at Smith. Smith puts his hat back on and walks out. Phillips and Bride, a young brown-haired man, exchange glances. Phillips puts on a headset and sends a telegraph. On the boat deck, officers supervise and swing them out over the water. Chief Officer Wilde stands at lifeboat four. Wilde yells to a man on an upper deck. Andrews enters the A deck foyer, where dozens of passengers chat and drink as musicians play. A waiter approaches Andrews with drinks on a tray. Nearby, Molly Brown stops a brown-haired steward. Molly passes Cal, Rose, and Ruth. Ruth turns to her two maids. The maids leave. Rose stops Andrews as he wanders past. Andrews pulls Rose aside. Cal stands nearby. Cal leans forward. Andrews nods and walks off. Meanwhile, in his office, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a vertical water pipe. Lovejoy stands nearby. A dark-haired crewman rushes in. Lovejoy pulls out a handgun. As he leaves with the crewman, the master-at-arms hands Lovejoy the handcuff key. Jack and Lovejoy stare at each other as Lovejoy sits in a desk chair. On the bridge, Bride runs up to Smith. Lightoller, a man with short, light brown hair, and Murdoch hurry over to Smith. Lightoller glances at Murdoch and rushes to passengers. Band-leader Wallace Hartley leads the band onto the boat deck. The band plays. In steerage, a steward hands out life belts to third-class passengers. Fabrizio follows Tommy, who grabs a life belt and puts it on. They stand behind a crowd of passengers on the stairs leading to the main deck. At the top of the stairs, a steward stands behind a locked gate. A young brown-haired boy turns to his auburn-haired mother.",
    "718": "The mother glances at her young daughter, who nods. The two stewards exchange glances. Murdoch directs sailors lowering lifeboats filled with women and children. As one of the lifeboats tilts to one side, the passengers on board grimace. The sailors level the boat and lower it toward the water. A crewman fires a flare into the night sky. The passengers on deck, including Rose and Cal, gaze up. A young blond girl watches the flares and smiles. The flare explodes into separate fiery streams that fall. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack looks out through a porthole at the water, which almost reaches the middle of the glass. Sitting near Jack, Lovejoy places a bullet on a table, shoves the clip into the handgun, stands, punches Jack in the stomach, causing Jack to wince. Lovejoy picks up the handcuff key from the table, places it in his breast pocket, and leaves. Molly Brown helps a brunette woman. Cal smiles at Lightoller. Rose watches a tearful woman hug her husband. Ruth scans the passengers on the lifeboat, turns to Rose and smiles. Rose glares at Cal. Molly stands in the lifeboat, helps Ruth into the boat. Rose's jaw slackens as she stares at Cal. Cal places Rose's life belt in the boat. Ruth and Molly reach toward Rose. Cal gestures. Rose walks away. Cal follows and grabs her. As she steps away, Cal grabs Rose and spins her toward him. Rose spits in Cal's face and runs off. The crewmen lower the lifeboat. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack peers at the water covering the porthole window, bangs his handcuffs against the water pipe. Water floods a staircase and streams down a long corridor leading to the office. In the first-class corridor, Rose searches for Andrews. In another corridor, Andrews stops a steward and turns to a brunette woman, a blond maid, checks a passenger cabin. Rose runs to him. Andrews shakes his head. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack drops his head, water streams in under the door, climbs up the water pipe near the ceiling and bangs the handcuffs against the pipe. Elsewhere, Rose bumps into a steward as she runs to an elevator. As she reaches the elevator, an elevator operator with dark blond hair stops her. Rose shoves the operator into the elevator. The operator pushes a lever down as Rose closes the door. In the office, Jack tries to pull off the handcuffs. In the elevator, Rose's chest heaves. The elevator descends into rising water, which pours into the elevator. Rose opens the elevator doors and steps into a flood corridor. The operator pulls the lever up. Water empties out of the elevator as it rises.",
    "720": "Rose swings the ax and hits the cabinet door, missing the first mark by several inches. She approaches Jack, grips the axe handle with both hands, and moves her hands apart. Jack stretches the chain across the pipe and closes his eyes. Rose closes her eyes, swings, and cuts the handcuff chain in half. Jack lifts his hands and smiles. They move into the corridor. Rose points to the flooded stairway. Jack pulls her toward the opposite end of the corridor. Outside, passengers paddle two lifeboats away from the Titanic. In one lifeboat, Molly and Ruth stare at the ship, now tilted forward with its bow nearly submerged. A flare shoots up from the bridge deck and explodes. On the boat deck, passengers crowd around the remaining lifeboats. As Lightoller seats people in the lifeboat, one woman toting luggage tries to climb aboard. Lightoller pulls a sobbing gray-haired woman away from her husband and puts her in the boat. An auburn-haired woman cries and kisses a brown-haired man. Cal turns toward Lovejoy as he approaches. Rose follows Jack, who uses the axe to break through the door and into the corridor. A steward addresses them and follows Jack and Rose. Jack and Rose glance back. The steward stops in his tracks. Lightoller picks up a woman and places her in a boat. Andrews rushes over. Lightoller gazes out at several partially filled lifeboats moving away from the Titanic and motions to waiting passengers. Several full lifeboats are lowered to the water. Fabrizio and other passengers pop open the third-class gangway door and peer out along the ship. Two seamen pull the passengers back in and close the door. Tommy and others stand at the locked gate atop the third-class stairwell. Two stewards unlock the gate. A woman and several men rush through the open gate. The stewards push back the men, punch them, and hit them with axe handles. One steward pulls out a small handgun and points it at the crowd now contained behind the closed gate. Jack and Rose reach the bottom of the third-class stairs. Atop the stairs, Tommy grips the gate and glares at the armed steward. Tommy glowers and points at the steward, then runs downstairs. Fabrizio rushes over. Jack hugs him. In the suite, Cal removes the heart of the ocean, along with some cash, from the safe and puts it in his jacket pocket. He glances at Lovejoy. Lovejoy opens his jacket, revealing a handgun in a shoulder holster. Cal closes the safe, locks it, and walks out. Elsewhere, Jack and the others run along a crowded corridor. Jack leads them down another corridor. They pass a mustached man flipping through a book and studying a sign on the wall.",
    "721": "Jack leads Rose and his friends down another corridor and up a stairway to another locked gate. At the top, a steward addresses a small crowd from behind a locked gate. Jack grabs the gate and shakes it, then rushes over and pulls on a wooden bench nailed to the floor. Fabrizio and Tommy help Jack pull up the bench. They charge forward and ram the gate, then ram it again. Jack, Rose, and other passengers pass the steward, and Tommy punches the steward. On the boat deck, passengers swarm around the remaining lifeboats. Lightoller pushes away a group of men. A man knocks a woman off the deck, but a sailor pulls her back on. The man grabs onto the side of the lifeboat and dangles high above. Lightoller lifts a revolver and waves it at the group of men, then turns toward a young sailor. Lightoller loads his revolver, while Lowe boards the lifeboat. On the other side of the ship, Cal and Lovejoy peer down as Murdoch supervises the lowering of a lifeboat. They see one lifeboat being lowered onto another lifeboat sitting in the water but unable to detach. In the lower lifeboat, a man labors to cut the ropes connecting the two boats. On the other side of the ship, Lowe stands in a lifeboat as it is lowered. He waves his revolver at men on the decks as they try to jump into the boat. Cal and Lovejoy turn as Lowe fires his gun in the air. Cal follows Murdoch toward the bow. Meanwhile, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy arrive on the upper deck and run to the side of the ship. Jack stands up on the railing and gazes toward the bow. As he steps down, Rose stops the mustached Colonel Gracie. Jack, Rose, and the others run toward the bow. Meanwhile, as the band plays on deck, a passenger bumps into one of the violinists. Hartley's brow furrows, but as the band resumes playing, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy run past. Elsewhere, Murdoch and several seamen load a small boat. Murdoch glances around, then turns to a sailor. Cal slips money into Murdoch's pocket. Murdoch glances down at the cash, then exchanges looks with Cal and walks off. On the port side, Lightoller loads passengers into a boat and shoots into the sky. In the crowd, Jack turns to Tommy, and Tommy moves off through the crowd. Meanwhile, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands beside the small boat, called a collapsible. Cal glances away. Murdoch turns to Cal and Lovejoy, while Ismay helps load the collapsible. Cal stares at the collapsible, then blinks. Cal turns and walks off.",
    "726": "A viola player glances back, then returns and joins him. The bass player carries his bass back, then stands on the other side of Hartley. The cello player also returns. Captain Smith stares across the wheelhouse, gazes through a window at the rising water, then places one hand on the helm. Water pours in beneath the door. In the smoking room, Andrews checks his pocket watch as the glass slides off the mantel. He opens the clock on the mantel and adjusts the time, then shuts the clock and leans against the mantel, gazing downward. An elderly couple lies in bed as water streams beneath them, and the man kisses the woman. A red-haired woman leans over two young children sleeping in a bed. Elsewhere, a Degas painting of a woman wearing a long tutu floats beneath water. On deck, people run past the band and scramble about. Fabrizio unties the lifebelt on Tommy's body. People rush away from the rising water. The girl in Cal's arms looks around herself, wide-eyed. People work to right the overturned lifeboat, and one sailor slides down a rope. Fabrizio puts on the lifebelt as water surges around him. Water rushes over the listing ship, causing some people to fall into the water. Fabrizio opens the knife and Cal backs away from the rushing water. Fabrizio and others try to cut the ropes. Inside, people slip and fall near the Grand Staircase. Guggenheim, wearing a top hat and formal wear, sits in a chair, watching with wide eyes. Outside, people fall into the water, others run up the deck from the approaching water. In the wheelhouse, Smith stares wide-eyed as water covers the glass windows. Outside, on one of the decks, passengers wade through waist-deep water toward the lifeboat in the middle of the ship. Fabrizio slices through the rope with his pocket knife, partially freeing the boat, but causing it to tip onto its side. Cal climbs onto the high side of the capsizing lifeboat. Railings will pull themselves onto pieces of floating debris. Several people run toward the backend of the Titanic, which is now tilted up at a slight angle. Some passengers hang from ropes or leap into the icy sea. Jack and Rose make their way to a railing near the rear of the ship and turn back. Jack grabs Rose's hand and runs through the crowd. They make their way to the crowd. Water swamps the base of the first funnel as it sinks below the ocean's surface. Inside the ship, sea water floods the grand staircase. Passengers and crew grab onto anything they can as the water rises. Jack climbs over a railing and helps Rose climb over.",
    "732": "Rose gulps as she stares at the comb. Brock kneels beside her. Rose nods. Later, a computer animation of the Titanic striking an iceberg. Lizzie stands behind her grandmother as Rose climbs out of her wheelchair. The crew watches Rose as she shuffles to a video monitor displaying footage of the Titanic wreck. Rose blinks and inhales sharply as the door with the ornate, leaded glass window comes into view. In a flashback, two men wearing tuxedos smile and nod as they open a pair of doors with leaded glass windows. On the video monitor, grayish growth covers the window's ornate scrollwork. Rose places her hands over her mouth. Rose turns away from the monitor and returns to her wheelchair. Brock switches on a tape recorder as he sits across from Rose. Brock grins, then nods. On a video monitor behind Rose, the corroded Titanic wreck transforms into a gleaming ocean liner moored alongside a dock. Passengers walk up one of three gangplanks. Men and women toting suitcases make their way to the Titanic. A crane loads an antique car onto the ship. Sitting in her father's arms, a young brunette girl watches a fleet of gleaming automobiles arrive. A chauffeur wearing a tweed uniform and black leather gloves steps out of the driver's seat and opens the car's back door. He takes a woman's gloved hand as she steps out of the car. The brown haired woman, who wears a white dress with thin black stripes and a large brimmed hat, gazes up at the enormous ship. A black haired man wearing a bowler hat and grey suit steps out behind her. The man hands over money. The man checks his pocket watch then steps to Rose and her mother. Rose follows her fiancee, Cal Hockley, through the crowd. A health inspector runs a comb through a man's dark hair and beard. Ruth strides ahead of Rose and Cal as they walk up a gangplank. Inside a saloon with a view of the Titanic men smoke and drink as they play a game of cards. A brown haired card player turns to a man beside him. Blonde Jack deals Sven another card and then exchanges one of his own for a card from the deck. Eyes narrowed, Jack smokes a cigarette as he peers across the table to Sven's partner. Several silver coins, a pocketknife, a pocket watch, and a pair of third class tickets for the Titanic rest in the middle of the table. A black haired man raps his knuckles on the table. Sven lays down his cards. Fabrizio snatches the tickets and dances. As Jack sweeps up the coins, Olaf grabs his collar. Jack closes his eyes as Olaf makes a fist but Olaf punches Sven instead.",
    "736": "Rose leans forward and spits. Rose's mother and her friends stroll nearby. As Ruth steps up, Rose taps Jack's arm. He turns around and swallows. Rose steps towards her mother then glances at Jack. Smiling at Jack, Molly points to her own chin. Jack quickly wipes saliva off his own chin. Jack waves as Rose and her mother walk off. Jack lifts his hands and shrugs. Elsewhere, Molly helps Jack into a black tuxedo jacket. Molly and Jack gaze into a full-length mirror. At dusk, the Titanic trails black smoke from its four smoke stacks, the funnels, as it sails toward the setting sun. Later, a steward opens a door for Jack. Wearing a white tie and shirt, Jack smiles at the steward as he steps inside. He pauses, then walks toward an ornate railing and columns beneath the dome skylight. Jack steps to the railing and gazes down at a couple descending the ship's grand staircase. Jack glances up at the skylight and walks down the staircase to the landing where he studies a wall clock with an elaborately carved wooden casing. Jack descends past a winged statue. Couples wearing forming evening wear stroll or stand about chatting. Jack leans against a column, then glances at a bearded man standing erect with his left arm behind his back. Jack stands up straight and places his own arm behind his back. Jack nods to the man as he and a woman stroll past. Jack watches the couple, then gazes up the staircase as Cal and Ruth descend toward him. Cal eyes Jack as they stepped past him. From the staircase's landing, Rose gazes down at Jack who pretends to shake somebody's hand, practicing to be a gentleman. He turns and looks up at Rose who wears a floor length black lace dress. She smiles and descends the stairs toward him. Rose stops a few steps above Jack who takes her white gloved hand and kisses it. Jack holds out his bent right arm for Rose who takes it. She smiles as he tilts back his chin, nose in the air. Arm-in-arm, they stroll up to Cal. Cal and Ruth step arm-in-arm toward the reception room. Rose smiles at Jack as they follow. Later Rose and Jack descend another wide, curving staircase. A dark haired woman speaking with a white-haired man. They gaze toward a group of people. Molly takes Jack's other arm. Rose, Jack, and Molly step into the large dining room. Mustached Astor returns. Jack and Rose stroll through the dining room. They stop at their table. Jack waves his hand. Rose gestures across the table at Jack to put his napkin in his lap. Jack gazes down at an array of silverware placed on both sides of the charter holding his plate.",
    "738": "A bearded man knocks into Jack and spills his beer on Rose. Bjorn slammed Thomas' fist to the tabletop. Rose pulls Tommy's cigarette from his mouth, puffs on it, blows out smoke, and hands Jack the hem of her skirt. As Jack holds onto her dress, Rose slowly lifts her heels and rises onto her toes. Jack gazes down as Rose stands on her tiptoes and collapses into Jack's arms. Cal's manservant, Lovejoy, descends halfway down the staircase and peers around the room. He spies Jack holding Rose in his arms. The couples hold hands as they dance in a line through the crowded room. Fabrizio grabs Rose's hand and she grabs Jack. The line of dancers snake through the clapping drinking crowd. The next day, Rose and Cal eat breakfast at a table in the private promenade. Cal shakes his head. As Rose stirs her coffee, she and Cal exchange glances. Cal stands and flips over their dining table. Cal walks away. As he steps through the doorway, an aproned woman rushes over to Rose, then bends and picks up dishes. Rose crouches to help. Rose lays her hand on dark haired Trudy's shoulder and sinks against her chair. Later in Rose's room, Trudy laces up the back of Rose's corset. Ruth steps in. Trudy curtsies and steps out. Ruth walks to Rose and ties the laces of her corset. Turning her head, Ruth covers her mouth. She closes her eyes, exhales, and drops her hand. Ruth turns back to Rose. Ruth gazes at Rose, then reaches out her hands. Gently cradling Rose's face, Ruth kisses her cheek. She turns Rose back around, then continues lacing the corset. Rose grimaces as Ruth tightens the laces. In the dining room, a man plays piano as first class passengers, holding sheet music, sing. Rose stands between Cal and her mother. Jack descends the grand staircase. One hand in his pocket, Jack strolls toward the dining room where two stewards stand outside its doors. One steward wearing a dark suit steps in front of Jack. Inside, Lovejoy steps toward the door. Lovejoy emerges. Lovejoy hands the money to the steward. The two stewards escort Jack away. On the bridge, a crewman steps up to the captain. Captain Smith reads a note, then smiles at Ruth. Outside, Jack climbs a railing, then hops onto a deck where a boy wearing a cap winds a string around a top. The boy spins the top on the deck. Jack steps toward another railing, pauses, and picks up a black bowler hat and long coat from a chair. Donning the hat, Jack wets his fingers and plasters down his hair. Wearing the hat and coat, Jack grabs Rose's arm.",
    "74": "We approach a riverside village and center on an open touring car driving along a river road. We stoop low towards the car. The driver is dressed in dark clothes, a paper collar, and a string tie. As he drives, pleasant river landscapes flow behind him. He talks to himself, nods, smiles, and touches his hat. A widow has a little wad of bills hidden away in the sugar bowl. The driver shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill. The stones of a country graveyard gleam in the last daylight. He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill. Meanwhile, a woman is hard at work, with music playing off-screen. Among the members of a sad burlesque audience, the driver is in strong contrast, bearing a sour and aggressive expression. We move in fast to a head close-up. A hand labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles grips and flexes. Before we see the lettering, he slides it into his pocket. His head slants, a cold smile appears, and one eyelid flutters. A hand descends firmly onto his shoulder. He glances up behind him. He bends down and speaks quietly next to a preacher's ear. A grim stone turreted facade with an American flag idles at top center. Elsewhere, John, who is nine, and Pearl, who is five, sit in the grass, a sentimental picture. They are working together on Pearl's doll; Pearl is dressing her, while John gets on a difficult shoe. He proudly exhibits the shod foot. They look off-screen, get up, Pearl dangling the doll. A Model-T Ford approaches at maximal speed on an uneven dirt road. The car careens towards us, then swings into the side yard as we pan, and stops. Ben Harper half-falls out of the far door, his shoulder blood-stained, his eyes wild. He is a hefty, simple man of thirty. He looks at them, dazed, across the car. He comes around clear of the car with a revolver in one hand and a bloody roll of banknotes in the other. He moves forward and out, and in his place, we see two police cars, small in the distance, coming fast. They move at high speed, with sirens. Ben and his children, tiny in the distance, dilate. Police cars approach in the background. Pearl hugs her doll. In the background, the troopers get out of their cars and fan out cautiously to surround Ben, guns in hand. Ben backs away from his children, raising his hands, gun in one hand. We pull back a little, enlarging the group shot and the role of the troopers in it. Two troopers approach Ben from behind. He runs forward and clasps his stomach, with his mouth open. One trooper smacks the back of Ben's head with a pistol barrel.",
    "740": "Celia brings a drink. Jolene runs up onto the stage. Minnie and Aibileen exchange a look. Mrs. Walters smiles gaily. Celia shimmies up behind Hilly. As Hilly tries to stop her, she rips her sleeve. Hilly's look of horror is followed by a patronizing smile. Celia suddenly looks pale. She weaves her way through the tables. Minnie slips away. Hilly is at the bottom of the stairs, saying goodnight to her guests. Hilly grimaces angrily as her mother parades her pie at shoulder height like a waitress. Mrs. Walters and a male guest walk off. Next morning, Celia shakes her head despairingly. Minnie moves towards her. Like a school teacher, she points Celia to a seat at the base of the bed and closes the door of the bedroom. Celia shoots Minnie an appalled sidelong glance. At her house, Aibileen and Minnie are smiling at Skeeter's manuscript. At her home, Skeeter drops her bag on the floor and walks into her mother's bedroom where Charlotte is sitting on her bed without a wig sewing a sampler. Charlotte takes off her specs and stares at her. In flashback, Charlotte poses with her medal. She winks at Constantine, who is nodding approvingly by the door. At the lunch following the medal ceremony, Constantine is serving each lady in turn, under Charlotte's rather anxious gaze. Charlotte glances towards the door and then at Constantine, who has not heard the knocking. Constantine sees her going to the door. Charlotte glances over her shoulder. Charlotte shuts the fly screen. Rachel's face falls. She barges in. The guest of honor looks appalled. Charlotte weighs up her options. Charlotte swallows hard. Rachel leads her mother away by the hand, both of them looking back at Charlotte in disbelief as they go through the door, onto the porch. Constantine turns and looks back at Charlotte through the fly screen. Charlotte's brown eyes meet her gaze for a second. Then she looks at the unforgiving faces of the Daughters of America seated at her dining table. The frail, old servant won't be moved, keeping her uncomprehending gaze directed at Charlotte. Charlotte shuts the door in her face. Constantine, in a smart, cream dress and navy hat, is packing her suitcase. She tosses a cross to the door of her bedroom. Her fingers trace the lines on the door where she had marked Skeeter and Rachel's heights as they grew. Finally arriving at the top. In the present, Skeeter sheds bitter tears. Skeeter shakes her head in numb disbelief. Charlotte, her own eyes welling, covers her mouth with her hand, seeing Skeeter's unhappiness. Skeeter drives the blue Cadillac slowly along a dirt road and peers through some trees at a single-story, white clapboard house, its roof overgrown, standing in a small clearing.",
    "742": "Skeeter looks away troubled. Her mother weighs her words carefully. Looking at her handsome, regal looking mother, Skeeter nods in acknowledgement, but then lowers her eyes. Smiling warmly, Charlotte leans in and kisses Skeeter on the forehead. Skeeter tries to smile, but is overcome by sadness. Charlotte hugs her tightly. Out in the sunshine, Minnie is strolling towards Celia's house with a bag of groceries, fanning herself in the heat. A red Chevrolet Corvette Convertible rolls into view. Minnie's eyes shift, but she doesn't quicken her pace. The car zooms right up behind her. She turns to see Johnny at the wheel. She hurries towards the house. She throws down the grocery bag and picks up a loose branch. She tosses away the branch. Johnny helps pick up the groceries. He hands her her bag. With a gentle guiding hand at her back and a good-natured smile, he walks her towards the house. In the heavily decorated dining room, Celia, in an off-the-shoulder dress, carefully places a dish of cookies into the center of the table, alongside a cooked ham, several cakes and pies, and other dishes of food. Johnny, taking off his jacket, leads the way into the dining room and stands next to his wife. Minnie looks bemused. Minnie's lips crease into a smile. Celia beams from ear-to-ear. Johnny pulls out a chair for Minnie. As Celia serves up, Minnie looks admiringly at the spread in front of her. Minnie and Aibileen, smartly dressed, hurry to church. The whole congregation stands. Looking bewildered, Aibileen joins in the clapping. Aibileen looks from smiling Pearly to smiling Minnie. He proffers her the book and she stares at it numbly. With her eyes lowered, she takes it from him. Finally, summoning up a smile, Minnie standing with the congregation lifts an approving eyebrow. Now, Aibileen beckons her to join her, and she, too, seems suddenly shy, stepping up next to her friend in front of all the people. The two women stand arm-in-arm facing the packed church. Outside her home, Skeeter leafs through the pages of signatures. Skeeter's expression is solemn. She hesitates to meet their gaze. Aibileen holds out her hand to Skeeter. Skeeter smiles and nods through her tears. Back on duty, Aibileen lets herself into Elizabeth's kitchen through the back door, her arms loaded with groceries. Hilly is with Elizabeth and her baby son. Mae Mobley runs up to Aibileen. Hilly blocks her. Elizabeth hurries out of the room with the baby. Hilly eyes Aibileen with ice-cold menace. Aibileen grabs Hilly's arm. Her lips trembling, Hilly holds Aibileen's firm gaze, then runs off into the next room. Aibileen blows out her cheeks as she tries to catch her breath.",
    "743": "Mrs. Walters watches TV as she has her lunch. Skeeter arrives and joins the young women, hugging Elizabeth and then Hilly. Hilly bites her lip. The bridge game is now in full swing, with Skeeter playing with Hilly, Elizabeth, and Jolene. Hilly kicks Jolene with her stilettoed foot and smiles blithely. Skeeter goes on and lowers her eyes awkwardly. In the kitchen, Aibileen answers the phone. As platinum blonde Celia, in a yellow playsuit, rings off, her husband creeps up behind her, nuzzles her neck, and bends her backwards by the edge of their swimming pool. Mrs. Walters has dropped off in front of the TV. As Aibileen goes to take her plate, she takes another mouthful. Skeeter smiles at Aibileen, who is replenishing the ladies' glasses. Elizabeth notices Hilly squirming. Aibileen listens passively and has heard every word. Skeeter watches Aibileen and looks down at her lap. Later, Hilly and her friends are standing by their cars. Skeeter is inside, watching them through a window. She wanders across to Aibileen, who is clearing up and looks across with the same passive expression as before. Skeeter's attention is drawn to the voice on the TV. Aibileen hands Skeeter a piece of paper. Elizabeth gives her a thin, cool, smile. Skeeter pulls up outside a columned portico two-story house. With her jacket over her arm and her briefcase in the other, she walks past a black servant trimming a box hedge at the front entrance. She hurries into the hall and up a wide, wooden staircase. Mother is sitting at her dressing table in an evening dress and an elfin brown wig. Her mother, Charlotte, with a cigarette in one hand, scoots off to the bathroom, pulling off the wig, next to several wigs on stands. Grimly, she eyes her own limp and thin hair in the mirror. Skeeter slumps down on a sofa, looking annoyed. Charlotte comes out in a brown bob and waits for Skeeter's approval. She steps out of the green dress. Skeeter scowls at her reflection. Her mother zips her up roughly and sits Skeeter down. At dinner, Charlotte pats Carlton's hand. Robert Phelan takes a sip of bourbon. Across the table, Charlotte looks awkward. Carlton, wearing a stiff smile, glances from one parent to the other. Skeeter fixes her eyes on her mother, who is concentrating on her soup. As Skeeter storms away from the table, Phelan frowns lamely. His tall, angular wife pats him on the shoulder and leaves the room. Skeeter, striding down a pathway, stops, the sun outlining her long, ringleted hair. She gazes mournfully at a stone bench under a weeping willow tree. In her mind's eye, she sees herself as a young, teenage girl sitting morosely on the bench.",
    "744": "A petite black woman with long plaits, Constantine, comes towards Skeeter, passing beneath the long, wispy branches of the willow. She smiles at her warmly as she sits down next to her. Constantine grips Skeeter by the hand, bringing a grateful smile to her face. Skeeter nods, with tears in her eyes. They walk out of the willow glade, and Constantine slaps an arm around Skeeter's shoulders. Skeeter walks back the same way she came, with a more relaxed pace, a thoughtful look on her face. Later, she's on the phone. Charlotte has traced the phone flex to the kitchen. Elegant, slim Ms. Elaine Stein is still on the phone. Skeeter replaces the receiver, grinning as if she'd just won the jackpot. Hilly's on Elizabeth's back porch, with a contractor. Aibileen glances up at a windy sky. Skeeter waits for Hilly to drive away and then looks pointedly at Aibileen. She hurries in with the laundry basket. They come into Elizabeth's kitchen. Elizabeth's husband, Raleigh, sees Skeeter sitting with Aibileen. Aibileen gets up from sorting the washing. Black storm clouds release heavy rain on Jackson. At Hilly's house, Minnie is fanning Mrs. Walters with a newspaper. She and Minnie glance towards the window and the storm raging outside. Mrs. Walters sits up her in chair, in awe. Mrs. Walters fixes Minnie with a look of confused comprehension. Hilly, who has been lighting candles on the dining table, sits fanning herself. Minnie puts down the paper and sidles to the window, looking out over the terrace and the outdoor toilet beyond it. She sees a sun chair being buffeted in the wind. The pool umbrella has gone the way of the chair. Minnie beats a hasty retreat. Mrs. Walters lays out some cards. Her daughter's eyes narrow as she watches Minnie disappear down the hall. In the bathroom, as Minnie softly raises the toilet lid, Hilly puts her ear to the bathroom door. Minnie, caught with her knickers down, freezes. Defiantly, Minnie flushes the toilet. Minnie stands with her arms folded, then slams down the lid. Mrs. Walters looks up from her cards without expression. Minnie, carrying her handbag, strides out of the front door, into the pouring rain. A child's bedroom turned upside down. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley on her lap, sheltering under an upturned mattress. In Elizabeth's sprawling bungalow the next day, Aibileen, in her maid's uniform, is sitting on the toilet. Flies buzz around her. She brings a hand to her mouth, her face perspiring, her expression world-weary. Elizabeth, holding Mae Mobley's hand, stands outside the wooden toilet, on the back porch. Aibileen picks the child up. Aibileen shuts the toilet door with her free hand.",
    "745": "Elizabeth waves to Mae Mobley and drives off. The little girl strokes Aibileen's cheek. Smiling softly, Aibileen kisses her on the cheek. They hug each other fondly. At a bus stop, several maids from the locality are climbing aboard. Minnie, in a green straw hat and spotty dress and carrying a pie and a fan, peers out from the door of an empty bus. Seeing the coast is clear, she gets out. Yule Mae, standing next to Aibileen, spots her. Minnie looks nonchalant. Skeeter strides up. Aibileen glances behind her at the bus door closing. She watches it drive off with a doom-laden look on her face. A white mother pushing a pram slows down as she passes. Aibileen takes the slip of paper. Aibileen trudges off. Skeeter studies a State of Mississippi pamphlet on the conduct of non-white and other minorities. Aibileen's voice reads the words. Aibileen answers. Minnie with her pie rings Hilly's doorbell. Hilly eyes the pie and loftily indicates she should wait. Minnie's face stiffens. She sinks to the floor. Aibileen rings off. Her eyes lighting on the paper with Skeeter's number propped up on the phone. In a church young Preacher Green invites the choir to stand. Aibileen thinks on his words. Later at home Aibileen hurries to the door. She ushers Skeeter in. She invites Skeeter to follow her to the sitting room of her spotless little house. Skeeter sits down on the sofa and unties the headscarf she's wearing. Aibileen stays standing. Aibileen in a yellow dress with elbow length sleeves and a scalloped detail down the front purses her lips with a faint sigh. Visibly nervous she pours tea from a white china pot into a china cup spilling a drop on the saucer. A silver spoon on a white napkin is set next to the cup and there's also a plate of jam tarts. As Skeeter takes hold of the cup Aibileen hastily wipes up the spill in the saucer. Smoothing the back of her dress Aibileen sits on the arm of an easy chair facing Skeeter. Skeeter at the kitchen table reads from a list of questions. Aibileen looks mournfully at the photograph of the graduate student. Skeeter follows her gaze. Aibileen turns away to face the window, blanked out by the strong sun outside. Aibileen puts down the cutlery she's holding and nods mutely. Aibileen seems to be conducting an internal dialogue with herself. Skeeter carefully considers the proposal. Aibileen produces a notebook and her reading glasses. She stands in front of Skeeter with the notebook open in her hands. Cracking a brief smile, she sits back down. They stifle their giggles. Sometime later Skeeter puts her notes in her briefcase.",
    "75": "We stay focused on a house, hearing someone lunging against the door, followed by the squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood. An ultra romantic image of shelter and peace is seen. Frogs or river noises are heard, then the sound of running footsteps. The children are centered, their backs to us, sprinting towards a boat, with a light mist present. We shoot over BESS'S turned photograph and over BIRDIE, close, passed out in his rocker. The children run through an open door in the background and JOHN runs up to BIRDIE. JOHN grabs BIRDIE'S shoulder; BIRDIE half-rises, falls face down on the floor, rears on one elbow to look up at him, and falls face down again. JOHN grabs BIRDIE by one ear, turning his face up, and BIRDIE looks up earnestly at JOHN. JOHN then takes PEARL by the hand and leads her into the night. We shoot from the river as they struggle through sumac and pokeberry weeds at the edge of the river, towards a skiff tethered to a willow. When they come opposite the skiff, PEARL, frankly bored, is yawning, dangling her doll. JOHN, finishing undoing the rope from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on pursuit. On the bank above, it is huge in the mist. A man, PREACHER, is going along a river lane on horseback, walking the horse away from us. We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse where JOHN and PEARL tether a boat in front of it. They are eating hot boiled potatoes. After a glance at JOHN and PEARL, they turn away towards a lane in the background. JOHN and PEARL proceed towards the house. We shoot from within the open door of the kitchen as JOHN and PEARL advance to the edge of the porch. A TIRED FARM WOMAN stands by the door, within. We shoot over her as she leaves the shot briefly, then re-enters and goes to them with a bowl of steaming potatoes. They take handfuls and make to eat, then turn away and walk towards the boat. She looks after them. PREACHER stands behind the flames; in the foreground, an OLD MAN sits profiled on a box. Other workers, all men, sit around the fire. A short silence follows as the other men look at PREACHER without liking. Then the old man spits into the fire, causing a spurt of steam. He comes down to the water with a full landscape in the background. We shoot over two sitting rabbits as they watch, their ears up. The skiff passes with PEARL playing with her doll and JOHN unsnarls a line. The skiff passes again. We pan to a big barn near the river, then a lighted house; willows along the shore.",
    "751": "People are reflected in the mirror of a shop changing room, peering in nervously. Dr. Mathison sits beside a black woman who's lying down, gazing into a blanket wrapped bundle. The woman smiles at the wriggling bundle. The doctor gently lifts the bundle and looks inside. Still reflected in the mirror, the doctor looks up at the saleswoman, then looks back at the baby, frowning. A man is leaning against a train window, staring out as the train pulls away from a station. The man straightens up and leans back in his seat, wearing a dark gray suit with the top button of his pale green shirt undone and his tie loosely knotted. The little hair he has is close shaved, leaving just a dark shadow. Glancing between the seats in front of him, he sees a little girl lying almost upside down, staring back at him. He grins at her, but the grin fades and he leans towards the window again, rubbing the inside corner of one eye wearily. A slim woman in her late 20s, wearing a blue top, stretches up to place her coat on the overhead rack. As she does, the top parts company with her black trousers, and the man gazes at her exposed white midriff and the section of ivy tattoo climbing through the gap between top and trousers. He flirtatiously slips off his wedding ring and drops it into his jacket pocket. The young woman sits down, glances at some leaflets, drops them in the seat pocket, straightens her shoulder-length brown hair, tucks down her top, sits back, and closes her eyes. The man looks down at the seat pocket in front of him, stretches forward, and picks up a magazine, then picks up the second magazine and looks at himself before passing it to her. The man looks down, swallows, and looks at her again, watching another train pass and looking down before turning to her again. They shake hands. She looks down at the magazine again, then looks up, her smile gone, folds and unfolds her arms, tucks her fist under her chin, and shows him her wedding ring. She stands, picks up the leaflets, and moves down the aisle of the train. His head drops, and he pulls his wedding ring from his pocket, hesitates for a moment before slipping it back on, and settles back in his seat. Glancing between the seat backs, David sees a little girl in front sitting up now, her blonde hair pulled off her face and held by yellow clips, watching him and smiling. He moves out of her sight towards the window and leans against it frowning slightly, his eyes close. Outside, trees and shrubs form a green backdrop along the trackside.",
    "755": "He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door. He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads. He kneels beside the boy pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring. The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down. In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator. Her knees are drawn up. The gown has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator. Her head lulls on one side. From the other side of the room, David looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips. He cross to the full length window and parts the curtains. After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape. He leans on the rail and looks over. The maintenance man in orange launches himself at David from inside the bedroom. David is hurled over the balcony. He lands on his face in water. He lifts his head. The black shiny surface on which he's lying begins to crease and sag. Water forms an ever larger pool around him. He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink. Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it. From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water. Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again. His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light. High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony. Darkness and light alternate under the water as David struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.",
    "757": "Her eyes follow him around the room, then her head turns to him as he gets into bed beside her. She looks into his eyes for a moment as he lays his head on her shoulder, before she turns back and gazes out beyond the foot of the bed. Her eyes close. Audrey opens her eyes again as David closes his, and his face relaxes. Joseph, in a green T-shirt with white and gold bands around the middle, walks downstairs and into the kitchen. Audrey and David are at the table, leaning towards each other, holding hands. They look around at him, smiling. David picks up the paper and Audrey, wearing a white T-shirt and green and white striped pajama bottoms, goes to the cooker. Joseph sits at the table, looking up at her cautiously. David continues to read the paper. She turns from the cooker. David continues to read, at last looking up and nodding. Joseph unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full. He replaces the cap and stands to remove the carton from the table. He sits again, staring at the glass. The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him. Joseph looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story. Joseph pulls the paper to him and reads. Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw. Joseph gazes down at the paper, his lips moving slightly. He looks up at David, mouth open. David nods expressionlessly. Joseph closes his mouth, swallows, and blinks hard. David puts a finger to his lips, and Joseph nods and wipes away a tear. David glances down, then looks up and gives Joseph a smile. At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests. Elijah is talking to a couple from his wheelchair. David wanders in wearing a casual brown jacket and open-neck shirt, glances around him, and stops in front of a picture. A black woman with gray hair approaches him, looks across the busy gallery. David looks across the busy gallery. Elijah's wheeling his chair from the gallery down the narrow corridor lined with comics. David is following. Elijah freewheels down a ramp into his office and swings the chair around to face David. He's wearing a tight black leather zip-up jacket with short glittering blue lapels. He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper. He looks at it and turns it round, showing David the drawing of the hero in the cape.",
    "759": "David sits alone at a table in a small, dimly lit kitchen, staring down at a spoon he's holding against the rim of a cereal bowl. He nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control, then walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs. From inside the room, his wife looks up at him. He stops and looks down at her. She's standing in front of an open drawer, drops her eyes momentarily, then looks up again, gently. He continues upstairs. Later, David, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177. In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit, and by the pulpit, photos cover a large board. Outside the church, David heads towards his car, stops and looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper. He turns the envelope over, frowning, before flicking open the unsealed flap, stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church. In a locker room, David opens one of the chipped green doors, stops in the doorway of an office and takes off his baseball cap. A gray haired woman with gold rimmed glasses is sitting at a computer. She glances at her computer screen, picks up a pen, makes a note and puts down the pen, still without looking at him. She returns to her work, still ignoring him. He pulls on his baseball cap and goes. A caped figure stands motionless in an archway, silhouetted black against the teeming rain, watching an American football training session. One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed, captures the ball thrown from behind and dives over the line, tosses the ball to another player and trots back again. Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, David sighs deeply. In the locker room, David towels his head and face, puts his towel away and glances to his right. An older man is in the doorway. David stares at the locker door, and then glances at Noel. In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp. David, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who's sleeping peacefully. A clock on the other side of the bed says a quarter to one. David stands at his wife's closed door. Audrey frowns and shakes her head. From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy. He's sitting in a strangely hazy living room, a photo on the wall behind, a corner table with a lamp on it.",
    "760": "The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead. Behind him the door opens, and a woman enters. She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him. They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted. She stands beside him, arms folded. The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face. The boy turns and looks at her. She stands and folds her arms again. He's hunched forward, head down. The boy lifts his head. The boy goes to the window. Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain link fence. An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him. Children chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it. Holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park. He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper. Inside is a brown cardboard box. The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down. In the box is a comic, upside down. Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue. The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers. The woman sits gently beside the boy. The boy continues to stare down at the comic. She looks away and back at him. He glances up at her for a moment. As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover. The dark haired young man in suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods. The young man grins. Elijah limps across the gallery using a cane. Elijah turns back to stare at the man. As he does, David strides towards the gallery with Joseph a few paces behind. Inside, Elijah is walking away from the door and doesn't look around. Elijah turns. They're sitting in an office. Joseph gazes up at his father. Joseph looks from David to Elijah, then gets up and goes. Elijah, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at David. David looks around as Joseph returns. David is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper. Joseph is asleep, lying across him. His head on David's chest. One arm flung around him. David lowers the paper and glances at his son. He closes the paper, and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.",
    "763": "He sits up, putting his head on one side quizzically. He turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar as Joseph walks up to him. David twists around to look at the other end of the bar while Joseph watches tensely. Joseph takes several paces back towards an open covered door. On the bench, David grips his hands out wider than his shoulders and takes the weight. He drops the bar slowly to his chest and pushes up until his arms are straight. He lowers the bar again and again straightens his arms, while Joseph stares. Finally, David drops the bar back onto the supports. David's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip. Even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time. David's frowning slightly. Joseph's standing in the cupboard. On his bench, David braces himself. He lowers the bar to his chest. Arms quivering, eyes tight shut, face twisted, he presses it up to full extension. He repeats the press and replaces the bar. Above the bar, Joseph's white face appears upside down to David. Joseph's standing two steps up the staircase. As the bar rises, two big paint cans appear taped to it next to the weights. David drops the bar back in its supports. His left arm flops to the floor. With his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright. Joseph comes down the stairs. He walks slowly over to David, who twists around to inspect the weights and the paint cans at either end of the bar. David's brow furrows. Joseph gazes at him in awe. Elijah is lying in a hospital bed, nodding almost imperceptibly. Inside, Audrey is sorting through papers on a reception desk. A nurse approaches her, pointing across the room. Audrey hands the nurse a yellow file, takes another one from her, and walks across the open plan office. She leans through a doorway and smiles. Sitting on a low couch in a treatment room, she looks up at Elijah who's watching her from his wheelchair, a metal frame keeping his right leg straight. The street outside the stadium is empty. Inside, along one of the shaded walkways, David, in his security uniform, is leaning on a wall, casually watching spectators as they crowd in through a gate. He looks away and stares at the ground. After a moment, he pushes himself off the wall and moves to the center of the walkway and stands there with his head down and his hands in his pockets. The crowd streams past him, laughing and smiling. They jostle and bump him, some almost pushing him aside, but he doesn't react. A large woman in a pink coat, blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, dragging a small boy by the hand, bangs into him.",
    "766": "The torch flows brightly, then gives way to the pitch black darkness of space. A shining parabola cuts through the inky blackness, and the curving edge of planet earth is illuminated, dwarfing further planets in the distance. The glowing rings of Saturn arc around the planet's central sphere, while fast solo flares erupt from the surface of the sun. Tendrils of white hot flame flicker around the billowing molten components. Whitout. Earth, a rainy night. The gates of the mine open and a taxi drives through. The passenger is the spectacled 30-something Adrian Hold. He spots a young boy sitting by a key, cuddling with a toy boat, and speaks to the driver. The driver ignores Adrian and drives through the puddle, smashing the boy and his boat. Inside the Institute of Astro Physics, University of New Delhi, they stand on a rickety, descending lift. The lift reaches the bottom, where a bearded man has been switched over. Gurdeep grabs ice buckets. At a computer terminal, another computer screen displays the solar eruptions. Adrian frowns at the screen. Gurdeep pours ice around Doctor Lokesh's feet. A door opens into a dark chamber containing a water tank. Gurdeep helps Satin open up the large tank. Adrian stares down into the tank. The water inside bubbles and boggles. He arrives at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel, Washington D.C. Adrian takes a document from his bag. Barely 40-something Anheuser frowns at Adrian. A peeved looking Anheuser turns slowly and takes the document from Adrian's hand. He puts his drink down on a waiter's tray then walks off with the document, fishing a pair of glasses from his top pocket, on the way past Adrian. Anheuser reads the document in a quiet corner of the party. Adrian stands behind him. Anheuser frowns, looks up and turns. With Adrian's duffle bags still in his arms, Scotty watches Adrian follow Anheuser from the party. Day time, police try to control an anti-G8 protest. The car drives right across the spherical building. The distinguished looking 60-something US President Wilson enters the G8 Summit and scans around a large table where many other people are either standing or seated. An interpreter leaves the station. A large number of the other people present file out of the room. Wilson looks around as the double doors are closed behind him. Eight heads of state remain. Military choppers fly over the shoreline village. Locals board trucks. A young villager called Nima. Soldiers stop Nima's brother Tenzen from following the truck as it drives away. Villagers raise their hands. Tenzen raises his hat. The Kernel points. The villagers look up as controlled explosions detonate high in the mountains. MI Techs Officer Isaac arrives outside his suite.",
    "768": "Nema stops the truck and climbs out. He looks back down the road to where Jackson stands with arms raised. They run to the truck. On the ground, Captain Michaels leads Anheuser's team across a walkway. There are many other walkers with people crossing to the waiting arks. Nora sees them and addresses Anheuser. They spot the Saudi prince and his family. Anheuser walks off with Michaels. Nora pats Adrian's shoulder and follows them. Crowds trudge along the Nampan Plateau. Among them are Satnam and his family. They stop and look around to see a gigantic tsunami heading for the coastline. The huge waves tower over Satnam and head straight for the refugees. Adrian is shown into a cabin on the escape ship. He glances around and picks up a goblet. He takes his ringing mobile from his bag. Leaving his phone switched on, Satnam crouches down and holds his son's face in his hands. They're deep in prayer as the tidal wave comes closer. Satnam and his wife hug their son between them as Adrian listens. Adrian throws away the goblet. On the Arc bridge, Adrian rushes across the bridge to Scottie. The images have called up. Adrian turns to Anheuser. They look at another screen. Scottie hits a button. The old watch at the screen and now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds. Anheuser turns away. After moving his spectacles closer to a group of people sitting at another bank of monitors, a revised countdown appears on their screens. Nema drives the truck with his grandparents in the cab with him. In the back, Jackson is with his family, Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah lies asleep, his head resting on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon glances up and sees Jackson watching them. Gordon stares ahead and speaks without looking at Jackson. He turns his head. They pass a sign utility gate 17 east. Nema stops the truck. Tenzen opens the gate. Nema looks over his shoulder. She nudges the kids forward. Kate spots Nema's grandma. Tenzen glances up at Lily and Noah. Then beckons them forward. Yuri and the others are in the ship bay. Yuri thumped the security guard as he looked behind. The crowd pushes past and enters the bay. Yuri overlooks the arc. Tenzen leads Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the mountainside as it opens revealing the ship bays. She calls on a passing science officer. Tenzen leads everyone up a launch tower staircase. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah head up the launchpad. Noah stares up at the anchors dangling from a gigantic ship's hull. The wind ruffles his hair. Jackson grabs Noah and they hurry up towards the ark. The Russian President is led onto an ark bridge by his interpreter.",
    "769": "He scans around. Chancellor looks out over the loading bay. Yuri leads a fast crowd running across the wide boarding platform. As Tenzen and the others board the ship, Grandpa slips. Jackson reacts and grabs his arm. Tenzen nods to Jackson. The crowd on the boarding platform reach a deep pit around the ark. A man plummets into the pit and the crowd stops running. On the ark bridge, outside the enormous rear life supports move into position. Nearby, Jackson and the others walk in towards the hedge. He looked down at the struggling crowd and the boarding platform below. Yuri says something. From down there up from high on the hull Tamara spots Caesar on the ground. Inside the hatch Jackson holds a torch as Tenzen unwinds a sealed shaft. Caesar makes it to Tamara as the outer hatch closes. Yuri watches angrily. She sticks a finger up at him. Then the hatch slams shut. Inside, Jackson, Gordon and the others shine torches as Tenzen shoulders a pneumatic drill. Nema looks up hopefully as Tenzen pulls open a round hatch. On the control bridge, Adriane and Laura watch horrified as members of the crowd outside plunge off the boarding platform into the pit. With a deep frown, Adriane crosses the bridge. Macarenka watches the screen on board his ark. Anheuser shakes his head at Adriane. Adriane looks down relieved. Anheuser hangs his head. Michaels picks up the phone on the control desk. In a darkened corridor, Tamara shines her torch on various animals in cages. As the gates open, a hydraulic ceiling lowers above them, knocking Gordon and Tenzen off a ladder. Jackson struggles to help the injured Tenzen and Gordon, who cling on just above grinding gears. Gordon is dragged between the wheels. Yuri stares up at the lowering gate. He reaches up from the lower ledge, and tries to haul himself back onto the boarding platform. Tanzen is trapped between the gears and the rapidly descending hydraulic ceiling. Jackson is trapped between a wire fence and the hydraulic ceiling. Tenzen's drill has become tangled in the gears. Sparks fly. Jackson reaches out in desperation as the hydraulic wall draws near to the gate. The gears grind into a halt. The wall stops. Hundreds of people leap onto the gate and board the Ark. Anheuser watches the chaos anxiously. He looks around with a digital camera. Flower petals blow from a bowl in the mountaintop monastery. Lama looks up from his seat on the floor as the wind picks up. He scans around. In the distance a gigantic wall of water crashes its way between the peaks of the snow-covered mountains. Lama rings the monastery bell as the water quickly closes in.",
    "772": "He stops for a security scan. Inside the opulent suite, Isaac sits opposite a Saudi prince who holds an electronic document in his hands. The prince wears a pair of sunglasses, the Techs reflected in them. The prince removes his sunglasses. A group of workers roll a storage crate through a darkened exhibition hall. They open the crate, which contains a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The workers replace the Mona Lisa with the replica. He shines a torch on the hanging replica. He shines the torch over the replica's colors, highlighting Mona Lisa's mouth. A TV broadcast shows a Mayan temple. Handsome, dark-haired, 30-something Jackson leaps off his couch where he was sleeping and rushes into his bathroom to clean his teeth. He answers the phone on his way out. Jackson silently curses his car and walks out of the garage. Jackson gets into a stretch limo with black dark windows and drives off past the surface. A jagged crack in the road stretches around the corner. Kids jump over it. He arrives at his ex-wife Kay's house. Standing on the ground way, the barrel looks stunned as the moored ship lists up and down dramatically in San Francisco Harbor. Passengers stumble as the boat's hull crunches into the docks. Ship stewards help passengers up as Harry and his friend Terry scan around, frowning. In bed, Laura wakes and answers her phone. Roland is driving. The back of Roland's car explodes as he is driving. The car flips forward and goes into flames. Jackson's limo rounds a corner on the way to Yellowstone National Park. Wilson looks across the Oval Office at Anheuser. Laura enters with a newspaper. A story about Roland's death. She turns on the TV. She ignores Adrian. Wilson eyes Anheuser who gets up to go. Adrienne follows. She sits down heavily on one of the sofas. President Wilson pulls up a chair and sits in front of her. He puts his hand over hers. At Yellowstone Park, Jackson drops his daughter Lily's hat over a fence then climbs after it. Lily and her brother, Noah, follow Jackson along a sparse trail. They arrive at a clearing with a parched lake basin in the middle. They head down to the cordoned-off basin which is bubbly and marshy underfoot. Big tripods have been positioned within the cordon. Jackson and the kids approach a dead, rotting stag. Stationed amongst the trees on a hillside, somebody watches the three of them through binoculars. Steam rises from the lake bed around Jackson. He takes his kids' hands as a conveyor army comes arising in the top in front of him. The watcher in the trees is a guy called Charlie Frost.",
    "780": "Guests gather for a wedding. A young bridesmaid sits and watches, then the two girls walk back down the aisle. The elder one admires herself in a mirror. The bride's dress is ripped. Jane gives a knowing smile and eyes the ribbon in Tess' hair. Jane proudly holds the train of the ribbon repaired dress. Carrying the bulky dress in a bag, adult Jane, in a formal purple dress, hurries out of the shop onto a busy New York street. Pausing for breath on a street corner, another young woman walks up wearing the same purple dress. Tess nudges her bored friend. Jane rushes out of the ceremony, hurries over to the cab, and starts getting changed in the back seat. The cabby looks in his mirror. They drive through the colorfully lit New York night, pulling up below the Brooklyn bridge. She gets out of the cab wearing a red sari and places a jeweled bindi on a friend's forehead. Flinging herself back into the cab, she frantically starts changing again. The cabby sneaks another look. She's back at the first wedding. A handsome, dark-haired guy who was at the ceremony watches her with raised eyebrows as she heads off in the cab again. She's dancing, first in her Indian dress, then after another dive for the cab, in her purple one. After some energetic dancing, she emerges from another cab ride, once more in her Indian finery. She kicks off the wrong shoes. The cabby throws her the right ones. She joins in some choreographed dancing. Later on, she catches the sari in the cab door. She helps both brides with their dresses as they sit on their toilets. She gets back into the swing of the choreography, the Jewish Indian party, then rushes in disarray into the other wedding just as the bride and groom are stuffing cake into each other's mouths. It's a bindi. Jane smiles in delight, arms outstretched, as the bridal bouquet is thrown and sails straight towards her. Then she's barged to the floor by an over-zealous competitor. Everything goes black. As Jane comes hazily to, the dark-haired guy is looking down at her. She blinks up at him and touches a hand to her sore head as two other guests arrive. She gives a tight smile. She sways unsteadily, clutching her head. The lights at the city twinkle in the night as the pair share a cab. They sit as far apart as possible, a huge bunch of flowers between them. She pays. Kevin grabs the flowers. The truck drives between them. As Kevin sits in the cab smiling to himself, he looks down and notices Jane's filofax on the floor. Looking thoughtful, he opens the filofax.",
    "782": "Jane goes to the bathroom to moisturize her hands and then does some work at her laptop. She shuffles papers and glances at the door. She does some sit-ups, puts on rubber gloves, and cleans the cooker. Jane struggles with her emotions. The next day, the sisters arrive at Hell's hardware store. Jane lets the door close on Tess. Her father stares at Jane's agonized expression. As Tess and George flirt in his office, Jane frowns, seeing Kevin's name in her filofax. Jane dials Kevin's number. Grinning, Kevin hangs up. A youngster with a baseball glove comes in. Pedro frowns. They arrive at the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports ground. Jane stares at her. Pedro, practicing his catching, grins at them from the baseball field. Jane rolls her eyes in disbelief. A large bunch of yellow flowers is delivered. Jane hands them to Tess with a tight smile. She brings a pile of paperwork to George's office. She grins as he talks happily on the phone. Her smile fades as she notices pictures of him and Tess on the desk. They all have dinner at Jane's father's house. As Tess chatters and the men smile, Jane unhappily stuffs her face with food. At her apartment, she catches Tess and George kissing on the couch. Looking crushed, she leaves them to it and goes out again. Attending a leather and bondage wedding, Jane, sporting a spiked leather collar, tries to appear in party mood. She gamely flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who, grinning, do the same. As they kiss, Jane looks mortified. Casey catches her eye, looks over at the lovebirds. George holds up two ties for her approval. He nods, tight-lipped, as she knots the tie. She smiles after him and heads back to her desk. In the evening at the office, Jane tidies away some files on George's desk. Underneath, she finds his wallet. Consulting his appointments, she heaves a sigh and leaves. A taxi pulls up outside a restaurant and Jane gets out. It's Tess' turn to look stunned. Jane is at a loss. There's a small white box tucked in the dog's collar. The box contains a diamond ring. He slips the ring on her finger and they kiss as Jane stands helplessly nearby. It's a wedding dress. Jane meets up with Kevin in a bar. She looks pleased with herself. He takes her hand. Jane stares in shock across the Central Park boating lake. They go back to their yoga. There's a meeting at the New Warsaw bakery. It's Kevin clapping. She grabs Kevin's arm. Jane looks tearful, but pulls herself together. Kevin looks down a street past a shop and up the steps to Jane's building.",
    "784": "Kevin arrives and stares at Jane, then starts to sneak off. George spots him, and Kevin turns, feigning surprise. Jane's smile fades. Later, headlights blazing, the aging Volvo speeds through the rainy night. The car swerves alarmingly and slides backwards down a grassy slope, just missing a tree. Coming to a halt, they sit frozen in shock. Tires spin, digging into the wet ground. They stick their cell phones out of the windows trying to get a signal. They sit not looking at each other. Kevin and Jane arrive soaking wet at a bar. Jane checks the public telephone but indicates with a roll of her eyes that it's not working. They head to the bar, and he flops onto a barstool. Two empty glasses hit the bar. She grins at him, then gawks at him. It's his turn to be taken aback. They grin tipsily. The locals start to enjoy their goofy performance. They're up on the bar with everybody gathered round, singing and urging them on. Jane is barefoot, and Kevin keeps coming up with wacky dance moves. Kevin jumps down, leaving Jane dancing wildly to the delight of the crowd. Kevin then helps her down. She lurches drunkenly, and he stops her from falling. They stare into each other's eyes, then Jane kisses him hard and passionately. They carry on kissing in the Volvo and tearing off each other's soaking wet clothes. The next day, Kevin strolls down the grassy slope carrying two coffees. The early sun reflects off the windows, and Jane is still asleep in the mud-spattered car. He looks around, acting nonchalant. They go to a diner. Kevin's expression freezes. Jane crumples up the paper, throws it at Kevin, and leaves. She stares at him with bitter disappointment, then turns on her heel and leaves. He walks back to the diner, his face in his hands. Later, he strides into the newspaper offices and approaches Maureen. He leaves, angry and frustrated. Jane arrives at her apartment. She overturns a chair. She throws the phone, screws up the paper, and stomps on it. Jane sits staring miserably into space. At the office, she picks up her messages. She runs her hands through her shoulder-length hair and throws her arms defensively. Casey comes in. They exchange a worried look, and Jane walks slowly towards George's office. He places a caring hand on her shoulder to escort her out. Tess is at the bridal shop. Jane is puzzled. Jane walks over to Tess looking horrified. Tess looks puzzled as Jane walks out. Tess pouts and flounces back to her fitting room, tripping over her hem as she goes. As lights begin to decorate the evening cityscape, a taxi drops Jane off at the restaurant where guests are gathering for the engagement party.",
    "788": "The vans up the roadside. As he gets closer, he sees it's Marcus waving a torch. Gin stops in front of Marcus, who moves his Stetson and gets out of the car with a wary expression. He shakes his head weirdly. Marcus gives him a helpless look. Gin heads back to his car and Marcus smiles. Gin lifts the bonnet of his Chevy. Bonnet up, Gin steps back from the car. Marcus steps forward with the jump leads but can't reach the battery. Marcus backs away from between the car and the van as Lois starts the van up. Gin leans back against the grill of the Chevy and lights himself a smoke. Marcus nods to Lois and she drops the van into gear, hits the gas, and crushes Gin between the two vehicles. Lois reverses and Gin slithers down the grill of the Chevy onto the ground. Marcus walks up to him. Marcus sighs and walks to the van. He removes the jump start cables from the van, returns to Gin and clips them onto his ears. Back at Thurman's, Willie opens the front door to Sue, who's got a bag of groceries. He eyes her figure appreciatively. In the kitchen, Thurman and Willie make necklaces out of pieces of popcorn. She adds it to a big bowl. In the hall, Sue stands on a chair to put decorations on the tree. Willie stares, mesmerized by her backside, and begins fondling it. She pushes his hand away, so he reaches up and unzips the back of her skirt. She quickly does it back up and gives Willie a kiss. In the lounge, Grandma has conked out on the sofa. Sue carefully removes her slippers and then peels off her sheer, hold-up socks. She hands one to Willie, and they pin the socks up at the fireplace. They exchange a smile and leave Grandma to slumber on. Later, Willie is at the front of the house lighting the candle bags Herb had come around organizing. Thurmond comes out of the house and walks over to Willie as one of the bags catches alight. Willie stamps out the blazing bag. Willie looks around awkwardly. Thurmond looks down sadly, and Willie relents. Bemused Willie shakes his hand. Thurmond hurries off into the house, and Willie allows himself a faint smile. Once Thurmond is gone, Willie turns around and goes back to lighting the candle bags. In the mall, all the security guard bids the last shoppers farewell. Lois is amongst the shoppers. She makes a show of looking at a price tag on a table laden with sweaters, and, at the same time, pushes the table into a new position. She makes a minor adjust to its position and heads off.",
    "79": "A barn stands in the background at sunrise. JOHN awakes from sleep, huddled with others. They rise and move into the kitchen. RACHEL and JOHN watch a moment before approaching the stove. RACHEL places her gun beside the stove and picks up a coffee-pot while JOHN puts kindling in the stove. JOHN pauses to look at her. They turn towards a sound. Two TROOPERS are seen as sirens grow loud, rapidly approaching RACHEL'S house. RACHEL, holding JOHN'S hand, moves down to the fence with the other CHILDREN following. A car brakes. The TROOPERS spread out and advance towards the barn, with RACHEL and the CHILDREN grouped behind them. The barn door is open. After a pause, PREACHER appears. The TROOPERS surround PREACHER, and one hits him with a pistol-barrel. A DOLL bursts open, spilling money over PREACHER. Two TROOPERS gently lift JOHN away. RACHEL carries JOHN towards the house, his head hanging back. About ten faces are present, most frenetic, while two LOAFERS enjoy the scene. A general hubbub and a gavel sound off-screen. JOHN looks towards the gavel. The noise stops. JOHN looks at a finger, then is helped from a chair by a LAWYER and given to RACHEL. RACHEL pantomimes a watch. Everyone in the cafe stands up. RACHEL gathers her parcels. ICEY opens the door, shouts into the cafe, then turns to a street mob. RACHEL hurries her CHILDREN to the door. ICEY leaves the door to yell at the mob.

    "794": "They knock their drinks back, and Willie puffs on his cigarette. She nods and looks at his glass. She pours him another shot, and then one for herself. They down them in one. She gives him a coy look. And he does, in his beaten up old car. After the festive fornication, Willie leans against the car having a smoke. She gets out of the car and faces him. He half smiles and nods. She gives him a smile and heads off. Once she's gone, the moody looking Indian guy from the bar runs over and shoves Willie. Curly head Fat Ass pulls Mr. Not Gay off Willie. Mr. Not Gay marches off into the night. Willie catches his breath and turns to Fat Ass. Fat Ass turns to him. Sometime later Willie gives Fat Ass a lift and left home in his knacker old car. Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at him and smiles warmly. Willie looks away from it. Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at Willie. Willie turns off his engine and one working headlight, then gets out of the car with the kid. Willie admires the affluent suburban house they're in front of. Willie frowns. As the kid unlocks the door, Willie pulls out a cotch and puts on a black balaclava. Inside, Grandma is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit. Grandma walks past Willie, apparently unmoved by the fact that Santa is wearing a black balaclava. Willie turns to the kid. The kid nods. Willie pulls up his balaclava. He sure does. Willie opens it and removes wads of cash and a passport. Willie shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair. The credulous kid beams at him. The very nice BMW which Willie drives away in.

Marcus gives Bob a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on his desk as he goes. Later, Marcus wanders through a restaurant in the mall sipping a coke. He spots Willie putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine. Willie thrusts his crotch into the blonde. The BMW. As he opens the car door, a pile of empties spill out. He drives off crashing them on his wheels. Bob is with Gin, the security chief. Gin eats an orange. Bob winces at the phrase.",
    "799": "Rows of old film studio buildings reflected in a shiny, gold surface. A shaky animation of a figure wearing a long coat and a hat runs towards light, its arms spread out and become wings, taking flight and coming to rest as a bird. Al-Saleem, a bearded man wearing a loose-fitting robe and a pale cream cap, speaks on a television in a house where three young Middle Eastern men listen. On a cordoned-off street, a policeman pats the roof of a milk float that drives off. Armed special branch officers dressed in black run across wasteland, while more officers huddle on a street corner as the milk float drives around. Officers make their way upstairs at the back of a boarded up house and train their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman stops and picks up some pints of milk. A marksman on the roof takes aim. Daylight floods through windows into the gloomy house. The milkman walks up to the front door and puts two pints of milk on the doorstep. One of the armed officers opens the back door and enters, alerting the three men inside where bomb making equipment is spread out on a table. One of the officers points at the ceiling. One of the men presses a key on a mobile phone, triggering a golden fireball that rips through the building. Police and civilians dive for cover as debris rains down, thick gray smoke fills the air, and plumes of smoke rise into the air. Letters emerge from brief flashes of grainy surveillance footage, showing densely packed buildings bisected by streets. A casually dressed young man with a beard, Ferris, lies on a bed, deep in troubled thought, his brow pinched, recalling sitting in a room, watching as a prisoner is gagged and beaten to death with a cricket bat. In a large house, a craggy faced guy in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop. Ferris cocks a pistol. A car is blown up and a soldier is shot. Hoffman talks to officials. Ferris, wearing jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street cafe, sipping coffee. A four-by-four pulls up, the driver, Bassam, has long black hair and a ponytail and yells to Ferris. Ferris picks up his bag and his coffee and gets in the four-by-four, sipping his coffee as Bassam drives. They encounter a checkpoint on a dirt road and are watched. Ferris looks at a stone house through binoculars, with goats swarming around in front. Bassam calls on his mobile and they're watched on a screen in a CIA surveillance room.",
    "803": "Bassam gets out and gives Ferris the finger before walking down the track. Ferris then gets out and, in the surveillance room, stands by a wall. He takes out his cell phone and looks at it, seeing something glinting in the sky. The Predator drone, an unmanned surveillance aircraft, is flown to a higher altitude. Meanwhile, Bassam walks along the track with Nizar, who gets in the front of the vehicle while Ferris, sitting in the back, eats an orange. Nizar looks down anxiously, then looks away, before opening his mouth and looking ahead thoughtfully. He unzips his coat, takes out a computer disk, and offers it to Ferris. Ferris watches the disk on his laptop, and Al-Saleem appears on the screen. Ferris makes a call on his cell phone as Hoffman is sitting on his yacht, moored by a jetty near his large house. Hoffman's wife comes out of the house. Ferris hangs up, puts on his shades, and walks down the track to Bassam and Nizar. Ferris aims his gun. Hoffman sits staring at a surveillance screen, on which Ferris and Bassam, both using cell phones, watch Nizar ride along a busy street in a town on a moped. The guys shoot Nizar, and he falls. The four men pick up the injured Nizar and carry him to the back of the van. Ferris aims a pistol and shoots Nizar in the head, then runs. The surveillance screen shows the scene from above. Hoffman takes a call from Ferris, who walks with Bassam. Bassam and Ferris drive along a dirt road and stop at the top of a hill. Bassam reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris creeps up behind some rocks and takes out his binoculars, looking down at a collection of stone houses. A man stands by a fire on which a pile of CDs and cassettes is burning. Ferris radios Bassam, who gets a rifle from the back of the four-by-four. Wearing traditional robes, a jacket, and a skull cap, Ferris walks down the hill toward the Iraqi by the fire. Bassam gets down by some rocks and pulls out the rifle's stand. The man at the fire sees Ferris and frowns. Ferris speaks Arabic and looks around. Bassam looks through a telescopic sight at Mehdi, a bearded man, as he walks out and shoots him. Ferris kills the man by the fire. A man pops up from behind a wall, and Bassam shoots him. A young man runs out of the house, gun blazing. Bassam drives down and makes a call. Ferris throws a grenade into a courtyard and runs in shooting. He exchanges fire with the young man. Two choppers fly towards the scene. The young man peers out from behind a wall.",
    "804": "Ferris shoots him and runs to the house. He enters the house with his gun held out in front. He turns a corner and sees a man holding a detonator with wires attached. Ferris shoots him and runs out. As the house blows up, Ferris is thrown off his feet. The black choppers fly above a winding river, then a forest. Bassam drags Ferris to the four-by-four. Ferris burns his hand as he grabs CDs and cassettes from the fire. Bassam drags him to the four-by-four, throws him in the back and drives off. Explosions rip through the buildings. Two four-by-fours drive towards Ferris and Bassam. Ferris cocks a rifle. Ferris shoots at the other vehicles as they approach. They collide on a bend and ram into a rock. Bassam drives off along a dirt road. The two choppers fly over the desert. Ferris keeps shooting at the Iraqis as they follow in the four-by-fours. Bassam radios. The choppers fly overhead. An Iraqi in each of the pursuing four-by-fours loads a rocket-propelled grenade into a launcher. Ferris leans out of the window and shoots at them. The RPG grazes a chopper and the chopper destroys one of the four-by-fours. The other four-by-four gains on Ferris and Bassam. The chopper fires a rocket which destroys the second four-by-four and knocks Ferris and Bassam's four-by-four onto its roof. It slides to a stop in the dirt, throwing Ferris about in the back. One of the choppers lands. A soldier runs to Ferris. Ferris is hauled into the chopper. A soldier knocks Ferris out with an injection and the chopper takes off. Ferris lies by the open hatch. His face splattered with blood. Lying in a hospital, Ferris remembers being with Bassam and his family. The Iraqi prisoner being beaten to death. A doctor leans over Ferris, who wakes. In a yard outside, soldiers are playing basketball. Using tweezers, the doctor picks a sharp fragment from an open wound in Ferris' arm. He puts it with many other fragments in a kidney bowl. U.S. Military Base, Qatar, Persian Gulf. Ferris sits outside. Ferris takes a phone from the agent. Ferris frowns and stares intensely. Ferris hangs up and looks down. There's a bandage around his left forearm. He picks at a small bloody wound and digs out a splinter of bone. He holds up the tiny pointed fragment on his fingertip for a moment. Ferris opens a matchbox and drops the fragment into it. Deep in thought, he rubs his hands together. A grand boulevard with palm trees along strips of grass running between the lanes of traffic. Ferris is in a dirty black BMW with a heavy-set guy wearing shades, Skip.",
    "806": "Ferris pulls himself free and clambers over the wall. He makes a call as he limps across wasteland. Skip parks the BMW on a busy street, and he and Ferris get out. They walk into a health clinic. In a treatment room, Ferris sits up on a bed. A doctor attends to him. The doctor leaves and the pretty young nurse, Aisha, walks in. She gets a packet from a cabinet and goes to Ferris. She looks at the deep, bloody bites on Ferris' leg. She looks at his bloody hands and cut arm. He smiles, and she prepares a syringe. She walks around to him, smiling. Ferris studies her as she holds up the syringe and flicks it. He winces as she injects him in the stomach. He calls Hoffman. Hoffman gets in his car next to his daughter. Two men in suits open gates and the Mercedes drives into a courtyard. It stops behind another car which Hani is leaning against, smoking. Ferris gets out of the Mercedes looking a little apprehensive. He walks up to Hani. He throws his cigarette away. Hani leads Ferris along a corridor. Hani goes to a door with a window in it and knocks on the glass. On the other side, a man lowers a flap and Ferris looks into the room. Hoffman's agent, Zayed Ibishi, is naked and tied down on a table. A man whips him. Ferris turns away. Ferris watches the flogging, his eyes narrowed. A young man wearing a black kufi wheels a bicycle with heavily laden panniers out onto a street. He stops by some bins, lifts the lid of one of them and takes out two paper cups. He takes a piece of paper from one of the cups. The young man wheels his bicycle away. Noordermarkt. A bustling, covered marketplace. People are crowded in the street and around flower stalls. A young man with his black hair swept back locks a car, then notices a tourist lining up a photograph. Head down, the man briskly walks past the tourist, pressing the keys of a mobile phone. The car explodes, sending shock waves through the marketplace. Black and white frame-by-frame images of the explosion, which is blanked out by static. Smoke hangs over the marketplace. Ferris, in his apartment, and Hani, at home with his wife, watch the news. Al-Saleem watches the report. Ferris meets Marwan. Ferris looks at Hani, who's sitting in his car. Ferris sits in the back next to Hani and Marwan shuts the door. They drive across the desert in a convoy of black cars. The photos Ferris showed Hani. On a vast expanse of brown earth, a suited man stands beside a kneeling figure, whose head is covered with a black hood.",
    "81": "We watch the two sleeping faces for a moment more. We are in Peacock Alley, a tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century remnant of the old river civilization, left behind by general progress. They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk and look towards the voices, Pearl friendly, John hostile. Several stick their heads around the edge of the Schoolhouse door and chant at the Harper children. Another, next to the door, is drawing something on the wall. Over these lines, we cut briefly to chanting and drawing. The artist completes in chalk a large simple sketch of a man hanging from gallows. As the verse ends, we cut to them looking towards our children; John pays them no attention. John takes Pearl's hand. We shoot them through the window of Miz Cunningham's second-hand store. The back of a watch is silhouetted large in the foreground; John's eyes instantly fix on it; in the background, the school-children finish their song and vanish, giggling, into the schoolhouse. A watch with a moving sweep-hand is ticking. Over a shop-doorbell, we hear: Pearl watches her; John, the watch. He walks off fast as we dolly behind them; he leads Pearl, who hugs her doll. A few paces in silence; now they come to the big window of Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor. Willa's face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them away. He keeps her strolling. Walt Spoon comes out, proffering two lollipops. A short, lighted, toy-like train departs the town along the river-bank, whistling. The whistle ties over the previous. A square, head-on shot features river water below and vibrant starlight above; a gas-lamp by the road; a tree; and pretty tree-shadows which work across a window. Pearl lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder. John sits on the edge of the bed, in his underwear. He moves, and as his shadow moves away, we see the shadow of Preacher, motionless. Pearl sits up and points at it. John notices her and sees it. We pan John to the window. He looks out. He stands motionless. He turns and we pan him to bed. People are waving from shore and boat. We pan her into frame, Uncle Birdie Steptoe's toy-like little wharf-boat. As she passes broadside, we cut to the boat passing. Birdie's head sticks through a porthole. He is a wiry old river character. The boat whistles. As Birdie speaks, we pan John and a foundered skiff into a two-shot with. We pan John from skiff to wharf and Birdie's door. John enters and sits on a box. Birdie, in a ramshackle rocking chair, pours coffee. He gives John a cup of coffee.",
    "813": "A stampede occurs. Handbags, shoes, and gloves are up for grabs. A woman grabs and snatches a pair of tall pinkie boots that Rebecca had put down. Rebecca jumps on the woman. At home, with her head bowed, Rebecca sits contemplating a mountain of shopping bags in front of her, including the Gucci boots. A message from Luke demanding an outline pops up on her laptop. She looks at her watch, then slumps down at her desk in front of her laptop. Idly, she pulls a coat from one of her bags. Her face folds as she reads the label. She looks at an empty photo frame on Luke's desk. Luke regards her with a twinkle in his eye. Hayley brings Rebecca a note. Luke picks up the phone. Hayley rushes back in. Rebecca clambers onto the slippery boardroom table on all fours and propels herself at the phone. Later in his office, with Hayley in attendance, Luke looks earnestly into Rebecca's face. He glances dubiously at Hayley. Rebecca smiles meekly. At her desk, she opens a letter. At her home, Rebecca's smiling dad magics a coin from behind her ear and puts it into her outstretched hand. He sits down on an easy chair that tips back. Rebecca's expectant smile freezes. A recreational vehicle comes crashing around the corner with Graham at the wheel. Rebecca's face brightens. At the office, Wilson looks at an Asian Web page. She wears a flirty, fishing-for-something kind of expression. Suze tries on a frothy white tulle wedding dress. Suze's mom tries on her veil. Yawning with exhaustion, Luke steps into a lift to join Alette swathed in fur and leggy Alicia. Alette sweeps out. Alicia trips and falls into Luke's arms. In Miami, Florida, home to sun-kissed beaches and a marina full of private boats, Luke and Rebecca are at a magazine conference. Alicia goes off in a huff. Smiling women crowd around Rebecca. She grins across at Luke, whose eyebrows shoot up with amusement. A waitress hands her a cocktail. Rebecca notices a man's name tag, a bony-faced, sandy-haired man. She nose-nuzzles him in Eskimo style. Luke leaves her to it. She peers blankly at Janne. Luke, glancing over, sees him waiting for an answer. She slaps Janne's face. Alicia, pouring champagne, misses the glass as she watches in horror. Rebecca answers her mobile. She glances around furtively, on a breezy terrace. She takes a deep, deep breath. She takes Luke to a men's store. He slumps on a seat and shoots her a look. She recoils. She straightens his bow tie and helps him on with a black tuxedo. She sits down and faces him. He pulls her onto the dance floor, puts one arm around her waist, and clasps her right hand in his left hand.",
    "814": "**Narrative:**\n\nHe steps forward. She grasps his shoulder and tosses back her long, straightened hair, then steps back as he steps forward. Her high-heeled, sandaled feet fall in with his dance step. Holding both her hands in his, he twirls her towards him, twisting her arms across her waist. Keeping their heads still, they move around in a circle. She unravels from his hold, whacking his cheek with her fan and slapping his face with her long, tossing hair. Resuming their initial position, holding waist and shoulder, they whirl altogether. She leans back seductively and flicks the fan. Luke looks both startled and pleased as she flutters her eyelashes at him from behind the fan. He spins her again. Breaking from his hold, she dances an improvise solo, waving the fan in front of her chest, her waist, and even her bottom. Luke smiles awkwardly, vaguely claps his hands to accompany his unpredictable dancing partner. Suddenly, she disappears only to reappear behind him, swaying wildly from side to side, all the while waving the fan in front of her. He tries to reconnect. She whacks him again, but then settles back in his arms. Later, they walk back to their hotel. Alicia, sipping champagne on a sofa in the lobby, uncrosses her endless legs. She struts towards him. She strokes and kisses his cheek. Rebecca turns away, trying to mask her disappointment. New York, she sits glumly in the back of a Yellow Cab as it crosses Times Square. Her chin resting on one blue cashmere-gloved hand, she answers her mobile. Rebecca dives to the floor of the cab. She finds her black and white dress. Suze is propelled across the room and buried under the avalanche of clothes. Tall D. Freak smiles at his neighbor. Rebecca, wearing her sample blue gloves, faces the group. At home, Rebecca runs to the fridge and frantically searches through the freezer. She brings out a huge block of ice in the middle of which is a credit card. She smashes the block onto the counter and the floor, and bangs at it with a yellow stiletto heel and then a thicker wooden heel. She holds the now smaller block onto the floor and wrestles with it. Using two hair dryers, she melts it down, and eureka! Armed with the card, she goes to store and spots a cute melon-shaped bag. It's the group leader. Rebecca waves at Lainley. The group leader clutches a shoe to her forehead. The night of the ball. Luke, Alicia, and Rebecca ride up in the lift. Rebecca is a beaded black and silver jacket. Alicia glances down at her and smiles. The lift doors open onto a sumptuous ballroom.",
    "816": "Alicia joins them as they look at the flouncy purple dress, cringing at the sight of it. Alette considers the dress, then hands Alicia Rebecca's bag. Long-legged Alicia is left holding the bag, which she slams down before slumping next to it. Her eyes narrowing, she opens the bag and picks up the mobile. Rebecca, looking nervous, emerges from the changing cabin in the purple dress. Alette nods and Rebecca smiles at her reflection in the mirror, then looks at the label of the dress. Alicia watches her with a smug smile. In the bridal shop, Rebecca, in a pink maid of honor dress, is blind-folded, with a petticoat that is blue and green. Suze spots a Barney's carrier bag. As Rebecca runs down the street with two store bags, a black car draws up. A tall, silver-haired woman in a beret gets out and Rebecca runs into the meeting. The smart, silver-haired woman sits down, and looks round at the group, holding up Rebecca's shopping bag. The group comes to a thrift shop where Ryuichi puts up his hand. The basketball player picks her up and shakes her, then she runs back to the thrift shop, but the surly girl is in a wheelchair. Graham switches on his TV and Jane elbows him with excitement as the studio audience turns to look at him. Rebecca covers her face and Smeath's jaw drops while Tarquin chokes on his cereal. Smeath waves the list of excuses at the studio audience. Rebecca, sitting next to Luke, gives him a helpless look, her eyes brimming with tears. Seeing Luke's disappointed face, she shuts her eyes, and bows her head. He strides out of the TV studio. Miserably she wanders home in her purple dress and Yves Saint Laurent coat. Suze bursts out of the front door to meet her. The bag lady, with the shopping trolley, comes by in a pink dress with a green and blue petticoat. Rebecca searches for an explanation, her face crumpling. Luke pauses, suddenly derailed by his own feelings. Graham and Jane's mobile home pulls up outside Rebecca and Suze's building. Mr. West eyes Luke and Ryan smiles unpleasantly. Luke looks blown away. Rebecca, wandering along a wintry lake shore, is a tiny dot in the distance. Jane and Graham are by their mobile home, and Jane brings out a book. Graham joins Rebecca by the lake shore. She shoots him a look. Looking up into her dad's jowly face, looking at her with fierce deep love, Rebecca smiles. He puts an arm around her, and she lays her head on his big barrel chest. Tears roll down Jane's face as she watches her giant of a husband standing facing the lake, with his arm around Rebecca. At home, Rebecca finds a note from Suze. Glumly she steps into the room and looks at all the clothes piled up on the bed.",
    "817": "She slumps down and gazes miserably at a photograph of herself and black-haired Suze laughing together. In his office, Luke picks up the empty photo frame from his desk and looks at it with a sigh, then adds it to the other personal things he's put in a cardboard box. Alicia appears at his door. Meanwhile, Graham brings Alette a cup. Jane can't do tiny as all eyes are on her while she cuts a millimeter slice. Alette's perfectly made up eyes blink, and she gives a Gallic shrug. Luke is in a bank, then at a shopaholic meeting where the door bursts open, and group members put up their hands. At Dantay-West, Allon, the receptionist, gets an email about a sale and auction by the girl in the green scarf. At her desk, Haley looks at her inbox, and her eyes widen. She's holding a piece of paper behind her back, which Luke leans over and snatches from her. It's the attachment Allon forwarded to all employees, and he keeps the ad, looking at it with a sober expression. Meanwhile, the shopaholics group are getting the auction items ready. With crazed eyes, Haley jumps out of a cab and dashes to join a queue of women standing outside the church building where the sale is taking place. Graham is on door duty, and Allon is first in line. Graham demonstrates a red ensemble, D. Freak is on hats, and Miss Korch produces the green scarf. Haley sends a text, and Rebecca suddenly seems hesitant. She grabs back the scarf, walks towards the blonde purchaser, and places it in her outstretched hands, looking at her intriguingly. Jane and Graham look on proudly as the blonde, smiling coyly, waves the scarf at the applauding women. Rebecca looks distraught. Later, Graham counts the takings. Derek Smeath strides into his office, the staff watched him pass with po-faced curiosity. He looks back at them through his old-fashioned, black-rimmed specs, his pace slows, and an employee, seeing him draw near, ducks into an unseen office. Smeath, scowling, wipes his mouth and turns to the door of his own office. Rebecca's at his desk, and all the money is in jars of coins. It's the day of the wedding. A photographer on the decorated front steps of the church snaps the maids of honor arranging Suze's wedding train. One of them wears blue, the other pale green, and the third is in red. A figure in pink hurries up, and Suze turns around and looks coldly at Rebecca. Rebecca, wearing a pink tulle veil, looks imploringly at Suze, then turns towards the street where the bag lady, standing with her trolley, twirls around in Rebecca's favorite pattern jacket. Suze's eyes mist over, and with a relieved smile, Rebecca whips off her spotted shrug.",
    "82": "He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour, he pauses at Bess's photograph. It stands in a cabinet frame: a fine-looking young woman in archaic dress, with sharp, accusing black eyes. He turns the picture away and splashes liquor into his coffee. They drink. John looks cautious. Birdie's face falls; he takes another drink. John puts his cup down and gets up. He heads for the door, runs up the bank, not looking back, and runs up the street close to Spoon's, stopping dead. He is horrified by what he sees. Through the door-glass, from John's viewpoint, Preacher, Willa, and Pearl surround a little table. Walt stands by, puffing his pipe. Icey, in the background, stirs fudge at a little soda-fountain stove. Willa looks both moved and pleased. Pearl, shyly flirting with Preacher, all but hides in Willa's skirts. Preacher dandles Pearl's doll on his knee as he talks. All the grownups are avid for his words, which aren't heard through the glass. John quietly enters, and they look casually at him, continuing their talk. John enters the shot and stands at the fringe of the group, staring at Preacher's hands and the doll. Preacher hands the doll to Pearl. John's eyes follow the doll. Preacher holds up both hands to John. John looks back at his hands. John stands still. They are impressed in their different ways. Slight applause from the adults. Preacher takes Pearl, with her doll, onto his lap. He does a little take. His eyes twinkle palely. Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them. A tight silence. Icey pours fudge into a buttered pan. There are few men in proportion to women and children. Preacher is centered in the shot. The women watch him and admire him. He gives Willa the eye and Willa looks wooed and self-conscious. Icey enters the shot and whispers and beckons Willa and, as the singing continues, they leave the group and start towards a shade tree in the medium ground. They walk; singers in the background. Willa nods. Icey, looking ahead, is displeased. They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed by the tree trunk. They look around. Icey and Willa enter the shot, their backs to us. They sit on the bench, their back to us. The children recede towards the river in the background. Willa meekly keeps her head down. Singing continues off-screen. Icey pivots and we pan over her to children by the river. John looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie. His brow is furrowed. He skims another pebble.",
    "821": "Jacob cocks his head, then nods. Cal sighs heavily and turns to Jacob. Jacob shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders. Cal gazes at him penetratingly and raises his brows. Jacob looks at him directly and nods, then nods again and turns away. Cal turns and stares directly ahead. Jacob gets off his bar stool, puts his hands in his pockets, and soldiers out. Cal downs his shot. At school, all the kids have dressed smartly and lined up on a long row at the back of tiered seating constructed in the hall. Cal walks past the kids and over to the seating. He looks across the hall and spies Emily with Molly and Hannah. His eyes light up hopefully. He spots an empty seat next to Hannah, then he sees Jacob stamping over a chair to take the seat next to her. Cal looks away. He heads upstairs and makes his way to a seat on the other side of the structure. Cal points to a seat between a man and woman who are chatting. The guy leans back so Cal can sit down. On the stage, Robbie in a suit, sits slumped at the end of a row. Cal eyes him and smiles softly. Robbie looks up and sees Jessica sitting with her parents, then looks down miserably. The principal walks onto the stage and up to the podium. Emily's jaw tightens. Kate takes the podium. Cal beams and claps proudly. Emily, Molly, Hannah and Jacob clap and cheer. Robbie gets up. Jessica smiles. Robbie plods over to the podium. Emily smiles and glances at Molly. Cal frowns. Emily's face falls. Robbie looks at Cal. Cal stands up. The audience all turn to him. Cal makes his way down the seating structure, squeezing past Bernie. Robbie's eyes start to find. Kate leans into the principal. Kate whispers something. The principal nods. Cal faces the audience. Kate puts her middle finger up at him. Cal turns to glance at Robbie. Emily's eyes brim. Tearfully, Emily smiles. Claire and Bernie glance at each other and smile. Emily's jaw slackens. Cal turns back to Robbie. Emily smiles and looks down. Cal turns back to Robbie who beams. Jessica hangs her head, giggling. Emily laughs. Claire glances at Jessica with a worried look. Emily wipes away a tear. Cal puts his arm around Robbie. They leave the podium. In the school grounds, the kids and parents stand around chatting. Emily, Molly, Jacob and Hannah head over to Cal and Robbie. Hannah and Cal wrap their arms around each other. Cal eyes Jacob. Hannah steps back. Cal addresses Jacob. Jacob steps forward nervously. Cal holds out his hand. They shake. Jacob smiles. Cal slaps Jacob.",
    "824": "Cal studies himself in a mirror and picks a shirt. They look through jackets and Cal is measured for a suit. He opens his wallet and tries on a store trilby. In a jeans store, Jacob looks skywards and marches off. Cal hurries after him and Jacob turns back, shrugs, then slaps Cal's cheeks. In a hairdresser's, specifically Cal's hairdresser, he steps out in his new garb. Jacob steps confidently over to Cal. Later, they sit in the bar together and Cal shrugs. Jacob raises his eyebrows. Cal is wearing a sharp blue suit. Jacob and Cal approach a group of women on a couch. Amy looks down awkwardly, then turns away. Jacob points at Cal and she nods. Cal watches Jacob leave with all the different women, including two at the same time. A beautiful dark-haired woman with olive skin heads towards Cal. He can't take his eyes off her. She wears a low-cut black dress and makes a beeline for him. She shakes her silky hair from her face. Cal smiles. She reaches the table and presents Cal with the bill. They've racked up a bill of $837.57. Cal's smile disappears. She presses the button and the page comes out completely black. She screws her eyes shut. A guy spots her and stops. He comes into the room. In a classroom, a teacher writes on the blackboard. In the classroom, Robbie is texting on his mobile. At her locker, Jessica receives the text. Frowning, Jessica shakes her head and texts back. Robbie receives the text, stands, then sits back down as a blonde girl smiles. Emily comes out of the assistant principal's office to Robbie, who is waiting. They traipse out together. Robbie chuckles softly. Emily smiles and puts an arm around his shoulder. In her office, Emily types at her computer. She glances up as Robbie glides past her desk on an office chair. He stops opposite her. She glances at a photo on the shelf, then looks at Robbie. Robbie shrugs. It's a photo of her and Cal. She lays it face down and turns back to Robbie. She frowns, smiles, takes a deep breath and continues typing. She nods somberly, knits her fingers together, and puts her head against her hands. David smiles. Robbie shakes his head disapprovingly. Emily heads off. David swaggers away, then pauses. He turns back and eyes Robbie, who stares back at him impassively. David heads back to Emily's office. He glances around and enters with a grin on his face. David sits. Robbie pulls a lever under his chair. It rises up, so he looks down on David. She frowns at David. David waves. Robbie places the photo of Emily and Cal firmly at the front of his mom's desk and marches out.",
    "826": "David is mowing the grass, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt with a deep V. He grins back at Emily, who licks her lips salaciously. Cal wakes with a jolt and gets up. In Emily's garden, a ball falls from a tree, and Cal falls out of the branches. He remains still and regards the house intently. Cal waters the flower beds, glances back at the house, and prunes one of the rose bushes. He treads over the lawn with shoes with long metal spikes on the bottom, trims the hedge, and treads over the lawn the other way. He sidles across it and a security light comes on. He freezes, then makes a run for it. Cal plays catch with Robbie, both wearing baseball gloves. Robbie nods, and Cal raises his brows, then squints at Robbie. Cal lobs the ball at Robbie, who catches it in his baseball glove and beams. He throws it back. Jessica's parents, ex-friend Bernie, and Claire are there. Cal sits on a chair alone in a corridor, his brow furrowed, and stares ahead. He glances to his right as Emily approaches from the other direction and stands. She smiles shyly, and he beams brightly at her. They both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers and shuffle awkwardly in their seats. They both knit and unknit their fingers. Cal looks down at the floor, nods, looks down, and shakes his head. Emily takes a deep breath. Cal smiles serenely, then his expression becomes serious. Emily's eyes well with tears. Kate forces a grin, yanks the door angrily, closes her eyes, and takes a deep, calming breath. She stands and touches her temple gently. Emily smiles coldly and turns to face Cal. She gawks at him. He raises his brow but looks down. She opens and closes her mouth and nods her head. Cal shakes his head and stares at his feet, sighing. A gentle smile creeps across his face. Tearfully, Emily smiles. A crowd has gathered. Cal turns to Emily sheepishly, and she glares at him. He hangs his head and shakes it, then looks up. His eyes dart around. Emily walks away. Cal turns to watch her go. Emily gets into her car and drives off. Bernie and Claire walk away. It starts to rain. Jacob sits alone in his smart, minimalist apartment, eating a bowl of cereal and studying the packet with a large black and white abstract painting hanging behind him. Emily drives through the night, shaking her head in disbelief. She blinks and sighs heavily. Cal leans against his car outside the school and lets the rain soak him.",
    "827": "The gentle golden glow of a street light shimmers on the rain-slick road as people with umbrellas hurry into a restaurant. Hannah, her boyfriend, other colleagues, and Liz sit around a table in the restaurant. Whilst her colleagues laugh, Liz signals to a waiter. Hannah looks disappointed. Liz gapes over at the couple, her eyes wide, her expression anxious. Hannah eyes her boyfriend searchingly. She steps in close to him. He raises a hand. She grabs a guy's drink and gulps it. She heads off, marching out high-fiving Liz on the way. Hannah strides through the rain. In the bar, Jacob is flirting with a blonde 20-something woman. Frowning, Jacob turns and smiles at Hannah curiously. Rain-drenched, she storms over to him, grabs his face in her hands, and kisses him hard. Slowly, Jacob reaches around her waist. He pulls her to him and lifts her gently off the ground, still locked in a passionate embrace. After some time, Hannah pulls away and looks him straight in the eye. Jacob smiles happily. Hannah nods curtly and kisses him again. Jacob puts her back down. She drags him out of the bar. The woman he was flirting with earlier stares at them incredulously as they leave. Hannah stands in the living room of Jacob's apartment, watching the rain through the tall glass windows. Jacob pours liquor onto a sugar lump in a glass, then crushes the lump with a pestle. He pours in more liquor and some ice cubes. He grates some orange peel into the drink. A stylus lowers onto a record. Jacob goes into the living room carrying two drinks. Hannah stands in her knee-length black dress fidgeting nervously. He hands her the glass. She glugs down her drink at top speed. She cringes. She shakes her head. She grabs the other drink off Jacob and starts gulping that down. She gags. She hands back both empty glasses. Jacob heads over to a coffee table to put them down. Hannah does a nervous twirl. Jacob takes off his jacket and sits down. He squeezes his hands into fists. He points to himself. He nods and smiles. He takes off his top to reveal a tanned, muscular torso with a six-pack. Hannah scrutinizes him. He looks down at himself. She touches him. She gawks at him. He smiles smugly. She limbers up. She runs at him. He lifts her up. Her legs flop. Then she lifts them up. Slowly, he spins around, then stops. She lowers her legs. He lets her fall into his arms so she's pressed up against his body. He lets her slide gently down until her feet touch the floor. He presses his forehead against hers.",
    "828": "Cal hurries into the bar, surveying it and studying the various men and women chatting and flirting with one another. Wet from the rain, he steps further into the bar. Meanwhile, in his bedroom, Jacob leans over Hannah, who lies back on the bed. He kisses her, kisses her again, and leans down to kiss her once more. Still wearing his trousers, he lies between her open legs, then pulls away from her and flops onto the bed. In the garage, Hannah sits in the massage chair, wrapped in a sheet. They lie on the bed laughing; Jacob smiles, licks his lips, and nods. Eventually, Jacob falls asleep with his glass in his hand. Hannah takes the glass, puts it on a chest of drawers, then pulls the sheet up over him. She gazes at him and smiles, propping herself up in bed. She leans over and kisses him on the cheek, then lies back down, resting her head on his shoulder. She nuzzles into him and closes her eyes. Back at the bar, Cal's brow is knitted as he talks on the phone. He sits at the bar drinking on his own while the bartenders are cleaning up. Cal looks over at a balding guy opposite him and of a similar age. The guy sips his drink through a straw and notices Cal eying him, raising his brows in acknowledgment. With a sad expression, Cal picks up his mobile. In a restaurant, Emily's phone rings, but she hangs up. Heading back to her house, David leans in and kisses her. The door opens, and they both nod awkwardly. David glances at Jessica and smiles before heading off. Jessica has her arms folded and grins, then shrugs and shakes her head before striding off. Emily goes in and shuts the door behind her. She has a clutch bag in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the other, which she tosses on a chest of drawers in the hall. Robbie sits on the stairs, watching her, but she passes without noticing him. Someone pedals furiously on a bike; it's Robbie pedaling through the night with the bunch of flowers. At home, in her room, Jessica gets out a camera from her drawer. Studying her reflection in a mirror, she dons mascara, brushes out her long, dark hair, and sweeps eyeshadow across her lids. She applies a peachy-colored lipstick to her lips, presses them together, then pouts in the mirror. She puts the camera on a shelf in her room, and the light on it flashes. She stands a few feet away in her dressing gown.",
    "829": "She turns to face the camera and undoes the ties on her dressing gown. She takes a deep breath and drops the gown to the floor. She does a big, cheesy grin as the camera takes a picture, then frowns and shakes her head. She sets up the camera again and tries a variety of poses, attempting to be sexy. She rips a cute kitten poster off the wall. She prints out one of the photos, puts it in an envelope, and writes Cal's name on the envelope. She stops decorating the envelope. She opens the front door to find a bunch of lilies. Jessica picks up the bunch of flowers and reads the note. She shakes her head and stares out into the night. Cal is doing guerrilla gardening again. Cal puts the tools back in the shed. From in the house, Cal turns towards the house. He watches as Molly and Robbie hurry to the table. Emily traipses through the house to another room. She picks up a phone and dials. In the garden, Cal takes his phone out. Cal eyes Emily nervously. Cal watches Emily, who is not in the basement at all. Emily smiles. Cal's eyes are full of tenderness. Emily hangs up and looks down sadly. Cal hangs up, still watching her from the garden. Emily heads back to the kids. The wheels of a trolley rotate on a shiny floor. Cal is in a DIY store with Robbie and Molly. Cal picks up a wooden trellis. Jacob is in a wine shop. Jacob turns to Hannah. He pinches her nose, then kisses her. They head off. In Jessica's bedroom, her mom, Claire, is putting away clean laundry. As she puts something in her drawer, she spots the envelope. She takes it out to see Cal's name written on it in big letters. She opens the envelope and partially pulls out the photo from inside. She gasps, horrified. Emily drives her SUV along her leafy, suburban street and turns into her driveway. Robbie is standing in the front garden. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. He waves. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. Claire comes down the stairs in a state of shock. Bernie is sitting on the couch, watching TV. Bernie takes a swig of Coca-Cola. Claire grabs Bernie's shoulder from behind the couch and hands him the envelope. Bernie gives Claire a little frown and turns back to the TV. Absentmindedly, he opens the envelope and glances down at the photo. He freezes. There are several photos in there. He goes through them. His jaw goes slack. Jessica, who is lying on the floor nearby, spots the envelope. Bernie races her from the couch to the door.",
    "830": "A black sedan pulls into an empty car park in the early morning light. A couple is at work in a warehouse. He is in the toilet. In Harken's office, Harken pours Nick a big measure of whiskey from a cut-glass decanter and hands it to him. The tumbler is nearly full. Nick frowns, stares, and then starts for the door. Harken watches from behind his desk as Nick picks up the tumbler of whiskey and glugs it all in one go. It spills down his chin as he drains the glass. At the dentist's, bearded Dale is assisting his attractive boss, Julia, with a patient. She uses a spraying device and sprays Dale's crotch. Julia stands up and administers gas. Kurt's boss, Jack, opens his car door and drives away from the chemical company. Kurt spins around and is with Dale. Kurt spots a hot chick. At the premises of Comnidyne, staff are gathered in a meeting room. Nick leafs through documents, puts them down, and winks at a colleague. Nick drags Harken through the office by his tie, smashes him through a window, and he plummets onto the roof of a parked car. Colleagues clap and cheer. Nick snaps to from his reverie and chases after him. Harken stares blankly. Nick glares stony-faced as Harken creases up, turns back, steps closer, and then turns and walks away. Brow furrowed, Nick looks at the floor. Kurt shows up for work at Pellit and Sons. As he takes off his jacket, Jack's son, Bobby, scoots back in his black leather office chair and glowers. He is short with a goatee, a high forehead, and wispy, thin comb-over. He scoots back into the office. Kurt goes through to him. A guy in a wheelchair is present. She is practically nude, wearing nothing but lacy knickers, stockings, and suspenders beneath an open lab coat. She smirks. He sidles nervously to a chair and sits down. She slowly runs her fingers along his beard and then his chest. She clutches his balls and then lets go. He frantically rattles the handle of the locked door and exits. Night, at the bar, Kenny takes the cash they offered and goes. Dale is filling out a form in the dentist's office when he suddenly has his eyes covered. Julia gives smiley blonde Stacy a hug. They turn to a troubled-looking Dale, who forces a smile. Off they go. Stacey is gassed. Julia dives for Dale's crotch. She holds up a tablet computer, revealing compromising photos of Julia faking a variety of sex acts with an unconscious Dale, including doggy style. She winks and leaves the room. Exasperated, Dale's eyes rove in thought. His car screeches to a halt, mounting the curb as he parks outside Nick's place.",
    "831": "He goes inside where Nick and Kurt are playing video games. The next night, a laid-back Nick, clean-shaven with short, dark brown hair, wearing jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up, strolls along a walkway at a Travel Inn. He comes to a room and knocks gently on the door. Dale answers, leaving the security chain fastened. Nick grabbed him. Dale and Kurt run to the window and see a man dressed in black get out of a black muscle car. Kurt and Dale share an excited look and clench their fists. Kurt pauses to compose himself, then opens the door and says something. Kurt points. The sharp-suited man wears dark glasses. He enters the room and takes off his shades. He throws a plastic sheet down. The guys get in Kurt's car and drive into a rough neighborhood. They near a bar and enter it. It's bustling with shady clientele. Kurt nods to a musclebound guy, a Latino, and finally, to the heavyset, black barman. The barman bridles. A guy eyes them as they leave. They follow the guy from inside, a black man with a shaven head and several tattoos. Jones glares at them. Harken smashes his office wall down with a sledgehammer. His extended office now complete, Harken removes a strip of clear plastic from a plaque on the door and buffs it with his sleeve. Nick glowers and withdraws money from his bank account. Balding Bobby Pellitt is partying hard with three Thai hookers in skimpy underwear. He snorts a line of cocaine from one's stomach. They writhe in orgiastic abandonment. Kurt, in the main office, frowns as Bobby's bare torso presses up against the window. At home, Kurt raids a private stash of money. Now in the main office, Bobby looks over at Kurt and gives him the finger as he smooches with one of the women. Kurt frowns. Bobby's shirt is open, exposing his bloated stomach. He holds up Hank's handicapped parking pass. At the dentist, Julia licks the back of Dale's neck, then sucks his left earlobe and jams her tongue in his ear. He furrows his brow as she tweaks his nipples. She grins, then slaps his ass. Wearing a black hoodie and dark glasses, Dale withdraws money from a cash point in a gas station mini-mart. The guys sit opposite Jones at a table in a dingy bar. They push a large briefcase towards him, and he opens it. It's empty, apart from a small bundle of bank notes. He snaps it shut. Jones sips his drink. He beckons them closer, and they lean forward. He reaches inside his jacket.",
    "832": "The guys consider for a moment, and Nick stares down, brow creased, then takes the briefcase. Nick is at work where Harken harangues an employee within earshot of Nick. Nick takes a pen and slides it down his throat, causing himself to vomit into his wastepaper basket, then wipes his mouth and picks up the plastic bin and heads out. The guys drive down a leafy, suburban street and gaze over at a large house. Kurt grins as night falls and they all share a look while chewing on snacks. They get out of the car and quickly hide as Bobby's garage door swings open. An orange Pontiac Trans Am tears out and drives off down the street. Nick and Kurt roll under the slowly closing garage door, but Dale bashes into it, causing the door to open again. In the house, they find tasteless artifacts and a deep tray of cocaine about the size of a CD case, which he drops, creating a cocaine cloud in the air. Kurt enters the bedroom where there's a large Japanese style portrait of Bobby brandishing nunchucks and pockets something from the dresser. Nick, who wears a short sleeved T shirt, watches Dale pick up the tray. Kurt uses his sleeve gloves to turn the light on in Bobby's on-suite bathroom, spots Bobby's toothbrush, takes it from his holder, slides it down his ass crack and has a good scrub, then puts it back. Dale's hoody is dusted with cocaine, and he tries to sweep it off with a Dustbuster vacuum. Kurt picks up Bobby's razor and pops it down the back of his trousers. In the open plan living space, Nick dumps the contents of the Dustbuster into the cocaine tray, which is now full of dust, cocaine and debris, and Nick is stony-faced. Kurt finds dental floss and Dale sniffs and flexes his jaw. Kurt finishes up in the bathroom, turns the light off and leaves. In the living room, Kurt slaps Dale and Dale rolls his shoulders. Street lamps illuminate the darkened street as they drive on and pull up outside Harken's palatial home and park in the shadows. Approaching the front door, they climb over a low hedge and peer in through the windows. Something catches Nick's eye, and he takes a rock from a plant pot by the door, then tosses it to Kurt. Nick takes a key from the rock and they enter the spacious hallway. Hanging in the lounge is a portrait of Harken with his wife and their cat. The cat leaps onto Nick's shoulder and bolts. Dale sings along to the radio in the car. Kurt and Nick start across the landing, where life size cat figurines rest on small podiums. A porcelain cat's face hangs on the wall.",
    "833": "The real cat leaps from a sideboard. There is a photograph. He reorientates the phone screen and throws a food wrapper out of the car window. Harken jogs up in a mismatched designer track suit. Preoccupied with his iPhone, Dale doesn't see him. Harken picks up the wrapper and glowers. Dale spins around. Harken collapses. Dale plunges an EpiPen injection into Harken's chest. Kurt looks out of a bedroom window. They see Dale pounding Harken's chest. Kurt unwittingly drops Bobby's mobile as they hurry out. He drives the long needle into Harken's neck as Kurt and Nick leg it out of the house. A car pulls up. Harken comes to. She kisses Dale. Harken snatches the EpiPen. Nick and Kurt walk together. Dale screeches up in Kurt's Volkswagen. Traffic streams along a highway as night turns to day. The guys stride down a supermarket aisle like they mean business. Nick finds rat poison. He compares two brands, Rat Attack and Rat Out. He opts for the Rat Attack. Kurt tries out some binoculars. He hones in on a tight backside and smiles. Lowering the binoculars, he sees that the ass belongs to a guy holding a yucca plant. Kurt blanches and returns the binoculars to the shelf. Dale happens upon jars of peanuts. There's an offer on, three for one, $2.49. He fills his basket with jars. The guys leave. Dale is laden with three carryout bags of nuts. The guys get in their separate cars. Kurt reverses his white sedan, making way for Dale and Kurt who close in on the same narrow gap and stop. Kurt falters, then drives in front of Nick and circles the two cars to bring up the rear. As Nick drives off to the right, Dale goes to turn left, blocking Kurt who brakes jerkily. The sun sets beyond the city limits and day turns to night. The guys park outside the houses of their assigned bosses. Dale waits outside Harken's. Two Thai sex workers leave Bobby's. One was a man dressed as a woman. Bobby goes back indoors. Kurt spies Julia through binoculars. She goes to the boot of her car. As she bends over to retrieve a bag, Kurt ogles her backside. As sultry Julia heads indoors, Kurt's phone rings. Seeing a light come on in Harken's place, he shuts the player and pays attention. In a walk-in wardrobe, Harken sniffs one of his wife's dresses and roots through her handbag. He walks into the lounge. Harken's gray mackerel striped tabby cat is stretched out under a chair, purring up Bobby's phone. Harken grabs the phone and brings up a profile of its owner, complete with name, photograph and details. Dale ducks down in his car seat as Harken drives past in his SUV.",
    "834": "Nick watches from his car as Bobby jumps around by the window in silk pajamas, flailing a pair of nunchucks. He considers for a moment. Meanwhile, Dale, carrying a jar of peanuts, sneaks through Harken's house. He puts a light on in the bedroom and goes to the door of the on-suite bathroom. He opens it and the cat leaps out at him. He falls against the shower. He picks up a bottle of shampoo. His eyes move between the shampoo and the peanuts. Nick sees Bobby's bedroom lights go out. He heaves a sigh and looks at his box of Rat Attack. He answers his phone. Bobby answers the door to Harken, who hands him his phone and shoots him in the chest. Nick ducks down in his car as Harken flees the scene in his 4X4. He yanks his seatbelt, but it won't budge. Panicking, Dale tidies Harken's shower soaps and legs it with the peanuts. A speed camera snaps a picture of Nick as he hurtles through a red light. The guys meet in a bar. They get in Nick's car. A squad car has blocked them in. A black officer strolls over and taps on Nick's window. The cop peers in. They're in the back of the cop car. At the precinct, Dale, Kurt and the two detectives stare at Nick. He frowns. Kurt's face drops as he recalls scrubbing his backside with Bobby's toothbrush. The guys find Jones drinking in the bar. Jones cocks an eyebrow and shoots them a look. They huddle closer. Jones smirks and sips his drink. The guys ride in Kurt's car. He drives up outside Harken's house. They sneak into Harken's house. Kurt squats by Rhonda. She smiles at him. Harken enters. Harken stomps out of the room. Kurt heads for Rhonda. Nick and Dale. Kurt emerges from the bathroom with Rhonda close behind. In the car, they spot cops. Kurt drives off. Harken rams them in his SUV. He rams them again. They weave around a car. Julia is naked in a bath. Kurt accelerates. Harken rams their back end side-on to spin them around. Julia masturbates. They swerve wildly through traffic. Kurt hangs a sharp left into an empty street. Harken smashes into them in his 4x4. The airbags go off. Harken taps on the window with his revolver. Kurt lowers his window. They get out. He holds them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself. The gun. Harken sinks to the floor and clutches his leg. Dale tosses the gun down. The guys high-five. Harken goes for Kurt, but Nick smacks him hard in the face, knocking him to the ground. Luke smirks. He pats her. She pulls the patient's trousers down.",
    "838": "Diana helps Sandy up and pushes him aside as the car accelerates. She rolls up the windshield and falls to the pavement. Pushing the airbag away, the skiptracer sees a squad car speeding straight at him. As he turns, a car T-bones him. Sandy kneels over Diana, his face tensing. She startles awake and punches him in the throat. Sandy flails backward. Sitting up, Diana sees a squad car speed by, then glances behind them. Squad cars surround the skiptracer. An officer hops out with his pistol drawn. The skiptracer sits back, dazed. They arrest him as Sandy and Diana scurry away unseen. They exit the overpass through a construction gate and down a staircase. Now, in a parking lot, Sandy and Diana stagger toward the Chevy Caprice. He looks off as she enters the car. Now, with St. Louis behind them, Sandy cruises along with a joyful grin as Diana sleeps. Later, the sun rises in a pale orange sky. In broad daylight, Sandy drives through rural farmland. He checks the fuel gauge on a country highway. Sandy keeps his tired eyes on the road. Glancing over, he startles as Diana sleeps with her glazed eyes wide open. Sandy gently closes her eyelids and her head falls into his lap. He yanks her up by the hair and Diana's mouth hangs open. Our view quickly rises into the sky, following the sun through a full day. At sunset, they cruise toward the Denver skyline. At night, Sandy parks the beat-up car outside his apartment and enters with Diana. His daughters run into his arms. Sandy's brow rises at his approaching wife. They share a long, loving kiss as Diana enters, her sheepish eyes averted to the floor. She connects eyes with Trish. The young girls extend their hands. Diana shifts her gaze to Sandy, who flashes a grin. Now, the Pattersons eat dinner with Diana. Trish looks at her husband, who glances at their guest and takes a bite. Sitting across from Diana, Sandy's daughters stare warily at her. Diana smears potatoes on her forehead. Jessie plops food onto her forehead with a fork. Later, Trish dries dishes in the kitchen. Diana timidly walks in and puts her hand on the counter. She removes it and straightens. Diana shifts her weight and steps closer. She outlines her groin and chest. Trish awkwardly blinks at her. Diana starts to go, then turns back. She gazes earnestly at Diana. The redhead leaves the kitchen. Watching her go, Trish clutches a plate and drying cloth. Her gaze wanders to the floor. Now, in bed, Sandy lies on his side. He rolls to his right and sidles up next to his wife, who lightly touches his shoulder.",
    "840": "Sandy looks at his phone before his co-worker enters. Sandy watches the man leave, then later approaches his co-worker in the garage. More co-workers step out and include Sandy in a circle. Wide-eyed, Sandy glances at his co-workers, then looking down, a smile creeps across his face as he considers. He raises his gaze and nods. Meanwhile, Sandy's daughter kicks a soccer ball off a field, and her mother cheers from the sidelines. Sandy approaches his wife, who jumps back with surprise. He speaks to her with his hands gently holding her face. Holding her hand over her mouth, she jumps with joy and gives Sandy a hug. He smiles and lifts her off her feet. Elsewhere, a plump identity thief sips from a straw as she rides down an escalator. At a store, she tries on a ring, then moves to cosmetics. Two women laugh as they watch the cosmetics girl apply makeup to the redhead. At a cell phone kiosk, the man smiles. At the center of the mall, a mother and daughter sit on a jet ski. The redhead buys it. At a Brookstone, she sleeps on a massage chair with her open mouth drooling. An employee approaches and pokes her. She sorts through a stack of Sandy's cards. Later, Sandy and his daughters brush their teeth. In his car, Sandy smiles and bobs his head as he taps his thumbs on the steering wheel. He glances down at the dashboard, where the low-gas light blinks on. His smile fades. He pulls into a gas station. At the pump, Sandy puts in his credit card. Holding the card to his mouth, he breathes on the strip, then wipes the card on his jacket. Sandy pushes the card in again. Inside, the attendant stands behind a clear protective glass, talking on an earpiece. The attendant swipes the card, talks into his earpiece, points to his earpiece, then slides Sandy the cut card. Now, in Sandy's car, a police car pulls up behind him. Officers emerge from the cruiser. Sandy peeks out the window as one of the officers approaches. The other officer stands back with his hand by his sidearm. The detective touches his phone, then returns with a file. He hands Sandy the thief's haggard mug shot, then leaves Sandy shaking his head. Later, the family man parks a Subaru and enters a modern office, passing a company logo. He goes to a glass door and pushes it open. He admires his new office as his former coworker, now new boss, approaches. Four cops stand at reception. As men put lids on boxes, the lead detective approaches Sandy and his boss. Sandy faces his boss, who turns to the detective.",
    "843": "He casually pours out the Barbicide disinfectant from a glass container and drops it on the floor. He flips open a Zippo lighter and strikes it on his leg. Her mouth hangs open as she points to the desk. At night, in Sandy's car, smiling Diana applies makeup while he faces forward with a stern gaze, shaking his head. Now, as they enter a restaurant, a young red-haired waitress greets them. The smiling waitress walks away, but he signals her, making her turn. The shocked waitress eyes Sandy, glares at him, and leaves. He looks upward as the waitress returns with a mound of food. She pulls her thumb from Sandy's soup and as the waitress leaves, Diana takes a large bite of ribs. Now, in a motel, they approach the front desk and she leaves. Diana enters The Foxhole and a husky bearded man in a cowboy hat notices her. He nods to himself as Diana sips her green beverage, then turns away. Looking up, she notices his Mercedes car key and thick gold ring on his pinky. The man smiles, sits beside her, and removing his hat, extends a hand. He wears a turquoise bolo. They toast and down their shots. Now, they sit at a table with several empty shot glasses and as they drink another shot, Diana slaps the table. Sandy enters, scans the room, and smiling, approaches their table. She points at Chuck, places a hand on his shoulder, and Big Chuck nods. She leads Chuck to the dance floor where Diana and Big Chuck shimmy. With her eyes on Sandy, Diana pinches Chuck's nipples through his shirt. Spinning around, Diana bends over and Big Chuck twirls his cowboy hat behind her like riding a bronco. She stands and they continue dancing with her eyes on Sandy, who motions toward the door. Facing Chuck, Diana shimmies in place, then suddenly drops into a split with her face by his crotch. Big Chuck points finger guns at Sandy, as Diana dances on the floor. Now, they enter a motel room and Sandy sets down his wallet. Chuck walks into Diana's arms and Big Chuck whips off his belt, swinging it up from his crotch like an elephant's trunk, hitting Sandy in the face. Chuck gives him a final belt slap, then drops it. He aims a finger gun at his crotch and unbuttons his pants, then drops his pants. She spanks Big Chuck as he rapidly knocks his knees. Diana swipes the anxiety pills. Stumbling back, Chuck pulls up his pants. Big Chuck grabs her hips from behind and they fall backwards onto the bed. Big Chuck spreads his legs in the air, then sits up. Diana drops a pill into his cup, then pours two drinks as he twitches drunkenly.",
    "844": "She empties out a mini bottle and bites the top off another. Shaking his cup, she turns with a playful smile and sashays back and forth. Diana's smile quickly fades and she sets down the drinks. Diana blinks her moist eyes. He points to her blue gingham blouse. Big Chuck tenses his face and nods. Diana glances off with a sweet smile, as Chuck slowly removes his cowboy hat. He gazes into her eyes. She leaps on him. Sandy listens from the bathroom and rubs his face. Diana grips the bed as Chuck thrusts behind her. Sandy covers his ears. Falls onto her back. Sandy turns on the shower. Sandy ties a towel around his ears as Diana yanks on Chuck's neck with his belt. Now, she holds his legs from behind and bounces rapidly. Sandy buries his head in his hands. Lying on the floor, Sandy kicks the wall. Diana spots Big Chuck's wallet and car keys on a small table and her smile fades. She finishes buttoning her shirt and glances back at the sleeping man. She notices Sandy's wallet and phone by the room key on the dresser. Stepping forward, she collects Sandy's things and grabs Big Chuck's belt off the floor. The plump criminal shifts in place. Sandy's eyes shoot open and he pulls the towel off his head. Outside, she staggers away. Sandy yanks on the bathroom door handle. On the other side, Big Chuck's belt holds it closed. She crosses the quiet motel parking lot with a backpack in hand. Diana slings the bag over her shoulder and it slides off as she arrives at Sandy's car. Sliding into the driver's seat, Diana tosses the bag into the next seat and places Sandy's phone in the center console. She leans forward and inserts the key into the ignition. Sitting back, Diana pulls a small amount of cash from Sandy's wallet and sifts through the bills. Grabbing Sandy's cell phone, she admires the photo of his smiling daughters. Diana holds the phone to her ear. Tensing her face, Diana fights back tears. The thief covers her eyes, then shifts her pained gaze around. Diana closes her eyes and places both hands on the wheel. Removing one, she rubs her forehead. Now, she enters the motel room and puts Sandy's belongings back on the dresser. Sandy crashes through the bathroom door. He quickly kneels. She moves across the room with the ice bucket and sets it on the bedside table. Taking off the backpack, Diana lies down next to Big Chuck. She takes all the blankets, revealing his naked rear end. Sandy stands up and eyes the room. The next morning, Sandy waits by the car as Diana approaches with sunglasses and disheveled hair.",
    "845": "At the front desk, the attendant hands Sandy a clipboard. Outside, Diana opens the car door. As Sandy pours himself a cup of coffee, the brown utility van pulls into the motel parking lot. The skiptracer walks around and sees Diana sitting in the open passenger side. Inside, Sandy stirs his coffee while the skiptracer pulls Diana from the car. He notices the abduction through the window. Sandy runs outside as the skiptracer pushes Diana into the van. The skiptracer locks the door and hurries to the wheel. Sandy runs over. Sandy watches the van speed off. He quickly shuts the passenger-side door and gets behind the wheel of his rental. Sandy backs out of his parking spot and speeds away from the motel. On a narrow country road, the skiptracer talks on his cell phone. Sandy comes up on the van. He moves into the oncoming lane and pulls up beside the van. Diana opens a window. Spotting an oncoming car, Sandy hits the brakes and swerves behind the van. Diana pushes against the gated partition. Sandy pulls up beside the van again. The van speeds toward an intersection's red light. Cars whiz by as the van turns sharply. Sandy follows, barely dodging the oncoming vehicles. His sedan skids up alongside another car and he peels away. A two lane highway. Sandy speeds up beside the skiptracer's van. He swerves at Sandy, sending him into a grassy median. Sandy recovers on the other side, facing oncoming traffic. Speeding cars swerve out of his way. Guardrails lie on both sides of the road trapping Sandy with the oncoming traffic. The skiptracer peers out of his window, watching the businessmen at their numerous vehicles. An 18-wheeler speeds towards Sandy and he swerves toward the median. The sedan launches off a mound of dirt and soars through the air. It lands on its tires in the grass and Sandy rejoins the van on the right side of the road. In the van, Diana pounds a cylinder against the partition lock and breaks through. The skiptracer elbows her stomach and holds her back. Diana punches him in the throat and he falls limply against the steering wheel. Sandy slows down and lightly hits the back panel of the van, barely nudging it. Diana notices a merge up ahead. Sandy eyes the runaway van. Gripping the steering wheel, he takes a breath. He speeds into the side of the van causing it to flip over. Sandy stares wide-eyed as the van continues to flip into the median. He stops the car and watches the van land right side up. Sandy unbuckles his seatbelt and slowly emerges from the car. In slow motion, He hurries toward the van with his mouth dropped open.",
    "847": "Sandy reaches into his pockets and comes up empty. He looks at Diana, then walks back to the bench and sighs, shaking his head. Diana looks away somberly as Sandy gazes down at his pants. He sits beside her, kicks off his shoes, and looks down. He pulls out a wad of cash. At the salvage yard, they pull out of the lot in an old, run-down Chevy Caprice. At the bus station, the skiptracer limps in and takes a sip from the juice pouch. Tossing it on the ground, he walks over to the ticket booth. The attendant recoils from the skiptracer's bloody face. He looks around the empty station, then sees the attendant with the hand out. The skiptracer twists his wrist, writes it down, and hands the skiptracer a slip of paper. The skiptracer holds his gun up to the window. As he backs away, a bullet rips through his neck and shatters the glass. Paolo's thugs approach with silenced pistols. The skiptracer holds his neck wound as Julian takes the address. Maricol looks at the attendant and holds her finger up to her lips. The booth window falls apart. Now, Sandy and Diana cruise down the highway toward a bridge. In the car, Sandy's hardened gaze fixes ahead as Diana sits on her side facing him. He swerves the car, smashing her head on the window. He swerves again. Later, they cruise over the Mississippi River into St. Louis. The Gateway Arch stands tall over the city. At a gas station, Sandy fills up as Diana emerges from the car. Sandy looks up thoughtfully. Diana falls in the lobby. The security guard hurries over. As he rubs Diana's leg, a businessman enters the executive fitness center. Sandy glances around, then slips inside the closing door. Sandy watches the man place his suit in a locker as the guard rubs Diana's butt. The businessman closes his locker with the code and leaves. Sandy quickly approaches, puts in a code, and opens the locker. He glances back with a smile. Now, in a dapper suit and red tie, he strolls through the offices with Diana. They spot a balding man behind a desk. Diana and Sandy exchange a look. She faces the man, shielding her mouth with her hand. He lifts his phone. Diana backs away. He stares into Ken's eyes with his brow raised. On a security monitor, Sandy enters the code. Our view lowers inside the records room as a glass door and metal gate slide open. Sandy and Diana briskly enter. Pulling equipment from her bag, Diana hard-lines her credit card burner into the network as Sandy searches the shelves. He finds Cornish's records in a box.",
    "848": "Dark clouds cover half of the bright moon as a figure hurtles dying towards the ground. Long, bony fingers caress the street as the black-tied figure rises to its feet. The figure is a slight man in his 30's with blood streaking the right side of his face. He has blond cropped hair and a thick collar. He stares at lights in the sky which go out and rain falls. He throws himself against the wall and huddles beside it, holding out a broad-bladed dagger and pointing it in the direction of the dog which barks from behind the wire fence. The man rips open his black top, revealing a thin, toned body with tattoos and blood in line with the streak on his face. He walks towards the dog in its pound, raises the dagger above his head and brings it down with great force. Bright light shines on him and a blue light ring falls over his and opens the collar around his neck, which falls to the ground. Rain washes blood across the ground and into a drain. Inside the building, a man in a suit and carrying a torch walks along between stacking shelves, some covered with cellophane. Under a skylight, he steps on a toy and bends down to pick it up. The man in the black coat jumps through the skylight onto him, knocking him and his torch to the floor. The man from the sky goes to a grubby men's room, removes his coat and opens a first aid box. He uses a thread and a bent needle to stitch a nasty wound on his back where flesh has been torn away at shoulder level. He watches his reflection in a mirror as he sews, his bloody hand grasping the sink as his blood drips on the floor. Now dressed, he marches to a door and removes a chain, switching on lights in an armory. Dressed in black, shirt, trousers and light coat, he picks up two assault rifles with grenade launchers, then a selection of assault and sniper rifles. He walks out of the armory with two bags in his hands and reaches a door with a metal bar across it. Two cops, Burton and Estevez, drive along a downtown street. The burlier of the two, Burton, glances out as they pass people on the sidewalk, holding up his fingers in the shape of a gun. A door explodes just in front of them and a man is hurled into the air. A hole in the shape of a cross has been made in the building and they watch as the man from the sky steps into the flaming surround. Burton gets out and draws his gun.",
    "849": "The possessed clamber and crawl over the van, scratching the windscreen with their fingernails. Charlie picks up a machine pistol but Michael stops her, taking the machine pistol and picking up an assault rifle instead. Bob and Jeep pull the planks away from the door and open it, allowing Michael to walk out, guns blazing. Possessed drop dead as a couple runs at Michael, but he batters them away, pulling out two pistols to shoot some more. He gives another one a kick, shoots him, and lays into a couple more by the van. Michael then takes a nozzle from a fuel pump, sprays gas over the back of the van, and lights it, causing the possessed to flee as the van is engulfed in flames. Inside, Audrey cowers fearfully, moving over to the passenger seat as Michael smashes the driver's window, grabs her hand, yanks her out, and they run off just before the van blows up, throwing them into the diner. Charlie fills a jug with water and turns to see the boy, dropping the jug as he slashes the front of her shirt with a big kitchen knife. Charlie recoils and holds up a metal tray as the boy stabs at her, the knife sticking in the tray. His hands slide down the blade, and the knife drops to the floor. The boy stares at his bloody hands as Charlie lowers the tray and kicks him over. Michael clambers in front of Charlie and aims his gun, but the boy's disappeared. The lights go out, plunging the place into darkness. Michael runs over to where the boy was as Bob and Jeep come over, shining a torch on the ground, revealing a trail of blood. Jeep aims his torch beam up, following a trail of bloody hand prints across the ceiling that stops dead. The boy appears behind Bob and tries to throttle him, but Michael grabs the boy and hurls him away, allowing Jeep to shoot him. Charlie bends forward, grimacing, as Michael stares at her, holding Charlie's hands while Audrey watches them both. Bob steps out onto the roof to join Jeep as Michael keeps holding Charlie, her mouth gaping. The building shakes. Up on the roof, Bob and Jeep stare out into the darkness as bright light flashes all around, illuminating hundreds of possessed standing motionless, staring at the diner. Charlie's mouth gapes again. Audrey gently lifts the baby, smiling incredulously, and wraps the bloody child in a towel, offering it to Charlie. A tear rolls down Charlie's cheek as she faces away from the child. Audrey carries the baby over to Sandra, who stares at it, frowning, but then smiles and nods, twisting her hands within the ropes bound around them behind her back. Audrey and Michael look at each other, and he shakes his head. Sitting behind Charlie, Michael leans towards her with a sincere expression.",
    "85": "John turns his back to look out the window beside the bureau, then throws a hairbrush that strikes Preacher's head. He becomes certain that Pearl knows. As Preacher's hand locks the door, Willa enters the room in outdoor clothes, not dressed for work in the parlor. She stops and smiles benignly, keeping her smile as she shakes her head in disbelief and moves towards the house while Pearl screams. In a narrow screen with the same setup as an earlier corridor scene, Preacher and Willa's eyes meet. He turns as Willa remains calm and immobile, wearing the ecstasy of a martyr. Preacher hits her across the mouth, then moves towards a coat on the back of a chair, retrieving a knife from the pocket, the same one from the wedding-night scene. He pulls down the blind and moves towards the bed. An insert shot shows Preacher's hand and knife clicking open as he raises his arm to strike. Later, he is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch when he looks up and moves towards her. Walt enters the shot with a pipe, and they both enter the kitchen. Walt clucks his tongue and moves towards the kitchen cabinet, pouring something and snapping it down in weak defiance. He looks off-screen, then sits at a table, mumbling over his Bible. He closes the Bible and turns to them with weepy eyes and a brave little smile. Icey smiles sideways, happy to let her mouth fall open and gasp. The camera pans with slowly streaming weeds, bringing Willa into close profile, her long hair drifting across her throat. A line descends, catching on the windshield and tautening, then tugs. The camera follows the line up, revealing the stern of Ben Harper's skiff. He sits back, tugging at the line, then leans over to see what's wrong. The camera starts moving before he does, tilted to frame him from the waist downward, following close behind him. As he leaves the tree and walks along the side of the house, the camera tilts downward and closes in, following only his feet. He steps past a tiny cellar window, and the camera pans and tightens in close on it. Their noses are flat against the glass, cheeks touching, but the window isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads, and their chins are not visible.",
    "851": "They deflect off Gabriel's steel breastplate. Gabriel rises into the air and swings his mace, crashing it into furniture. Michael wallops. Gabriel leaps over his wing and gets swept with a machine pistol. Gabriel shoves the spike in the middle of his mace into the barrel of the gun. Michael shots and is blown back against the wall. Gabriel attacks and slams the mace against the wall. Michael clutches the shaft of the mace. Gabriel sets the spiked end spinning and pushes it towards Michael's face. Michael shoves it away and Gabriel punches him. Michael punches Gabriel, grabs the overhead TV, and hurls it at Gabriel. Gabriel punches Michael to the floor, grabs him by the throat, lifts him up, and punches him. Michael wallops him back and twists his arm, flings Gabriel over, and kicks him in the face. Gabriel forces Michael over a worktop and pins him down, wielding a hammer. Michael dodges the blow. Gabriel spins and slashes Michael across the chest. Michael looks down at his ripped shirt. Gabriel punches him in face, lunges with the mace, but Michael blocks the blow and the mace flies out of Gabriel's hands. Michael punches and kicks Gabriel, gets on Gabriel's back with his arms around his neck. Gabriel flies upwards and batters Michael against the ceiling. Michael keeps his arms held tight around Gabriel's neck. Gabriel reaches down and picks up the mace, holds it to his side and twists it. A blade shoots out, stabbing Michael behind him. Michael flops back onto the floor, his mouth wide open, lies with his arms outstretched, eyes wide open, twitching slightly, with a bloody wound in his chest. Gabriel turns and stares down at Michael. Tears glisten in Gabriel's eyes. Michael's bloody lips twitch and his eyes close as he expires. A golden light spreads over him. A tear runs down Gabriel's cheek as he watches. The bright light engulfs Michael, then vanishes taking him with it. Gabriel turns to go. As Jeep drives through the light, Charlie turns and looks at him. Black lines and symbols spread up his arm. Gabriel slowly steps through the wrecked diner holding his mace, goes behind the counter where Bob is laying amongst the wreckage. Bob holds his lighter out to a gas tap at the base of an oven, looks up at Gabriel, and sparks up a flame, igniting the gas. Gabriel takes flight as flames engulf the diner and the possessed outside. Jeep drives along a desert highway. Charlie sits on the passenger seat, cradling her baby and smiling down at him. Jeep frowns at Charlie. Then they both look ahead.",
    "854": "He saunters up to her. She takes another drag on her cigarette. Charlie grins, reaches in her overall pocket, and takes out a pack. She holds it out and he takes one. He points at his map. Jeep sees them. Jeep, holding an old wooden cot, stares at them, then walks away. Charlie puffs on her cigarette. In the diner, Audrey sits alone. Sandra squeezes cream into Howard's cupped hand. He rubs it in. Charlie leads a tall, black, 30'ish Kyle inside. Audrey looks up with interest. He glances at the other three diners, then follows Charlie to the counter, all eyes on him. The scruffy, unshaven Bob tilts his head to one side. In the garage, Jeep is cleaning the cot. Bob strides over and sees the old cot on a bench. Bob stares at his son. They're outside. Jeep glares at his father, who shakes his head. Jeep looks down and away from Bob. He glances at his father, who screws up his eyes. Jeep lowers his eyes. Bob pats him affectionately on the cheek. Jeep watches his father go. As Bob enters the diner, Howard turns to him. Bob holds his thumb and forefinger close together. He sees static on the television screen. Outside, Jeep's attention is drawn to something down the road. He steps forward and glances at the horizon. An anomalous-growing dark cloud fills it. Inside, Bob steps up on a chair to examine the TV set. Jeep looks in the opposite direction. Encroaching black cloud dominates the horizon there. Others look at the screen. Kyle proffers money. Percy switches on a radio. He tries tuning it in. Charlie's eyes venture to the TV. Sandra gets to her feet. All six of them are still as they stare at the TV, four standing, Audrey and Howard sitting. Kyle is on the phone in the back. Kyle removes his hat. Bob had switched off the television. In the garage, Jeep is looking at the apparently pristine top of the Beamer's engine block and it's air intake. He looks at it hopelessly. An old white Ford Sedan turns off the road and heads towards the petrol pumps. It passes them and draws to a halt outside the diner. The driver's door opens. The wheels and stanchions of a Zimmer frame are plunked on the rocky ground. An elderly woman with white hair and a pink cardigan emerges from the car. Walks a little. Then shuts the door. Jeep looks curiously around. The old woman's shadow is cast on the diner door. She opens the door and shuffles in with the aid of the Zimmer. Kyle and Percy glance around. Charlie spots her. Audrey glances up at the old woman who grins and looks over at Howard and Sandra.",
    "856": "The car, coming from the opposite direction from where the swarm of flies came, screeches off the road towards the diner. Charlie sees it from a window and runs outside, while the others watch as the car stops. Jeep spots Charlie as the door opens and Michael steps out, seeing Charlie, clutching her belly, run towards him. Jeep runs over beside her. Charlie slows down as Michael stares at her, opening his mouth while keeping his teeth clenched. Bob keeps the pump-action aimed at him, then sees the body. Michael tilts his head to one side and snatches the pump-action. Kyle points his pistol as the shotgun is placed at Bob's forehead. Bob closes his eyes tightly, then screws up his face. Percy comes outside. Michael keeps the shotgun in place, then takes his left hand off the barrel, his right holding the shotgun in position. He turns and looks away. Bob opens his eyes. Michael hands him the gun, then goes to the boot of the squad car, opening it and taking out assault rifles. He hands them to Kyle, Bob, and Jeep, then rushes past Jeep and Bob, heading straight for Charlie. He hands her a pistol. Charlie turns and watches him stride towards the diner. Audrey and Sandra come out as the wind rises, blowing dust before it. Bob stares at the length of the road before moving. Jeep keeps his eyes on the road, then runs to the diner. Inside, they barricade the doors. Jeep pushes the office desk against the back door. Kyle looks out through slathered blinds. Behind him, Michael picks up an assault rifle and stands beside Jeep, who glances nervously at him. The lights go out. A torchlight beam illuminates the diner. Bob shines one at Michael. Michael looks up at the ceiling. Bob leads the way up through a skylight, clambering up the roof to a metal ladder and stepping onto a metal walkway in front of the diner's unlit neon sign. Percy, Kyle, and Michael are with him. They see a light in the distance. It is an ice cream van. Kyle and Bob turn to Percy. He steadies the rifle with his claw-like metallic hand. As the van approaches, down in the diner, Audrey peeps out through the blinds. Jeep is also in the diner with a big torch. The van pulls into the forecourt. The Frosty Treats van pulls up. Audrey joins her mom on the floor, beside Howard. Charlie ducks down behind the counter, the pistol Michael gave her in her hand. Jeep is close by. The others on the roof watch as the driver gets out. Two long, bony hands cling on to the door frame as the ice cream man with a blue forage cap emerges.",
    "858": "On the roof, Kyle watches as the intruders slope off and trudge away from the diner. Michael clutches Sandra, who sinks to her knees, while Jeep helps Charlie up. She looks apprehensive as Michael approaches. Kyle leads in the others from the roof. Audrey tries to console her mother. Bob grimly strides forward. Michael stares at the others, then turns to Charlie. Her smile fades when she sees his somber face and steadfast gaze. Charlie closes her eyes. He loads an assault rifle, turns, and walks away from them. Outside, intermittent bright flashes illuminate the horizon. Kyle is on the roof with Percy. Kyle glances down at Percy, who is crouched low, leaning against a ledge. Percy looks around at Kyle, then turns away and leans a rifle over his arm. Kyle looks awkward. Percy watches as Kyle places the gun on the ledge. Kyle shakes his head. Percy blinks and glances down. Tears fall from his eyes. Kyle raises his head, then turns to stare at Percy beside him. Downstairs, Bob turned on the grill, then lights a cigarette with his lighter. He takes a deep drag, then breathes it out. He picks up a can and drinks from it. He looks across the room at Sandra, whose hair, which had been pulled tight, is now loose. He sets a beer down in front of her. Having wiped the top of the can, she gazes at it, then drinks. She sets it down on the table. Sandra buries her head in her hands. In the storeroom, Jeep looks at Michael curiously. Jeep takes a claw hammer off a hook. Michael hangs his head, then walks over to Jeep. Jeep stares frowning at Michael, who wears a benign expression. Michael leaves a thoughtful-looking Jeep. Bob stands on the roof, leaning against the wall. He drinks beer from a can and puffs on a cigarette. Wind whips through his hair. The sky is filled with dense, gray clouds. He flinches at the sound and looks out at a bank of gray mist. Michael stands on the roof, looking pensive. Michael stands on a roof, silhouetted against bright sunlight. He has wings and is with an elder angel, Gabriel. An army of angels flies overhead. Michael slowly steps across the roof of the diner. The two children swings are blown back and forth by the wind. The strings of light bulbs shake. He drops his beer can. As gray mist rolls in, Bob is sitting by the wall dozing. Sandra is lying on the floor next to Audrey. She wakes and looks around anxiously. She sits up. Hearing the voice, she looks around. She slowly walks through the diner with her arms held stiffly away from her sides.",
    "859": "She goes behind the counter, then into a gloomy corridor where she stops and looks at a door which is slightly ajar. She steps towards the door which has light peeping through the gap and reaches out, pushes the door wide open, and enters the office. Shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk, bathing Sandra's face in the golden light. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out of a window. Outside, Howard is bound to an inverted cross with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin. The blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb. As Sandra climbs down off the chair, Kyle runs in and grabs her around the waist, but Sandra elbows Kyle aside. Audrey wakes up and runs to the office as Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door and pushes Audrey away before running outside where Percy grabs her. Howard's blisters throb and pulsate, then his stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid. Percy heaves Sandra into the office, and she flops on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway, who stares blankly into space then falls flat on his face with his back having been burnt off and steam wafting around his exposed organs. In the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet and Bob leans on the covered corpse, wearing a wretched expression, with Jeep standing in the doorway, and Bob's face twitching. In the diner, Sandra sits bound to a chair with her wrists tied behind her back. Bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed up against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot. Her face wet with tears, Sandra nods. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth and offers her a drink through a straw, then smiles. Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes her with a cold, bitter stare. Kyle walks in, and shaken, Audrey gets up and follows Kyle. Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, turning the dial and moving the aerial around. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her belly. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette and has a puff. By the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, she regards her pretty face in the mirror for a moment with her expression being fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply, stamps on the cigarette, grabs her jacket, and walks out. She sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up, then looks up and smiles at Jeep, taking her feet off the chair.",
    "86": "After looking towards the departed PREACHER, JOHN takes charge, speaking quietly yet calmly and cheerfully. He helps PEARL down a rustling coal-heap, reaching the cellar floor. Meanwhile, PREACHER looks under the bed. As PREACHER'S footsteps descend the stairs, JOHN leads PEARL past a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop, and they crouch beside an apple barrel. PREACHER'S footsteps cross the kitchen, and both JOHN and PEARL look sharply towards the cellar door. The door opens, revealing PREACHER'S head with a candle, illuminating a white-washed wall and stairs. He descends nearly to the bottom of the stairs, but ICEY'S voice interrupts him cheerfully. ICEY appears at the head of the stairs, her voice crackling with authority. After a short pause, the children, covered in coal-dust, emerge into the light and climb the stairs, JOHN'S head hung in defeat. As they enter the kitchen, JOHN looks to PEARL while PREACHER'S hand moves through her hair. PREACHER and ICEY then move towards the door, with PREACHER watching ICEY leave along a path outside. Wondering what to do next, the scene shifts to BIRDIE, drunk and rocking, with a bottle beside a picture. He speaks to the picture, gripping the edge of the chest it's on. Picking up the bottle, his hand trembles, and the bottle falls, spilling liquor. Meanwhile, PREACHER sits at the head of a table loaded with food, dabbing his mouth with a napkin. JOHN stands expressionless while PEARL frowns, remembering PREACHER twisted her arm. PREACHER slaps the table, his eyes crackling, making PEARL start to snivel. He brings out a knife, touching the spring to flick open the blade, and lays it on the table. PEARL, thinking it's a toy, crosses behind JOHN to pick it up, her mouth quivering with a large tear in her eyes as she sniffles and wipes her eyes with her free fist.",
    "869": "Thenardier is down in the sewer and takes Marius' gold signet ring, putting it on. Valjean grabs Thenardier and shoves him down into the sludge. Valjean gets up and hauls Marius up onto his shoulder. With the unconscious Marius over his shoulder, Valjean wades up through the knee-deep sewerage, dim light filtering through gratings above washing over the curved brick work. The sewerage gets deeper, and Valjean is up to his neck. He holds Marius up next to him and shoves a gate open, dragging Marius through an outflow pipe into the dark night. He looks up and sees Javert standing there waiting for him. Covered in sewerage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and climbs up steps out of the sewer. Javert aims a pistol at him, and Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the pistol steady. Valjean considers, then turns and walks away. Wearing a troubled frown, Javert stares at the pistol for a moment, then drops it into the sewer and starts to walk away. Javert stands at the edge of a steep drop into a massive swirling sluice and paces at the edge of the sheer drop. Way down below the water surges and churns with white foam and yellow filth. Javert leans forward and drops into the abyss, washing away into the swirling foam. Marius wakes in a clean bed beneath a ceiling painted with cherubs and angels, nearby is a child's rocking horse, and his grandfather sits beside. Outside the women clean blood from the battle off the troubles. Marius sits alone in a room, scarred by battle, his left arm in a sling, and stares into space thoughtfully. Tears fall from his eyes, and he stands and looks around, his brow arched and his face wracked with anguish. Cosette sits watching him and reaches out to him. He limps over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion, and his grandfather watches. Cosette and Marius kiss. Marius with Valjean takes a seat in the spartan room. Valjean struggles for words, hangs his head, and bows. Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a limp, takes his leave. Valjean carries a large trunk out to a waiting carriage and grimaces in pain. Marius is with Cosette, and on the journey, he leans back in the carriage. It's Cosette's wedding day. Thenardier and his wife hitch a ride on the back of a carriage which arrives at the mansion, sneak round to the far side of the carriage, climb inside, and exit through the opposite door as if they'd arrived in the carriage. Dressed finely, they mingle with the guests, stealing as they go.",
    "872": "He pretends to spoon more of the sauce, and Kate opens her mouth ready to taste it. Nick draws the spoon away a couple of times and watches her full lips open and close. Then, he leans over and plants a kiss to one side of her mouth. The couple move apart slightly and Kate pulls off her blindfold. She moves back in towards Nick. Nick's face edges towards Kate's, and this time he kisses her fully on the lips. The couple begin to kiss more urgently. Kate brings her hands up to cup Nick's face and she stands. Her eyes are closed and her face is relaxed into a serene ecstasy, as Nick kisses her neck then returns to her lips. Finally, Kate falls into Nick's embrace. Next morning, Nick strides down the hallway rattling a spoon in a saucepan. In Zoe's room. Zoe, Kate and Nick are piled into a photo booth. Outside, Kate screams with glee at the pictures. The trio walk down a cold, sunny New York street. Nick has Zoe on his shoulders. All three wear coats, scarves and woolly hats. They dart across a busy street to a Chinese vegetable shop. They leave the shop. All three wear cycling helmets as they pedal a bicycle made for three. The sun sets against the Manhattan skyline as they pedal alongside the river. Nick sits up front. Later in the evening, they come across a street artist copying a fantastical picture of a ballerina onto the pavement in colored chalk. Nick and Kate hold hands. Zoe beams up at them as she admires the drawing. The staff are gathered at the restaurant to review the menu. In the kitchen, Nick completes a vegetable garnish on a dish and lays it out for a waiter. Kate eyes him with suspicion. Paula strolls in from the dining room. Nick is wide-eyed with surprise as he watches Kate stride off to the walk-in fridge. He joins her. The couple stare at each other. From the kitchen, they're framed in the window of the fridge door. Kate is left thoughtful. She returns to her apartment, where a woman in her 60s waits on the sofa. Kate locks the apartment door, turns out the hall lights and saunters back into the room. Passing a side table, she presses a button on the answer phone then lifts a remote and turns off the music. Kate stares thoughtfully. She heads towards her bedroom. Zoe cuddles up to her furry kangaroo. Kate goes into her room. Zoe rolls onto her side. At the restaurant, Paula tackles Kate as she prepares dishes. Kate interviews a series of applicants. At the apartment, Zoe watches TV as Kate works at her desk.",
    "873": "Zoe returns to watching the black-and-white gangster movie on the TV, her eyes darting around as she thinks. Suddenly, she rises resolutely from the sofa, strides out of the open-plan lounge and down the hallway, past the double doors opening onto Kate's desk, ignoring Kate who remains at her desk. In her room, Zoe sits on her bed with a scarlet-haired smiling rag doll resting on her drawn up knees, pulling up the doll's striped skirt and red polka dot top. She considers the words with downcast eyes, then replaces the doll's clothing and stares into the doll's face. Meanwhile, wearing a white dressing gown and with damp hair, Kate strides down the hallway and is next seen outside Zoe's school. They drive around in Nick's blue pickup truck, Kate holding her hand to her mouth and running her hand through her hair. Later, Kate moves around to the side of Zoe's bed and catches sight of the cuddly toys on her pillow, considering them briefly before picking up the furry kangaroo. They drive past leafless trees into the bleak, deserted cemetery. Zoe returns the hug that Kate has given her. Both crying, Kate kisses Zoe's cheek and gently wipes away her tears. The pair separate and Zoe mouths an acknowledgment, then turns to pick up her red rucksack. They stand and Kate brushes off her long, black coat, taking Zoe's hand as they walk away from the grave towards Nick, who's been watching from a distance. Amid the faded flowers on the grave is Zoe's peacock feather, fluttering in the breeze. Nick drives Zoe and Kate home and as he pulls up, Zoe turns to him. Kate and Zoe climb out of the truck, Kate hands her the keys and Nick offers his hand, which Kate takes. Her eyes fix longingly on him and Nick squeezes her hand, but she pulls away, closing the door and looking at Nick through the window. Kate stands alone in the sunlit street as a truck drives away. Later, in the busy restaurant kitchen, Bernadette reenters the kitchen. Brandishing an uncooked steak held high on a carving fork, Kate marches out of the kitchen through the dining room and up to table seven, tearing off her apron, thrusting it at a waiter, and striding out. Paula stares blankly as Kate hails a cab and gets in. On her therapist's roof terrace overlooking Manhattan, Kate turns and eyes the man with realization. In a shabby elevator, Kate clutches a copper saucepan wrapped in a tea towel, stepping out onto a landing lined with a discarded metal trolley and window grill. She hesitates, then knocks. Without taking his eyes off Kate, Nick steps back from the door, revealing an open-plan loft apartment beyond.",
    "875": "She unpacks a rabbit. A plate of vegetables and a fish with a gaping mouth is slid in front of Zoe. Zoe sits and stares at her dinner in horror, as Kate squeezes lemon over her fish. Zoe shakes her head. Kate's smile fades and she looks disappointed, as Zoe gets up and leaves the table. Zoe sits in her bedroom, playing with a red-haired rag doll. Zoe looks sadly down at her doll, as Kate goes. Patrons sitting in a window table smile and chat as they enjoy a meal. Kate rounds a corner and enters the restaurant, walking straight past Paula who's standing by the door chatting to two customers. Kate makes her way through the crowded dining area. Hearing singing, Kate slows down as she nears the kitchen. She meets Bernadette coming out with two plates. Kate walks into the kitchen. Leah's standing with a man holding a pastry brush. The man turns. He conducts. Kate watches in disbelief, as the man raises his arms in the air and sings to the staff. He's holding an uncooked quail in his other hand. Kate turns to Paula. Kate whisks the man's coat off him. Paula leads the couple to their table. Kate and Paula go into a small glass-fronted room filled with well-stocked, floor-to-ceiling wine racks. Kate's speechless. She looks over at Nick, who stands grinning at her. Kate points at a pan on the stove next to him. The contents have caught fire. Kate shakes her head at Paula in disbelief, then grabs her bag and heads out. A flicker of a smile plays on Paula's lips. Kate wearily climbs the stairs to her apartment. A packet of chopsticks have been sellotaped to her door. She bends down and picks up a plastic take-away bag. She takes the chopsticks off the door and walks inside. She walks down the hallway to Zoe's bedroom. Kate pokes her head around the open door, then tries to enter her own bedroom. The door won't budge. She forces it open a crack. Kate sees Zoe curled up, asleep on her bed. Kate walks into the bathroom and enters her bedroom through an adjoining door. A chair has been propped up against the bedroom door to prevent anyone from entering. Kate walks over and moves it aside, along with a wicker laundry basket. Kate steps slowly towards the bed and picks up the remote control, which is lying next to Zoe. She turns off the TV. Kate looks down at her sleeping niece, then places the remote on a chest of drawers. She gently covers Zoe with the bedclothes, then notices as photo album, which had been hidden beneath them. Kate moves the photo album around and begins to look through it.",
    "879": "Kate looks quizzically at Leah, who smiles and gestures towards Nick. He turns around and nods with a smile. Zoe frowns at Nick. Leah, wearing a thick winter coat, slings her bag over her shoulder as she leaves the staff changing room. Kate walks into her office, where Zoe is slumped over the desk fast asleep. Kate places a scarf around her neck and looks down at her drawing of a sailboat and a dolphin that Zoe's resting on. Kate carries Zoe through the kitchen. As she reaches the door, she turns back to Nick with a warm smile. He looks back at her kindly and watches them go. In Zoe's dark bedroom, Kate lays her sleeping niece down gently onto the bed. She undoes the laces on Zoe's red and white baseball boots and removes them. She places one of Zoe's stuffed toys down beside her. Zoe immediately cuddles up to it. Next morning, Kate reaches out to turn off her square-faced alarm clock, which reads half-past four. She turns onto her back and opens her eyes sleepily. Kate pulls on a dark Berber-style jacket as she walks through to the lounge to pick up her mobile. She heads towards the front door. Kate peers back up the hallway at Zoe, who's standing in her bedroom doorway clutching her cuddly Kangaroo. At the fish market, a bored-looking Zoe stands nearby. She's still clutching her cuddly toy. She yawns sleepily. Back at home, Kate and Zoe are asleep on the sofa. Kate stares. She checks her watch. Kate hurries off. Later, they run along the pavement to the school. Kate watches Zoe as she climbs the front steps, opens the heavy front door and goes inside. At the restaurant, Kate and Leah are with a mustachioed man. Leah sniffs it. He reaches into a bag. He conducts Leah, as she breathes deeply. Kate walks into her apartment with a smile. Her long, dark hair hanging loose in large, soft waves. She hangs her bag on a hook by the door, drops her keys into the bowl and begins to remove her coat. Her smile suddenly disappears. She grabs her keys and her bag and scurries out again. In a taxi. Kate jumps out of the taxi and hurries towards the school. Zoe's sitting on the steps. Zoe ignores her. Zoe stands up and strides peevishly towards the yellow cab. Kate follows her and gets in beside her. She pulls the door shut. At home, Zoe stomps straight into her bedroom. Kate walks into hers. Kate's bedroom door opens. She slowly steps out into the hallway. She crosses to Zoe's room and hesitates for a moment, before knocking on the door.",
    "881": "She leads Kate by the hand. A picnic is laid out on the lounge floor. Sitting on cushions in front of a roaring fire, under a sheet stretched out like a safari tent, the trio share the pizza. Zoe pretends to be an elephant. The three then play pick-up sticks with bread sticks. By the light of several candles, Zoe acts out a charade. Wax drips down tall candlesticks beside a half-empty cafetiere of coffee. Zoe's fast asleep on a cushion. Nick crawls round to Zoe and lifts her from the floor. His shadow casts on the side of the sheet tent as he carries her out. Kate takes out a small tray with two espresso cups on it. She pauses to look down the hallway and watch Nick, as he gently carries Zoe to her bedroom. She turns back and stares ahead thoughtfully. Later, the pair are tidying up. Nick opens the fridge and takes out the Tupperware box Kate found in his bag. They sit on the lounge floor with a tiramisu between them. Kate's face brightens as she tastes a spoonful. The candles and firelight illuminate the room. Nick moves across to sit beside Kate. Nick reaches out and wipes a spot of cream from the right side of Kate's mouth. He licks the cream from his finger, and gazes intently at her. Kate's face is turned towards Nick. She looks away briefly and nods. He reaches behind Kate and moves nearer. Lips almost touching, she leans back against his arm. Kate shifts awkwardly as Nick puts on his scarf. He stands, picks up his jacket from the back of the sofa and puts it on as he enters the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants. Kate smiles serenely to herself. At the therapist. He spins around in his leather chair. Kate furrows her brow. Kate joins the headmistress in her spacious office. Kate leaves. In the park, Zoe is walking on the benches. Zoe runs off. Kate chases after her. Zoe narrowly avoids being hit by a Yellow Cab as she runs across a busy road. Kate dodges the traffic to follow her. Kate steps back and watches helplessly as Zoe runs off. Later, Zoe is on her bed looking at the photo album. As Zoe flicks through the album, she finds a peacock feather like the one she was playing with shortly before the car crash. She sighs and her eyes well with tears. Kate goes down to Sean's apartment. In the dark and deserted kitchen, Kate and Nick share a plate of food and drink red wine across the serving counter. They talk happily together. In the pouring rain, Nick dashes out of his truck outside Kate's apartment building.",
    "884": "Lizzie makes her way over to Charlotte, who shows her into a room where they are left alone again. Charlotte then takes Lizzie into the drawing room and walks over to the window. Later, Lizzie is sitting reading in her room while Maria rushes to look out the window at a carriage that's arrived. The party makes its way up a wide path leading to a majestic mansion with elegantly manicured gardens, where Lady Catherine is holding court in her drawing room. Sitting on an ornate, throne-like chair, she looks at Lizzie, who's squashed between Maria and Sir William on a sofa. Lady Catherine raises one eyebrow and turns her attention to Charlotte, but as she turns to Lizzie, her smile fades and she glares fiercely. Maria, Charlotte, and Lizzie are walking outside in the gardens. In the house, Darcy rises from his seat and comes to stand over Lizzie, making no effort to make any further inquiries. He strides slowly and pointedly over to the window, where he stands with his back to the room. Lizzie looks at Fitzwilliam, and Darcy turns to look at her, smiles, and then turns back to the window, poker-faced. It's a bright, sunny day with the wooded green fields of the English countryside stretching out to the horizon. Lizzie wanders alone, taking in the sumptuous view, idly patting the trunk of a large tree as she passes by, and continues on under the shady canopy of leaves, taking her time staring up into the branches that shield her from the glare of the sun. Darcy is riding his horse through the woods, a picture of elegance in his top hat and frock coat. Spying Lizzie, he brings his horse to a halt, never once taking his eyes off her. Lizzie stops, nonchalantly crossing her arms in front of her, and stares up defiantly at Darcy. Looking awkward, Darcy kicks his horse on, and they set off down the avenue of trees at a trot. Lizzie watches them, not quite knowing what to make of the encounter. Later, Fitzwilliam sits with Lizzie as she plays the piano. In an adjoining room, Lady Catherine is listening, with Darcy, Charlotte, and Maria sitting on a sofa near her. Darcy goes in to join Lizzie and Fitzwilliam, and they share an intense gaze. At the sound of the front doorbell, Lizzie sets down her pen, gets up from the writing table, and checks that her hair's straight. The maid shows Darcy in, who bows stiffly as the maid curtsies and leaves the room. Lizzie takes a seat, and a rather awkward silence ensues between them with neither quite able to look the other in the eye. Eventually, Darcy pulls out a chair and sits down.",
    "886": "Watching her pass by, his eyes linger on her for a long moment as she talks to Charlotte, however, when he realizes they're discussing him, he turns away. Miss Bingley is tolerating the dancing, wheeling in and out with a haughty air in her green silk gown and fashionable feather hat, while Lizzie is up with Bingley and having a much better time of it. Mrs. Bennet watches with glee as Jane and Bingley happily dance together, though Darcy's not so pleased. At the party, Mary is playing the piano with several men, in the red and gold brocade uniforms of their regiment, milling amongst the party-goers and Lydia and Kitty surrounded by officers. Darcy stands, watching proceedings with his customary aloof air. On the opposite side of the room, Lizzie catches his brooding stare and is, for the briefest moment, affected by it, before she quickly composes herself and turns to Colonel Forster. The Bingley sisters share a look as Lydia grabs a young boy and girl by the hand and leads them on to the floor with several officers joining them. Lizzie turns and looks at the intimate pair and Mr. Darcy becomes aware of them looking at him and glowers. Lydia is dancing playfully as Lizzie makes her way across the room and Darcy watches Lizzie go. Miss Bingley sidles up to him, looking decidedly put out, but as she backs away from him, his gaze remains on Lizzie. Now, the Bennets' dining room, Mr. Bennet raises his eyebrows. Now, Jane is riding Nellie through a rainstorm, she's soaked through. At home, Lizzie looks with concern at the storm outside, she gives her mother a reproachful look. Jane continues, making slow progress, now, she's seated in an ornate dining room, eating dinner with Bingley's sisters and Miss Bingley gives her a patronizing smile. Jane closes her eyes, looking faint. Now, the Bennets are eating breakfast. Lizzie, Lydia, and Kitty are walking arm-in-arm through Meryton, Lydia looks around distractedly, and they scurry away together. Lizzie is walking through a field, holding her bonnet in her hand. She climbs over a stile, the hem of her pale dress already caked in mud, she lands in a quagmire, her boots are filthy, she gives a good-natured shrug and carries on her way. She trots over the field towards Netherfield Hall, standing proudly in the distance. As she gets closer, she walks under the shadow of a tree, then startled when Darcy emerges around a corner, he is equally startled, she curtsies, becomes a little embarrassed, he disguises a look of amusement, then steps aside for her to pass and follows her, as she strides towards the Hall.",
    "888": "Caroline Bingley paces the room, holding an open book in her hands. Mr. Bingley prods the fire with his foot. Miss Bingley walks over to Darcy, who's engrossed in a book. She flirtatiously leans on his chair in order to read over his shoulder. He ignores her and turns the page. With malevolent intent in her eyes, she crosses to Lizzie. Lizzie looks around her awkwardly, then shuts her book, stands, and sets off, arms linked, around the room with Miss Bingley. He considers this for a moment. Miss Bingley attempts to break the palpable tension by crossing to the piano. Darcy and Lizzie steadily hold each other's gazes. Jane and Lizzie are in a two-horse carriage. He beams at her. Bingley steps away from the door, still grinning. He raises a hand to bid them farewell. As the carriage leaves, Darcy watches its progress from a window. He remains staring out of the window. Now inside the carriage, Jane smiles dreamily. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie is walking through the countryside. Green leaves are starting to turn brown. She watches the progress of geese flying through the sky overhead. At the Bennet's dining table, he gives them a look. An austere-looking woman. The obsequious Mr. Collins pulls up. He clumsily climbs down from the carriage, causing Jane to stifle a giggle. He bows to them reverentially. Now, a lavish dinner. Lizzie gives her father a look. Lizzie giggles. Mr. Collins gives Jane an ingratiating smile. Now the family is outside amusing themselves in the gardens. Mr. Collins is walking with Mrs. Bennet. He looks at the girls carefully. Lydia and Kitty are playing a game with hoops, Mary studying a book, and finally Lizzie, laughing and smiling with Jane. He bustles over to her. She looks uncertain. Now the sisters are walking over a stone bridge, accompanied by Mr. Collins. He's exhausted from the walk. They make their way into the village, carriages rolling past and people talking on corners. Lydia and Kitty rush ahead and stop at a shop window. Denny crosses to meet them with his companion. Bingley and Darcy ride by. He dismounts from his gray horse, and joins them. Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy spot each other. A look passes between them before Mr. Wickham lifts his hat to him. Lizzie watches the exchange with interest. Lizzie studies Darcy as he rides away sitting stiff and proper in the saddle. Lizzie and Kitty race in followed by Mary. He backs away from them, and takes a seat at a card table. Lizzie looks grateful for his departure. Mary starts playing the piano. At the whist table, Mr. Collins lays down a card, much to Mrs. Phillips's disgust.",
    "889": "He falters for a moment, then his smile returns. Lydia and Kitty are enjoying a card game with the officers. Mr. Wickham, now resplendent in his red uniform, watches them with amusement before sitting down next to Lizzie. He leans forward in his seat. They smile at Lydia's celebrations. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Her eyes meet Mr. Wickham's and they smile at each other warmly. She watches him dance with Lydia and smiles to herself. A bedroom. She lowers her eyes coyly. Jane looks unsure. He giggles. A look between Lizzie and Jane. Lydia and Kitty are being pushed on a swing by two uniformed officers. Mr. Collins reluctantly follows Jane leaving Wickham and Lizzie alone. They stroll through the garden together. She turns to him. They watch as Kitty jumps from the swing into the arms of an officer. Then, they set off walking again. Lizzie smiles contentedly to herself. Now, Mrs. Bennet rushes into Lizzie's room, where a maid is seeing to her hair. Lizzie pops out her cheeks. She runs out of the room. Mr. Collins is leaving his room. He's shocked to bump into the half-dressed Lydia. He tries to pass her but the landing is too small. He covers his eyes and walks hurriedly past the giggling Lydia. Knowing the laughter is at him, he regains his composure before heading down the stairs. Night time at Netherfield Hall. A constant stream of carriages drop guests at the doors. Mr. Collins helps Lizzie and Jane down from their carriage. As they make their way up a flight of steps, Lizzie spots Darcy looking out of a window. He catches her eye, then turns away. The family makes its way inside, where their cloaks are taken by footmen in wigs. Jane and Lizzie look around the room excitedly before being received by the Bingleys. Lizzie steps away from her family and looks around the room searchingly. Mr. Bingley standing with Jane calls over to her. He offers her his arm, then leads them both through to the next room. Musicians are playing at one end of a large wooden-floored room. Mr. Bingley escorts the sisters proudly through the gathered guests, nodding greetings to uniformed officers and finely attired ladies. Lizzie looks around the other guests while Jane and Bingley chatter happily together. A hopeful smile plays across her lips when she spots a group of red-coated officers gathered in a corner. Darcy is standing a little behind the group. He turns his head, and he and Lizzie catch each other's eye for a moment before she hastily looks away. He continues looking at her. A beautiful smile crosses her face, when Denny breaks away from the others and joins her.",
    "890": "They both look over at Darcy, who glowers before striding away. Lydia and Kitty drag Denny and the other officer away. Lizzie looks puzzled and a little disappointed. Her bad humor disappears when she spies Charlotte across the room. She hurries over to her happily. He holds out a hand to Lizzie, who reluctantly takes it, and they cross the floor to join the dance. Mr. Collins, all in black, prances over to the lady next to Lizzie. They curtsey and bow, circle each other. Then, he returns to the line of men. As Lizzie dances, Mr. Collins leers at her. Then, normally, makes to follow her in the dance. Darcy is watching with amusement. Lizzie sees him looking and glares. Darcy's face drops and then returns to his usual stern composure. He slowly walks around the dancers passing Mrs. Bennet deep in conversation. He watches Jane and Bingley performing the intricate moves of the dance. As they cross each other, briefly holding each other's outstretched hands, Darcy seems to take more of an interest in them. He looks contemptuously at Lydia dancing with gay abandon with the officers. Darcy turns back on himself stopping by flickering candles. His eyes once more drawn back to Lizzie, skipping in a circle with her dance set, her dark hair swinging like a ponytail. Darcy's gaze is steady. His high white shirt collar and dark coat frame his stern features. Another dance is taking place. Charlotte and Lizzie are talking. Darcy is standing before them. He bows. They curtsy in return. He bows once more and leaves. Lizzie resignedly leaves Charlotte's sight. With the men on one side of the floor and women on the other, Lizzie and Darcy stand opposite to each other looking serious. The men slowly bow and the dance begins. The gentlemen and the ladies grasp each other's hands, and circle one way, then the other. Lizzie and Darcy maintain steady eye-contact throughout. As they move away from each other, then double back to cross over. A slight smile is playing across Lizzie's lips. Darcy's face betrays no emotion. They form a straight line with another couple before releasing hands, turning and coming to a brief halt facing each other. The dance forces them away from each other. She sighs heavily raising her eyebrows. They circle each other holding hands. Darcy is still serious. The passing of the dance leads Lizzie away for a moment, then back again. They separate to allow a couple to move between them. Then they return to being opposite to one another. Lizzie hides a look of amusement as the dance continues. The nine couples move in unison watched by other guests, a magnificent chandelier hanging over their heads.",
    "894": "The older newcomer takes a seat. Purvis approaches. Horses barrel down a racetrack, jockeys crouched on their backs. An announcer watches from a tower. Onlookers crowd the rails. Among them, Billie grins, Dillinger beside her. In cheers, the horses race shoulder to shoulder. Later, outside the racetrack, Nitti and D'Andrea sit by a patio table by a grassy crowd. Nitti summons a breath, squinting in the sunlight. D'Andrea waves at Dillinger across the crowd. D'Andrea glances around. Later, Dillinger plumps into a chair in the grandstand. Billie sits beside him. One row down, Pete leans closer. Homer listens too. Homer speaks up. Dillinger faces his girlfriend, who glares at him, then drops her gaze. D'Andrea joins him. D'Andrea leaves. Billie stares off. Dillinger frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces Billie. She hangs her head. Billie allows a thoughtful smile. Leaning forward, she cups the back of Dillinger's head in her hand, and presses her lips to his. He pulls away, gazing into her eyes, and kisses her again. Spectators stand and cheer on the race. Now in a town, a brambly bush grows by a biro cactus and a healthy saguaro. Billie and Dillinger enter the lobby and stroll toward the front desk. A balding clerk faces them. The clerk hands Dillinger a pen. The gang leader signs a guest register. Dillinger picks up a suitcase and heads off with Billie. Now in a hotel room, he opens the suitcase, takes out his Tommy gun and cocks it. Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed. The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun, and ambles to a set of closed double doors. Pushing one open, he peeks into a bathroom. Billie sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot. She runs her toes along a soap dish. As Johnny turns back to the bedroom, the door bursts open. The balding man from the front desk leads other men in and clouds Dillinger with the butt of a rifle. As another lawman handcuffs him, Billie runs out wearing a towel. Later, the lawmen lead Dillinger into a jail as more officers escort Pete and the heavyset bank robber. Pete struggles as his captors lead him away from his boss. A lawman shuts a door, showing an isolated cellblock. Inside, the officers lock Dillinger inside a holding cell and remove his handcuffs through the bars. Wearing cowboy hats, the officers head out. Dillinger massages his wrists, gazing off. He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next.",
    "896": "Five cars follow the motorcyclists along a dim street. In Dillinger's car, the criminal stares off glumly, then smiles out the window. Dozens of civilians line the street, cheering. The gang leader raises his shackled hands and waves. A young man rushes toward the window. Dillinger's eyes gleam as other fans wave excitedly. He gives a coy, half smile. Later, the convoy drives onto a bridge, passing a set of raised barricades. Now, in a courthouse, a deputy shoves his way through a crowd of journalists, toward a counter. Behind the counter, a plainly dressed woman paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd. As arriving lawmen lead Dillinger inside, cameras flash. The robber skeptically furrows his brow. An officer unlocks Dillinger's wrist restraints. A chubby lawyer puts an arm around Dillinger who rests an elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff glowers. Dillinger shrugs his brows. Dillinger swaggers off, escorted by deputies. Later, a guard unlocks a cellblock door and a deputy guides a portly lawyer inside. The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. Now, a hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells and enters a common room where Dillinger reads a newspaper. The hulking man leans to Dillinger's ear. Dillinger scowls toward his cell then heads over. The hulking inmate positions himself just outside. He waves two prisoners on. Now, Dillinger faces the bars in the back of his cell. The lawyer, Piquett, sits in a corridor on the other side. Piquett sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel bench. A deputy escorts Dillinger in, in shackles. Piquett faces the deputy. The judge folds his hands thoughtfully. Bob turns away with a humorless look. As the crowd rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett. The lawyer steps away. As the deputy approaches, Dillinger lowers his gaze. Later, outside the jail, a cluster of National Guardsmen stand watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags. Inside, the prisoners mill about the common room. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters. Later, he hangs up his coat. A guard unlocks a barred door then raises his baton to a second metal door just inside. The guard looks through a peephole then unlocks the door for the janitor. Carrying a mop and bucket, he crosses a hallway and waits for another guard to open another barred door. In the common room, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw. The janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder. The janitor sets down his supplies and heads over. Dillinger grabs Cahoon by the back of his jacket and points an odd, waxy gun at his head.",
    "897": "He pushes Cahoon toward the door and the hulking inmate follows close behind. Dillinger hides against a wall. Cahoon peaks through the bars. As the guard opens the door, Dillinger pushes Cahoon away and slams Brian into the wall. The hulking inmate covers Cahoon's mouth. Dillinger spins Brian to the next door, pointing the waxy weapon at his back. Brian refuses. Dillinger pokes Brian with the gun. He shoves Brian to his hulking accomplice, who still restrains Cahoon. Dillinger eyes the door. He kicks it open and hits the guard in the face. Max tumbles down a flight of stairs with Dillinger close behind. His accomplice holds a pipe in his raised hand as he pushes Brian behind Dillinger. Using Max's keys, Dillinger opens the next barred door then forces Max to stand in front of a metal door. The guard on the other side peeks through then unlocks it. As he opens the door, Dillinger shoves him into Max and his accomplice hits Brian with his pipe. Dillinger rushes into the office and holds his gun to the warden's neck. He pushes the warden into the hall while his accomplice restrains a deputy. As Dillinger jams the barrel of his gun into the warden's neck, the warden spins the dial on a safe door. Dillinger steps into the closet sized safe, discards his fake, waxy gun and grabs a pistol from the wall. He steps out with a rifle and hands a machine gun to his accomplice. The warden glances back as the accomplice leads him away. Dillinger grabs a hat and coat from a nearby rack. He puts them on and tosses a jacket to the other inmate who grabs a hat from the rack as he ushers the deputy out behind Dillinger. With his rifle raised, Dillinger cautiously opens a metal door in the hallway. His accomplice follows close behind with one hand clutching the deputy between them. They make their way into a garage where a mechanic works on a police car. Dillinger reaches into one of the cars and rips out its ignition wires. He strides to the Ford V8. Outside, four officers talk to each other on a porch, their guns perched casually against their shoulders. The sleek Ford passes undetected in the alley beside them. At the front of the jailhouse, the National Guardsmen mill about by their sandbag wall. As Dillinger drives through the town, he nervously shifts his eyes back under the tipped down brim of his fedora. The jailhouse mechanic sits beside him while his accomplice rides in back with the deputy. Dillinger notices three National Guardsmen strolling down the sidewalk. He stops for a red traffic light on a corner where more National Guardsmen stand together talking, their guns strapped over their shoulders.",
    "9": "An arrangement of fresh-cut roses in a vase sits on a counter against a white tile wall. The tile is suddenly sprayed with blood, matching the deep crimson of the roses. Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. Ricky opens the door from the dining room and stops, with Jane appearing behind him. A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. Ricky enters the kitchen, slowly approaching Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. He kneels, gazing at Lester's face. Lester looks back, his eyes lifeless but smiling slightly. We're flying across a white blanket of clouds. Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at a dot of light falling across an unbelievably starry sky. Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed, looking at each other alarmed. Maple trees in autumn shed ghostly leaves that flutter slowly toward the pavement. Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her makeup, then turns, frightened. Close on an ancient woman's papery hands as they button a cardigan sweater. Carolyn walks slowly toward a red door, drenched to the bone, clutching her purse tightly. A 1970 Pontiac Firebird is in the driveway of a suburban home, the sun's reflection in the windshield. The Colonel enters, wet, wearing latex gloves, blood covering the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of his gun cases, the glass door open, a gun conspicuously missing. Jane opens her bedroom door, staring. A door opens to reveal 4-year-old Jane, dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit sparkler aloft and smiling shyly. Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her purse. She shuts the door and locks it, takes the Glock 19 out of her purse, opens the closet door, and shoves the gun into a hamper. Suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs his clothes and pulls them to her, burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and begins to cry. In black and white, a younger Carolyn sits in a spinning-teacup ride, laughing uncontrollably. We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier, of an empty white plastic bag being blown about by the wind. It carries the bag in a circle, sometimes whipping it about violently, or sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground.",
    "900": "As Red and Homer return fire, Baby Face shoots at a townsman with a pistol at his side. Dillinger crawls to the dead gangster, looks sadly at Tommy, then turns his attention back to the fight. As Baby Face raises his gun to fire again, a guy jumps on his back. Baby Face tosses him into a window. Dillinger joins the others, firing at the second story window across the street. Dust billows around it as bullets hit the exterior stone wall. Red glances over his shoulder. Dillinger reloads his gun and fires it at a man hiding behind a car. He hurries to Baby Face and drags him, who continues to shoot. With its door still open, the car pulls out of the town square, leaving the hostages lying helplessly in the street. The car speeds down an empty road lined with tall evergreens that jut into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow covered ground bordering the woods. Dillinger sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair. In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, Dillinger drinks from a flask as Red administers an injection into his shoulder wound. Night time. The car's headlights glow eerily through the trees as it makes its way through the dark woods. The night casts a turquoise hue over Dillinger who clutches his shoulder in the backseat. The car slows as it approaches a lodge where light shines warmly through the windows. As Baby Face pulls the car to a halt, Dillinger addresses him with a frown. The four gangsters enter the lodge. Upstairs, Baby Face bundles cash. As Red preps a dressing, Homer looks on. Red unrolls a bandage and dresses Dillinger's wound. Homer grabs his take. Baby Face picks up two cash bundles and tosses one to Shouse. As they both clear out of the room, Homer hangs by in the doorway. He looks to Dillinger. The leader gives a nod and Homer leaves. Red remains seated at Dillinger's side. As Red wipes his hands, Dillinger springs restlessly to his feet. The two men share a solemn look. He holds out Red's share. Red accepts the cash, gives his brow a resigned lift and shoots a tentative smile at Dillinger. He stows the cash in his bag and leaves. Now in a medical exam room, the gangster with the eye wound pleads with two G-men. Purvis halts a doctor. Purvis courteously gestures for the doctor to step away. The interrogator pushes on the man's wound. Purvis stands with his back to the torture session. The gangster spits at his tormentor. The stern faced G-man turns gravely towards Purvis and nods.",
    "901": "Purvis's beady eyes peer downward, deep in thought. Later, Purvis uses a candlestick phone. On the other end, a boyish agent, Sam Cowley, nods, hangs up, and grabs some maps. As Sam's team arms up, Purvis and his armed peers board a prop plane on an airfield. Now, under a dim table lamp, a hand turns on a boxy radio. He lies down on a modest twin bed. Dillinger picks up his pocket watch off the nightstand, opens it and admires a photo of Billie on the inside of the cover. Dillinger's profile grows blurry as the view focuses on the radio beyond. Now, on a forest road, two motorcars douse their headlights as they creep forward and park on the dirt shoulder. Purvis, Winstead, and several others in trench coats climb out of the vehicles. Purvis closes his door most of the way but leaves it cracked open. The men advance. Armed with their rifles and sub machineguns, the G-men cross the shadowy woods. Purvis and Winstead stand shoulder to shoulder as they spot the lodge a few hundred yards off. Purvis looks Winstead in the eye. The partner G-men filter outwards through the trees toward the lodge. Inside a warmly lit barroom. Outside, Purvis passes in and out of light as he treads forward. Toting a rifle, Baum comes up on his left. Meanwhile, Winstead rounds past a tree. Inside, Baby Face approaches a couple eating dinner. He pats a guy on a barstool then faces the couple. Outside, Purvis spies a window framing a view of two women, a tuxedoed man and a fourth person drinking and smoking inside. As he stalks closer, the tree working class men exit the lodge. Purvis watches them closely from behind a tree. Inside Dillinger's room, a framed religious icon hangs on the wall over his bed as he rests. Outside, the car backs up. Purvis aims his Tommy gun. The car starts forward. Purvis and two of his peers open fire. The shots knock out the headlights and riddle the car from top to bottom with holes. Inside, Dillinger springs awake. Grabs his Tommy gun and goes to a window. In the barroom Baby Face returns fire through a window, as does Dillinger from the second story. As mussel flashes light up the night, indoors and out, Winstead carefully lines up a rifle shot from the base of a tree. Now in Dillinger's room, Wedge joins the shootout. As Purvis sprints for a tree closer to the disabled car, Baby Face unleashes a barrage of fire from a barroom window. Purvis takes cover and reloads. As he makes a run for the car, shells fires from the launch. Outside, Purvis sees the car's lifeless occupants.",
    "904": "He pops off his cuffs, pulls out a Tommy gun and bashes the guard. The officer points his own shotgun through the barred door. A guard quickly opens it, and they barge in just as the escapees force their captives into the room. As the guards strip, Dillinger shakes hands with the older inmate. Dillinger unlocks the steel door. The stocky escapee faces a guard. As Dillinger opens the door, the impersonating officer steps outside. Dillinger shuts the door behind him. Outside, Red leaves the metal gate behind and crosses the open ground towards the sedan. He glances back to the lookout turret. Inside Dillinger waits with his Tommy gun as the gang continues to dress. One guard faces the stocky inmate. He smashes the defiant law man with his pipe. A guard reaches for the younger inmate's gun. The younger inmate shoots him, which captures the rest of the room's attention. Outside, Red walks backward 20 yards from the gate. Inside the criminals run out, leaving their hostages behind. On the lookout turret, guards take aim. Dillinger crosses through the metal gate, followed by his now partially dressed gang. As the escapees race past him, Dillinger faces the entrance and fires his Tommy gun up at the watch tower. One escapee gets shot despite a barrage of gun fire from Dillinger and his armed cohorts. Walter hurries from the gate, still limping. His sandy haired accomplice helps him along and fires back at the tower. Inside the turret, a guard goes down. As Walter reaches the getaway car, another guard fires a rifle. Shot in the back, Walter collapses. Standing on the running board, Dillinger grabs his arm as they drive away. His body dragging across the dirt, Walter hangs onto Dillinger's arm, grimacing in pain. Dillinger struggles to keep his grip while holding onto the moving car himself. Walter looks up to his old friend and grins. Then his hardened face goes blank. His grip on Dillinger's forearm gives way, and the gang leader lets him go. Walter's body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Dillinger lingers for a moment and climbs into the back of the moving sedan. As the sandy haired escapee shuts the door, Dillinger puts a handgun to Shouse's neck. Red drives, sitting next to the younger escapee. Dillinger lowers his handgun and punches Shouse in the face a couple of times. He opens the car door and throws him out of the moving vehicle. Shouse lands on the side of the road, face down in the grass. Dillinger closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy haired Pete.",
    "905": "Purvis empties his pistol into the man. Baby Face drops onto his back, a plume of exhaled steam jets from his nose, once. Purvis glares over his aimed pistol. Outside a small-town pharmacy, Dillinger returns to the heisted car. Red leans, sweating and bloody, in the corner of the back seat. Dillinger pours antiseptic over Red's wounded abdomen, fusses with other supplies, and applies gauze to the wound. Red trains his puffy, exhausted eyes on Dillinger. A feeble smile on Red's lips fades. Dillinger slumps a little, then sits back. His blood-stained hand lets go of Red's shoulder. Eyes downcast, Dillinger stays seated by his deceased partner. He swallows, glancing at Red. His lips give a brief, irritated sneer. He gazes downward. In a field office, Purvis faces his agents. Night time. On a city street, a scowling Dillinger drives past a parked car, which reflects electrical flashes from a passing train. Two agents sit in the parked vehicle. One, a burly man with a Roman nose, peers at an apartment building across the street. His partner sleeps. In the apartment, a seated Billie checks her watch, then turns up a radio. Windows behind her show the passing train. Billie crosses the roomy, run-down apartment, then doubles back to a door. A woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands Billie a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As Billie dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes Billie's seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to Billie's. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows. In the car, both G-men watch the apartment. In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora toting a paper bag across a dark alley. The stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall. It's Billie in disguise. She comes to a street on the other end. Carrying the brown paper bag, she steps off the sidewalk between parked cars and looks around in the middle of the street. A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face. Situated about a block away, the car approaches and comes to a stop. Billie hops in next to Dillinger, who chews gum and smiles. Billie takes off the hat, kisses his cheek, and holds him. Dillinger drives off. Billie rests her head on his shoulder. In the field office, Purvis and his agents listen to Madala. The agents abruptly gaze out the door. Purvis steps forward, arms folded across his chest. In the outer office, the solemn, burly agent stands with his partner. As Purvis gazes at them, his eyes water.",
    "906": "He works his lips. Nitti listens to the radio, then phones D'Andrea. At the telephone exchange, cardboard tags label switchboard cables. As an agent stands by, two female operators work an adjacent switchboard. Outside, on a moonlit shoreline, Dillinger sits by a sleeping Billie, her hair hanging in her face. He gazes at her and brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes. She briefly lowers her gaze, then smiles, and he takes her in his arm. Beyond them, the horizon sprawls perfectly flat between the sand and black sky. Later, Dillinger's car parks on a street. Billie smiles at him and gets out of the car. Peering through his round sunglasses, Dillinger watches her go and looks into his side view mirror, seeing only a man at a mailbox, a vagrant, and a few pedestrians. In her fur-collared coat, Billie crosses the street between passing vehicles and enters the building. In the car, Dillinger faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, Billie passes through another doorway where Purvis' men grab her and handcuff her. She uncomfortably glances at the agents. Outside, Dillinger waits in the car as more armed agents exit a building directly in front of him. He startles slightly, but the G-men step right past, realizing he's inside, and cross the street. Dillinger takes off his sunglasses. The agents restraining Billie indoors lead her outside. Dillinger glares into his side mirror, then gets out of the car. The two lovers make eye contact as the burly agent marches Billie away, shoving her toward a government car. Dillinger steps forwards with a pistol in hand. The burly agent pushes Billie into the back seat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, Billie peers through the back window, sitting between two agents. A shocked Dillinger stands out in the open, watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind on the sidewalk but fail to notice Dillinger, who strides around a parked car and returns to his vehicle. He gets in and shuts the door. Gripping the steering wheel, he bows his head and collects his breath. His car backs out, and Dillinger leaves the remaining agents behind. He wipes his reddened face and holds a hand over his mouth as he sobs. In a dim interrogation room, the burly agent leans in front of Billie, who sits in a chair, his partner standing behind her. She slouches, her left cheek bruised. The interrogator smacks her and grabs her chin, then flings her head to the side and stands upright before stepping out of the room. Billie trembles, her right hand cuffed to the chair, holding her knees together.",
    "907": "In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris, who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room. The interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes Billie. He crosses to her and grabs her chin, then grabs her chin again and shakes her. Billie's mouth hangs open, she shudders, and her lips tremble as she finds words. The two agents leave her. On the way through the field office, the interrogator points to Doris, who holds the telephone at her shoulder. He puts on his jacket. The other men gather their things and move out. Doris dials her telephone. The agents run up a stairwell. Standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges. They rush in. Daylight filters into a bare room through an open window. The place is empty. The burly agent stiffens his jaw. Back in the interrogation room, Billie sits with her head down. The two agents barge in. The burly one grabs a phone book and whacks her with it. She keeps her head down, then looks directly at him. As Purvis enters the field office, Doris approaches him. Billie lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth. Billie looks him in the eye. He sneers and winds up with his fist. Winstead intercepts his arm and slams him against the wall. Purvis enters. The other interrogator quickly uncuffs Billie's right arm from the chair. As she holds her wrist, Purvis leans over to her. He stands upright. Billie presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops. Purvis glances at the other interrogator, then lifts Billie from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. In the interrogation room, Winstead lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Purvis nods to Doris. She escorts them. The burly agent stays put beside the open door, out of the sightline of his peers, who stare in from the hall. At a pool hall, Marty dials a pay phone. At his home, Nitti answers. A woman sits at a bar. A door opens across the room. Marty enters and takes a seat next to her. Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead. Then she looks directly at Marty. He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes. They pick up their drinks and share another glance. They both sip. At night, a lake reflects city lights. Marty leads Anna to a car. She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver.",
    "908": "Purvis sits at the wheel while Anna, averting her gaze, gets out of the car. Purvis' gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle. Meanwhile, Dillinger, wearing a straw boater hat and sporting a trimmed mustache, holds a gun in his pocket and peeks around a tree. He steps out to meet Piquett and they sit on a roadside park bench. Piquett reaches into his coat and Dillinger unfolds a page to reveal a handwritten message reading, \"I am too well guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway.\" Dillinger folds up the note, stands, and walks away. Piquett puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction. Now at a stone wall, Dillinger, Alvin Karpis, and other men look down at an idying steam locomotive. Alvin turns away from Dillinger, who stares ahead. Anna sits at the kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine when Dillinger enters. He crosses the room, and Anna's fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him. Dillinger glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen. He goes to the sink and washes his hands. Anna glances at the door as Polly emerges. Dillinger dries his hands with the towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave, and Anna remains at the table, covering her mouth with her hand. Madala crosses the field office to Purvis, who sits on a desk and eagerly talks on the call. As he listens, Winstead looks up from a newspaper. Purvis lowers the phone and turns to his peers. The agents gather, and all eyes turn to Winstead. Madala checks a newspaper. Dillinger pulls up to a building with Polly. They enter the building through a set of double doors and she goes off. Dillinger steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around. An elevator door opens and Dillinger steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer. He glances at the elevator operator as the door glides shut. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area. Daylight shines in through a window. Dillinger hikes up his pants as he enters the main office. He turns to a bulletin board where multiple mugshots of familiar criminals hang posted. He crosses to a desk and holds briefly by a secretary busy typing. A couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of Dillinger's presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings: a mugshot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses Dillinger's lips as he passes through a brilliant shaft of sunlight.",
    "909": "Dillinger finds black and white photos of himself farther along a bulletin board, with others showing more buildings. He lowers his sunglasses and views photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated Tommy guns. He crosses to a bulletin board showing mug shots of Billie, with the last mug shot of Dillinger himself remaining unstamped. Dillinger lowers his shades and meets his mug shot's stern gaze. He rounds a corner and spies a group of agents around the radio, with one man glancing over. Unrecognized, Dillinger moves on. In a cinema lobby, using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans the surroundings. Elsewhere, another agent ends the call and gazes across the street, shaking his head. At the wheel of a parked car, Madala looks to Purvis, seated shotgun. By a lamp's modest light, a shaving kit lies open on a small, round table with a handgun beside it. Facing a mirror, Dillinger drags a razor down his lathered cheek. He finishes shaving and opens his pocket watch, eying Billie's photo and the time. He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun. Parked near the Biograph, Purvis tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth. At the box office, a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze. He gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk, then stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema. Behind him, a man arrives with two blonde women, one of them in a conspicuous orange skirt. Purvis blinks, then looks over his shoulder. Spotting the trio, he looks away. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves Anna at her seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly. They find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen. In the packed audience, Dillinger stares intently at the screen through his spectacles. Outside, Purvis addresses his agents and pats Winstead's shoulder. The team splits up. In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, then Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in. Dillinger gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk. Gable shoots the man. Sitting on her own, Anna turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder. She faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, the agents take their positions. Winstead and Hurt duck into a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, Dillinger watches the screen with a furrowed brow. Leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. Dillinger gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw. In a fur-collared coat, the exotically pretty actress wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze. Later still, she turns away from a door clad in black.",
    "910": "Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod, then, blinking back tears, she opens the door and hurries out. Clark Gable stares after her while Dillinger watches with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis checks his watch, posted near the box office, he looks across the street where Winstead and Hurt wait patiently in the recessed storefront. Purvis turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby. On the movie screen, Clark Gable faces William Powell, dons a cocky smile, and turns away from Powell, who draws a deep breath and heads into a cellblock. A guard follows, closes a prison door, and locks it. Outside the theater, Purvis digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out, then from his breast pocket, he produces a cigar and holds it ready. On the movie screen, Gable makes his way down the cellblock, flanked by guards. Dillinger wears a faint, sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict, then wears a faint half-smile, his eyes shining. Outside, Purvis shifts his tense, vigilant gaze. In the movie house, words appear on the screen and the patrons stand, filing out of their rows. Anna tensely gets to her feet and looks around. A few rows down, Dillinger stands with Polly and dons his straw hat. Outside, Purvis watches the exiting patrons while, at the storefront, Winstead and Hurt stand ready. In the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel, his right hand trembling severely, using his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, Purvis watches movie patrons exiting the lobby, then faces the street, strikes the match, and lights his cigar. With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car. Dillinger steps into plain view, walking between Anna and Polly. The crime boss smiles thoughtfully and his younger friend wears a carefree grin. Keeping her pace, Anna holds a dour expression. Shoving a bystander aside, Purvis heads down the sidewalk after them. The burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised. Martin Zarkovich notices and roughly pushes two bystanders out of his way. Purvis moves with a deliberate stride and steady gaze while, across the street, Winstead and Hurt leave the recessed storefront. Meanwhile, the burly agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss. A few yards ahead, Dillinger frowns but maintains his wide swagger. Our view hovers at the back of Dillinger's head, then we see him frown and look over his shoulder and halt. As he and the burly agent lock gazes, the G-man's breathing grows shallow, he lowers his gun on him. Dillinger reaches into his pocket. Purvis tries to push between a couple. Winstead shoves between another pair, then brushes a man aside.",
    "911": "As Purvis struggles against the angry civilian, Winstead advances, and Dillinger sees him just feet away gripping a pistol. Slack-jawed, Purvis relaxes his aim as Winstead lines up a shot. The bullet pierces the back of Dillinger's skull and exits through his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front as Hurt fires twice from behind. Dillinger falls face down, eyes staring off, as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. Purvis stares, then ventures forward. As Dillinger lies dying, his lips move. Winstead removes his hat, crouches, and leans his ear close to Dillinger. The agent narrows his eyes, glances at the fallen man, and withdraws, revealing Dillinger's lifeless stare. Winstead gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man. He holsters his gun and Purvis joins his side. As the younger G-man eyes the body, Winstead dons his hat, his air stoic and grim. The older man faces him. Purvis eyes him long and steady. Winstead glances away, then looks Purvis in the eye. Marty leans in for a good look at Dillinger's body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze. Purvis takes another look at the body. A dozen civilians from the movie house rubber-neck as they move closer to the scene. A few yards off, Anna glances over her shoulder and slips away. Before the growing crowd, a man lights a flare and holds it aloft. A few men swap grins and chat. The scene draws more Chicagoans from across the street, and more flares illuminate the area with searing light. The armed federal agents struggle to maintain order. Someone's hand blocks our view. A camera flashes over Dillinger's body. Winstead lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene. Policemen help the agents manage pushy photographers. Purvis leaves the scene, silhouetted against the flares' sallow light. Behind him, the glow and the smoke fill the air, blotting the crowd from view. More civilians rush in. From overhead, we gaze down at the chaos, as we withdraw. Winstead sits at a table in a small room with white brick walls. In a cellblock, a matron escorts Billie. Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room, the door opens. Winstead stands as Billie enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his. Winstead sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow. Billie swallows, blinks her glistening eyes, then gives a stony nod. Billie glares coldly. Winstead opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette.",
    "917": "Dillinger wriggles his opened pants downward. Billie, kneeling over him, unfastens her dress. She pulls it off over her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of Dillinger. There are glimpses of Dillinger thrusting into Billie from behind, interspersed with their nuzzling face to face. A recent flashback shows them arriving ecstatically. Another flash shows Dillinger kiss her mouth. His face withdraws down her chest. Later, as they cuddle, they share a warm smile. Later still, Billie strolls in her slip to a window. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. Billie caresses their contents, then rejoins Dillinger in bed. She lays her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck. His thumb gently rubs her graceful jaw line. His gaze pours over her face. He grins. Billie gazes dreamily at him. He gives her another smile. His thumb caresses her cheek in a gentle rhythm. He flashes a puckish grin. At the telephone exchange, Baum stands with a listening piece to his ear and a hand-held mike at his lips. Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb. Purvis drives with Baum at his side. Two other G-men approach the luxury car. One of the street agents looks to his young partner, who bows his hat. Purvis faces Baum. He points, then gets out and faces the young G-man. Purvis leads them across the street towards a building. Inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. Purvis leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun. We watch the agents from afar as they prepare, dwarfing their trench-coated forms. Purvis lifts his knuckles to the door. It opens, revealing a young demure house dressed. Her strawberry blonde hair frames her face in a curly bob. Purvis steps toward the doorway. As he enters, Barton lingers in the hall. At a table, a stout man eats. The baby-faced man nods. She steps away. Returning, the woman shows off her shoes. She holds out the opened wallet as well. Purvis eyes it and gives a nod. Purvis leaves, shutting the door. The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table. Now Purvis and Barton enter a stairwell. Purvis hurries downstairs. Rushing from the building, he runs across the street to agent Baum. In the stairwell, Barton peers through a window in the door. Squinting, he steps into the hallway and lets the door swing shut behind him. From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators. One of them opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features. He steps off and heads for the door.",
    "918": "In the hallway, Barton sees the rugged man behind him, then the stranger stops. Behind Barton, the stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him. The G-man lurches and falls. In the street, Purvis turns. The shooter and his rugged associate leave. Outside, Purvis races toward the building. Baum whips out his gun, then peers at a car parked in the alley. Inside, Purvis enters the hallway and raises his gun. He advances cautiously, then stops, looking down. Glancing quickly ahead, he crouches. Purvis' mouth drops open as he stares downward. On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath Barton. As the wounded man twitches feebly, Purvis watches with a clenched jaw. His expression grows solemn. He glares down the hall, then rises, leaving a lifeless Barton. Outside, Baum sees two men hurrying down the alley steps. The baby-faced shooter raises a Tommy gun. The G-man ducks behind a wall as bullets pepper its surface. Scrambling out, he takes cover behind a garden planter. As the two criminals get into the parked car, Baum pops up and returns fire. The car pulls away. Back indoors, Purvis bursts into the apartment. He ignores the panic and leans out an open window. As the car below exits the alley, Purvis shoots, then hurries out of the apartment. Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building. Purvis stops, staring with his mouth agape. The agent shifts his rueful gaze. With a slow, deliberate stride, Purvis steps closer to his men. Purvis' frustrated gaze scans the agents. His breath puffing visibly in the night air, he steps away. A bank's doors open. Three men in long coats enter. Our gaze drifts up to find Pete between Dillinger and a heavyset thug. The two leaner men split off together. Pete encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter. Without breaking his stride, Dillinger draws a gun in each hand. The bankers all obey. Pete shifts his aim. A banker leads Dillinger to a vault. Now in his office, Hoover talks on the phone. Hoover shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw. In Chicago, Purvis grimly lowers the phone, then shifts his troubled gaze. A locomotive pulls into a station. Puffs of brake steam blast the unfazed travelers and workers on the platform. The heavy wheels slow to a halt. An older, smartly dressed man with wizened features disembarks flanked by two associates. He peers down the platform through beady eyes. The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand. Travelers mill about on the vast terminal's marble floors. The three arriving men pause, taking in their surroundings. Now at a shoeshine stand.",
    "920": "She looks out of a side window as rocks and crags skim past. Daylight falls through holes punched in the fuselage by another burst from the fighter. Bond nurses the stricken aircraft as the hunter swoops in for the kill. He eases the floor throttle forward. Dying engines belch smoke, enveloping the fighter's cockpit. The transport moves to avoid the smoke, trapping the fighter between the larger plane and the rocks. The fighter has to do the same, slowing. The fighter turns to avoid a collision and hurtles straight towards the rocks. He throws her a parachute. A red warning light shows generator failure. She unlatches the outside door for Bond, who gropes for his chute, then hauls on the stick to get out of the plane over the hill. The plane's wing slams into the other aircraft as the two nearly collide. Bond raises the nose, gaining as much height as possible. Cargo strains in its straps, which snaps back towards Camille. Both propellers give out under the strain. Bond drops down the vertical fuselage to Camille. He grabs her, and they tumble out into space. The parachute opens, lets go of her, then dives for her as they continue to fall. M sits stony faced. They land in the sunless steps of the sinkhole. He puts his jacket around her shoulders. He stands, thinks for a moment, and then turns to her. They stare at one another until Bond breaks eye contact. She gives a small nod. He holds out his hand, she takes it and pulls herself up. They trudge through the chilly, rocky shadows. They come to a rockfall. Bond kicks at some of the stones and picks one up. He starts to climb up the rockfall, comes to the top, and pauses, seeing a huge underground lake. They walk down a tunnel with the roof held up by wooden supports. People cluster around. People queue for water and argue amongst themselves. A man climbs up to peer in it, but the well is dry. A standpipe stops dribbling. The bus arrives at the dying town. A small group of people joined by Bond and Camille get on board. The bus's red tail lights shine through the dusty air, covered in dust. Arrive at the Grand Hotel. He heads unhurriedly upstairs, makes his way across the landing, and approaches the door of his room. He pushes it open. He bursts into the bedroom. Fields' body is on the bed covered in black oil. He is frisked and escorted out. Breaks another's knee and lays out the third. He grabs the keys and unlocks his handcuffs, then frisks his would-be captors. As the lift doors open, he cocks the automatic and calmly slips it into the waistband of his trousers in the small of his back.",
    "921": "He flips a dangling leg back into the lift as the doors close and intercepts M. He vaults a balustrade into the balcony above the lobby, avoiding the squads of agents looking for him. Is back past M. She gives a half smile as Bond leaves the building. In a dingy building, two men are carrying a heavy box downstairs. In an office, Felix swigs from a bottle. Felix puffs on his cigar as Bond hangs up. In a rundown part of town, men are drinking, smoking and playing games in a bar. Felix walks in to join Bond who is at the bar. A guy in a leather jacket walks to the bar. A soldier in armor. He sprints upstairs and takes out a waiting soldier with an elbow to the face. Another opens up, sprints off and jumps from one building to another. Felix observes the chaos dispassionately and sips his beer. Beam looks concerned as Felix gets in the car. Bond emerges from the shadows of a balcony onto the rundown street. The sun blazes down on a rocky desert. The general, police chief and guard sit on a cool balcony surveying the arid scene. The general leers after the slim hostess. The police chief wags a knowing finger at him. Behind a rock overlooking the geometrically laid out compound, Camille expertly assembles and loads an automatic. Two cars approach. She stares at him. She looks coldly at him. To an underground entrance. Parties converge along metal walkways and staircases. They arrive at a meeting area surrounded by clear glass panels. There is a display of shiny metallic balls nearby. Green's party arrive, his grim-faced driver carrying two metal attache cases. Greene grins at the general. The hostess brings the general's beer. She removes the beer. A document is placed on the table. Green slides it over to the general with a pen. Camille vaults over the edge of the compound's main building and drops onto the balcony. The general eyes Green grimly and grabs the paper. The second case is placed in front of him. He opens it and examines the wads of bank notes inside. He leaves the table as Green and his men grin smugly. Inside the building, Camille is heading in their direction. She hides in a doorway as the general and his bodyguard. She composes herself. The police chief heads downstairs to his four by four and dumps the money on the backseat. The general's men stand guard at his suite as Green's party head for the car park. Rips her clothes. Camille breathes deeply. Drops onto the police chief's car. He shoots the chief in the head. He clings to the bumper as the driver reverses.",
    "922": "The chief's Land Rover reverses into a wall, which explodes in a fireball. Bond is hurled against a wall and showered with glass. Huddled beneath a car, Bond fires at legs, the only targets he can see. Then he is up and running. He slams a man in a car door, runs to the stairs and takes down Green's driver. Camille shoots the general's guards and kicks one so hard he flies over a railing. The general gets off the hostess. Camille rips off her shirt and stands ready in a stroppy white top as Green bounds up the stairs. He places his German friend as armed guard. Enters the general's room. The hostess, hands bound, runs for the door and is batted aside by Camille who is then attacked by the general. He knocks the gun from her hand and slaps her. Bond runs upstairs. He is aimed at by Green's man just as the compound's main fuel cells erupt, engulfing the meeting area in flames and flying glass. The German is consumed in the fire, but Green runs up the stairs, pursued by Bond. Bond is above Green on the flat glass roof. He fires down and the glass disintegrates. He drops back into the building. Green attacks with a metal bar. Bond drops his gun. Green grabs an ax from a fire point and flails wildly at Bond. The general has Camille by the throat. He pulls off the edge of the floor they are on and dangles in space. Bond, holding him by the hair. Camille struggles desperately under her attacker, grabs his groin and kicks him in the face. She dives for the gun. Camille breathes deeply. Bond hauls Green back up by the hair and dumps him on the floor. Fire falls through the ceiling. Bond runs to her aid. Camille sits crouched in terror, as fire and masonry fall around her. The building is collapsing as Bond tries to reach her. He spots her through the flames, puts his arms around her as the ceiling continues to crack by fire and falling rubble. Bond holds her tightly, spots the gun and picks it up. Her eyes are wide with terror. He is about to kill them. A burst exposes a fuel cell in the wall. The blast takes out the whole side of the building. Green has got clear. Bond watches him go as he and Camille clamber down the rubble. Dragging his injured foot. A plume of dust appears in the barren, empty desert. Bond is behind the wheel of a car. He stops, gets out and flings Green to the ground. Pulls a can of oil from the trunk. Green stares down at the can and at the car as it drives away across the vast, empty.",
    "929": "As Bond walks calmly down the corridor, Greene and his party hurry for an exit. They come face to face. On stage, guns are drawn. The hero is shot on stage as men chase Bond. He runs through a crowded restaurant and shots are fired, taking down a bystander. Bond waits in ambush. A pursuer goes, gun battle ensues in the restaurant. Bond escapes into the kitchen area. A man body checks him, but Bond shoots him pointblank through the dody. He ducks as a door flies open in front of him. He tips over a pan of oil which bursts into flames and gets past the gunman as the hero dies bloodily on stage. He marches the man away with a gun at his neck. He holds the guy at the edge of a roof. Greene gets in his car and Bond's prisoner tries to break free. He sends him off the roof. He lands on Greene's car. Bond straightens his tuxedo. The grim driver gets out and finishes him. In London, an operator is looking at Bond's photos. M stares at her screen. He registers surprise. He walks pensively away from the desk then goes back. He grins and walks off. Bond is in the back of a powerboat flying an Italian flag at the stern. The boat is heading towards a promontory topped by a grand villa overlooking the turquoise blue sea. Bond approaches a stout wooden door. She can't walks off. He drops photos on the table and helps himself to white wine. Bond grins. Mathis looks up at his glamorous younger woman. Bond drains a glass. In a bar on a plane, he looks at a picture of the dead Vespa and picks up a necklace from the bar. He sips a martini. Mathis joins him. He slips the photo into his pocket. They study one another. Bond stays at the bar. Bond and Mathis move through immigration. A redhead in a raincoat stands waiting. They get in the taxi which drives through the busy downtown traffic. They get down from the taxi and Fields strides into a rundown hotel. Bond heading back to the taxi. She obeys, tight-lipped. The statue of an eagle spreads its wings beneath a blue sky dusted with clouds. They are still bickering. They are led through the airy tile and marble halls. Bond casually tosses the keys on a sofa and strides through the spacious, modern furnishings eyed by Fields. She stands looking lost as he casts a critical eye over the bedroom and marble on-suite bathroom. He takes off his jacket and walks into the bathroom. Fields grins, and goes to the bedroom. Bond answers the door naked.",
    "931": "On a page of parchment, the Warner Brothers shield is displayed, followed by the reveal of Warner Brothers Pictures, a Time Warner company. The page turns to a set of interlocking V's, signifying Village Roadshow Pictures. Another page turn reveals L shapes and a set of two broken squares with a small square in the center. A pocket watch on a chain lies on a desk beside typewritten sheets, on top of which rests a magnifying glass. Sitting at the typewriter is a man in his late 30s with dark hair and a neat mustache. A marquee in front of a cathedral erupts in flames, and smoke billows out over bodies on the ground. A man in a frock coat carries a brown paper package under his right arm. As he passes a woman in a wide-sleeved outfit, he transfers the package to her. The pretty, dark-haired woman with a hat perched jauntily on her head is Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes, disguised as an Oriental man, lies on a mattress in the street smoking a pipe. He sits up and grabs handfuls of rice and coffee beans and places them in a bag. Irene strides through the open market. Ahead of her, a man tosses an apple. Irene walks down steps, stops, and twirls. Holmes walks up and takes her arm. He swapped a loaf for the package. He pulls her aside. She glances round at them. She leads him by the hand into an alley. The swarthy man who was tossing the apples steps out in front of them. She takes the package back from him. She leaves him with the loaf. The swarthy man studies Holmes' shabby disguise, then whistles. Holmes removes his spectacles as the three men facing him close in. They slap the bread away and rip off his fake, droopy mustache and ill-fitting wig. He turns. The swarthy man grabs him by the neck and throws him against a fence. Holmes kicks the man, then punches him. He throws rice in one of the thug's face, ducks as another throws a punch and instead hits his colleague. Holmes makes a good account of himself, then is pressed back against the slatted wooden fence and chains are wrapped round his wrists. As the leader closes in with a crate, Holmes spits coffee beans into his face. Holmes manages to duck beneath the crate swung at him and kicks an attacker to the ground. They step back as they see two uniformed policemen on the beat. Holmes slumps to the ground. The swarthy man tosses coins at him. The man does a little skip. The peelers walk away. The man starts to whistle again. Holmes is crouched on the ground, as if in a trance.",
    "932": "Holmes spots a bit of material, a piece of bloodstained wood, a dollop of mortar, and a stain. In his mind's eye, he sees mortar being churned and some spilt. A carpenter cuts his finger, spilling blood. Sacks are used as counterweights and a door handle is disguised as a coat peg. A mechanism turns. The workmen open a bottle of wine and some is spilled, staining the floor. Holmes eyes the coat pegs. He pulls on one of the coat pegs and a secret door opens. Watson draws a sword from a stick and cuts the rope holding the sandbag. The door swings shut behind them. Holmes lights a flaming brand. They look around the secret room and see a printing press and, on a table, sticks of dynamite. Holmes eyes a plaque reading, Imperata. Leading the way with his flaming torch, Holmes heads off down a dark corridor. They go up a flight of stone steps, push a metal grill open and emerge on a dark street beneath a bridge. They climb up onto the bridge and look out towards the opera house. As they get close to the building, they push their way through crowds outside. Inside, the performance is underway. Sim, Holmes, and Watson enter the opera house through the stage door. As they make their way backstage, they don't notice Moriarty's agent lurking in the shadows. He gets up and, puffing on a dark cigarette, watches them go by before heading off in the opposite direction. Holmes, Watson, and Sim walk past stagehands in the wings. A couple of them try to stop them but they ignore the men's protests. Holmes spots a plaque, Imperata, and thinks back to the dynamite beside the one in the secret room. He imagines a bomb with a timing device beneath the stage. Holmes walks over to one of the stagehands and flings him out of the way. He gestures to Sim who tosses him a knife. Holmes climbs under the stage and cuts a hole in a sheet of canvas. He looks up and sees the word Imperata is part of the print on which the statue of Commendatore is standing. Holmes is now inside the plinth. Onstage, the Commendatore points a finger at. Holmes peals away a backing cloth from the word Imperata. Inside the plinth he finds a black chess piece concealed in the O. He picks the chess piece up and sees Moriarty sitting in a box, watching the performance and possibly him, through a pair of opera glasses. Holmes rips his way out of the back of the statue of the Commendatore and hurries across the stage to the wings where Sim and Watson are waiting beside a couple of actors in demon costumes.",
    "933": "He shows Watson the chess piece. In the auditorium, Moriarty watches the performance, apparently spellbound. Holmes, Watson, and Sim hurry into the street and make their way towards the Hotel de Triomphe. The cake containing the bomb is being delivered to the hotel by the rough looking man and his identical accomplice. In a meeting room at the hotel, Meinhard is making a speech. Holmes and the others race towards the hotel. Meinhard turns to look at the cake, which explodes. Out in the street, Holmes and the others see a massive fireball erupt from the hotel. In the opera house, Don Giovanni throws himself at the feet of the Commendatore statue. Moriarty watches, transfixed, as demons surround Don Giovanni. Holmes, Watson, and Sim run into the hotel and survey the carnage. The demons close in around Don Giovanni. The statue sinks into the ground. In the hotel, Holmes finds Meinhard's body and looks at a ring on the little finger of the dead man's left hand. Looking around, Holmes spots a bullet hole in a wall. He pulls a small telescope out of his jacket and, through it, sees another bullet hole in a window nearby. Beyond it, in the distance, there's a statue on top of a building. Later, he, Watson, and Sim are up on the building, beneath the statue. Holmes imagines a rifle. Moriarty's agent is the sniper. He wedges it in an ornate carving. Holmes recalls entering the opera house. Moran loads his Martini action rifle and aims it at Meinhard. He takes his shot. Day, the Eifel Tower. Sim and Watson are sitting at a table outside a cafe at the foot of the tower. Holmes, disguised as an old man, is sitting at a nearby table, listening. Once Moriarty and Moran have gone, he leaps to his feet and dashes off down the back staircase. He pulls off his wig and tosses it to a waiter. Nearly colliding with another waiter, he dons a bellhop's uniform and removes his mustache just in time to intercept Moriarty and Moran in the lobby. Sim takes Watson's hat. She exchanges it for a battered old hat. Holmes eyes the horse uncomfortably. Watson pulls her face. Sim, Watson, and a group of gypsy men ride through the forest. Trailing in their wake comes Holmes, astride a very small pony. The gypsies gallop on through the woods. Holmes bumps along uncomfortably on the pony's saddle. They stop a little way away from a border post. Holmes watches through this telescope as troops stop people crossing. Holmes looks disgruntled at the prospect of more riding. He passes the gypsies as they have a break. The gypsies stare after him as he trots by.",
    "934": "They gallop after him, catching him up. As the gypsies walk the horses along a narrow track, one of them rears up. They look up and see Holmes astride his pony on a higher track above them. They follow him. It's getting dark as they arrive beside a lake. A town sits in the distance across the water. Holmes talks to Watson as they stand beside the horses. Sim, Watson, and Holmes exchange nods, then Holmes and Watson head up. Holmes and Watson crouch low in the darkness as six armed guards march past. All clear, they get to their feet. Holmes pulls a face. Taking the folded-up piece of paper from Holmes, Watson sets off. Holmes crouches and takes another sheet of paper from his pocket. He starts to write. Across the complex, Watson lurks outside the closed telegraph office. He glances around, then kicks the door in. At the munitions factory, Holmes climbs over a barred gate and leaps to the ground. In the telegraph office, Watson pushes open a glass-paned door. Holmes scurries through the munitions factory yard. He hides behind a wooden beam. People walk past the telegraph office. Watson dons a cap. He taps out the message given him by Holmes. Holmes walks along the side of a row of wooden crates. He passes a rack of large, upright mortar shells. He goes to a metal door and opens it. He steps inside, stops and stares. The room contains a number of worktables with machinery. He strolls through it and notices something. He stops by a shell and screws open its tip. He lifts it up. A glass container is attached to the metal tip. It contains a yellow liquid. Holmes sniffs it and puts it down. Holmes continues to wander through the machine room and comes to another metal door with a glass window in it. He peers through it into a command center. An operations tabletop is covered by a map and models on blocks. One is a model machine gun, another a sniper rifle. He sees drawings of a semiautomatic pistol, a revolver, and an automatic light artillery gun. On the wall map, an image of a cannon times 35,500 and an image of a heavy gun times 15,000. Watson leaves the telegraph office and comes down the steps. Holmes enters another room. He closes the door and walks across a balcony towards a metal rail. He leans on the rail and gazes down into the dark interior. In the dim light, he sees row upon row of artillery shells. The lights come on, and he sees the full extent of the number of shells. Holmes turns to Moran and throws down his pistol.",
    "935": "Holmes sees a stack of long-barreled pistols. A man tosses a magazine to Holmes and nods for him to load it. Identical thugs come up behind Holmes. One grabs the gun. The other holds a piece of cloth over Holmes' mouth and nose. His eyes close, and he sinks to the floor. Watson returns to the spot where he left Holmes. He finds a note pinned to a crate and reads it. He turns it over and opens up the folded paper to see Rene's sketch of a tall tower. He glances up at a lit tower nearby, then moves off. A small glass with liquid in it is held under Holmes' nose. He stirs. Watson goes nearer to the tower. Moriarty turns to Holmes. A guard had apprehended Watson. Moran shot the guard to get an aim on Watson. A meat hook is slammed into Holmes' shoulder, and he's hauled up on a rope. Moriarty lowers a stylus on a gramophone record and holds a telephone in front of the horn speaker. The music is broadcast over a speaker into the yard, where Watson cowers in the darkness as Moran keeps a rifle trained from a walkway high up on the tower. Moriarty accompanies the singer. Clutching the rope attached to the hook in his shoulder, Holmes is swinging about a meter off the floor. Moriarty pushes him. Moran shoots at Watson. The bullet ricochets off a metal pole. Moriarty spins Holmes around. Watson breaks cover. Moran shoots and Watson ducks behind a platform. Holmes' screams are audible over the tenor. Watson climbs a ladder on the platform. Holmes spins in the air. Moran takes aim. His shot passes through a narrow gap between pieces of machinery, just missing Watson. Moriarty indicates to a henchman to lower Holmes to the ground. Watson holds his hat up to the gap in the machinery, and Moran puts a bullet straight through it. Watson looks around and sees a pair of ear defenders hanging on the wall. Moriarty rolls his eyes wearily and bends over Holmes, gripping the meat hook embedded in his shoulder with one hand and Holmes' uninjured arm with the other. Moran watches the piece of machinery. A cover falls off it. It's an artillery cannon. Moran retreats. Moran desperately climbs down the tower to escape from the cannon Watson is operating. Watson fires the cannon at the tower. It collapses, smashing through the roof of the building where Holmes and Moriarty are. As the dust settles, Watson sits up on the platform wearing the ear defenders. He climbs down from the platform and runs over to the now ruined building. He searches through the debris and finds Holmes half-buried under the rubble.",
    "938": "Watson pulls out a large splinter of wood from Holmes' foot and examines it, while Holmes drinks the contents of a vial handed to him by Watson. It seems to have no effect at first, but suddenly, Holmes opens his eyes wide and stares around wildly. He leaps to his feet and relaxes a little as Watson examines his foot. Watson smiles wistfully for a moment, then tosses down a medical instrument and looks thoughtful. He exchanges a surprised look with Sim and regards Holmes for a moment before leaning back against the side of a boxcar with a resigned expression. In Switzerland, an imposing castle is perched on a mountainside, saddling a massive waterfall. Watson and Sim join Mycroft for dinner in a snow-covered area. Delegates are arriving at the castle, expanding their backpacks, which tumble hundreds of feet vertically down the mountainside. A horse-drawn sleigh arrives at the castle with Moriarty aboard, who is wearing an elegant figure and top hat and overcoat. He gets out of the sleigh and goes into the castle. The Maitre D' has a book containing photos of all the delegates and identifies and welcomes the new arrival. Moriarty steps forward. In a ballroom, elegant couples in evening wear or military dress uniform dance across the floor. Holmes joins Mycroft, the others, and Watson at the edge of the dance floor. They're all wearing white tie and tails, while Samantha is wearing a deep red dress. Holmes holds his hand out, Sim takes it, and they step onto the dance floor. They and the other couples whirl around in circles across the floor. Holmes looks a bit out of place, his face being unshaven and heavily bruised. He observes the other people in the room, noting details such as a man's hand resting on the hilt of a sword, a woman's necklace, a man's medals, a military man holding a white glass, and an eye-cross spinning to a white uniform. Holmes scans the faces of the people, his eyes settling on the man in a black uniform with a facial scar. He looks thoughtfully at Sim and steers her back over to Watson, gesturing to him. Arm in arm, they take to the dance floor. A man is chloroformed. Watson nods, and Holmes walks over to a footman in 18th Century costume including a white parted wig and handsome letter. The footman nods and takes it. Holmes leaves the ballroom. Watson walks over to Sim and whispers in her ear. She looks surprised. Moriarty chats with a delegate, wearing an orange sash. The footman approaches Moriarty and hands him Holmes' letter. Moriarty reads it and looks around in concern.",
    "946": "A soldier is thrown off the train after an explosion. He steps into a compartment. Holmes looks into the corridor, then shoos an elderly couple out of their compartment. Watson closes the exterior door and sees Holmes lying down. Holmes pulls Watson down beside him and lights a pipe. A soldier opens a crate and takes out a Maxim machine gun, fixing it onto its tripod and loading the belt-fed ammunition into the breech. The weapon is cocked, and the soldier opens fire. Bullets rip through the walls of the first-class compartments, showering Watson and Holmes with debris. Holmes hands Watson a pistol. The lipstick Holmes put in the machine gun belt is fed into the breech, jamming the gun. Watson shoots through the hole created by the machine gun bullets and hits a soldier who drops a grenade. The soldier realizes he's inadvertently pulled the pin out of the grenade, which then drops back into a bag full of grenades. The grenades explode, blasting the train in two. Watson and Holmes sit in the ruined lavatory of their carriage, which is at the end of those still attached to the engine. There is a flashback to her falling from the train. Mycroft appears in a boat. Holmes, whose face is covered in smeared lipstick and eye shadow, waits awkwardly for the answer. Watson smiles ruefully at the mention of Paris. The train rattles on through the night. Black smoke belches from the funnels of a paddle-steamer as it leaves the white cliffs of Dover behind. Watson and Holmes, now out of his disguise, are on the steamer's rear promenade deck. Watson takes Irene's monogrammed handkerchief out of Sims' bag and glances over at Holmes. Holmes takes the hanky and walks over to the railing. He sniffs the hanky, inhaling its scent, as he looks out to sea. Watson watches him closely. Holmes looks down at the hanky, then glances over his shoulder at Watson before casually tossing it over the side. The paddle-steamer approaches the French coast. A flier posted on a wall in Paris advertises a lecture by Professor Moriarty. In a grand building, Moriarty is signing a copy of his book on asteroids for an admirer. He hands it back to the man. As another man comes up to have his book signed, the bearded agent sits beside Moriarty and passes him a note. Moriarty looks at the note then puts it in a leather-covered notebook before signing another book. He turns to his agent as he autographs the book. The agent takes two tickets from his jacket pocket. The agent goes. Outside, he wanders over to a rough-looking bloke leaning against a wall.",
    "947": "Meinhard, a bearded, middle-aged man, gets out of a carriage outside of the Addrelle de Fleuve and heads off. A rough-looking bloke hovers nearby with another identical man, keeping an eye on Meinhard. At a gypsy camp in the countryside, men practice their horse riding skills. Holmes and Watson drive up on the outskirts of the camp in an open carriage. A man comes over to them and holds their horse. Watson calls over to a group of men, then nudges Holmes, who appears to be asleep. The gypsy man indicates a bearded man holding a goose. The gypsies surround Holmes and Watson, who smile politely. The man takes it, then Watson knocks him cold. The atmosphere becomes more strained. A man opens his jacket, revealing a knife. Sim pushes through the crowd, holding her bag which the gypsies have taken off Holmes. The man Watson punched watches them as they eat a meal. Watson looks up from his bowl and frowns. Holmes glares at him. Sim hands the drawings to the gypsy man who passes them to Holmes. Holmes licks the red stain. Holmes turns conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes drinks from a proffered bottle as Watson gets up. Outside, Watson dances energetically with a gypsy. Sim joins in too. Holmes watches and twitches his shoulders in time with the music. At the castle home of Mycroft Holmes, Mary walks into a study and finds him completely naked. She takes it and reads it as Carruthers goes. She takes the telegram and goes. Stanley, the dithering ancient butler, turns around. Paris is under a leaden sky. On a side street, a carriage, with Imperata stenciled on the side, pulls up. The back is opened and a man ushers Sim, Holmes, and Watson from it. They go into a building and pass two men wheeling a coat-of-arms shaped cake on a trolley. The man leads them into a busy kitchen. They make their way past chefs, busy at worktops, until they're stopped and searched by some other man. Holmes notes an empty baking tray and some royal icing in gold leaf laurels together with a shield and a newspaper on a worktop. He, Sim, and Watson are ushered down some stairs. They emerge in a basement room. A man sits at a table with his back to them. The man, Ravache, is eating. Watson sniffs a piece of paper. Holmes and Sim sit. Ravache takes a gulp of red wine and wipes his mouth with a napkin. Ravache sips his wine. Ravache shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his colleagues hear the shot and run off to investigate. Holmes gets to his feet. As Watson fires warning shots up the stairs, Holmes stares into an alcove.",
    "957": "Joe and Alice are in his bedroom. He frantically tries to tidy up, quickly hides an essay with a C minus grade, and looking embarrassed, picks up a model train carriage. In her zombie makeup, Alice suddenly looks up at Joe and he smiles. Charles comes in. Deputy Tally shows Jack a map while Deputy Rosko pauses to tune in his radio. The Air Force is searching the house the kids are filming in front of. Jack drives up and the kids watch uncertainly as Jack takes the camera. Jack puts Joe in the back of his patrol car, goes over to talk to Colonel Nelec, and steps back as the Colonel's expression hardens. The two men shake hands. Later, Joe and Jack return home. With tears in his eyes, Joe glares at his father and Jack glares back at him, struggling to contain his emotions. Jack turns away and marches out of the house, leaving Joe looking bleak. A tear rolls down his cheek and he wipes it away with his hand. At dusk, Joe cycles up a steep hill and goes in through the gates of a cemetery at the top. He cycles on between the headstones, sits silently staring into the distance, and looks down at his mother's locket which he holds in his hand. Hearing a noise, he looks up, gets to his feet, and takes a torch from his rock sack. He shines it on a building nearby and looking through a window, can see earth being tossed about inside the building. Spooked, he runs off. Jack drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field and inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Nelec sits at Woodward's bedside. His face lacerated from the train crash, Woodward glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed. Nelec leans in closer to him. The Colonel gives him a hard stare and walks away from the bedside. His aide, Overmyer, injects toxin into Woodward's drip, and he begins to convulse. Overmyer watches this passionately as Woodward dies. The Colonel stands with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet. Back at home, Joe is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window. He gets up and opens the window to Alice. She climbs in through the window and he takes her hand to help her down off the desk. He tries the light and a Cinay projector starts up. Alice moves forward to watch the film. The footage is of Joe as a baby with his mother. He sucks on her locket as she holds him.",
    "958": "Footage of Joe's first birthday is shown, during which his mother blows out a solitary candle on his cake and picks him up in her arms. Joe is then seen at around three years old, with his mother measuring his height against the wall and kissing a cut on his hand better. The footage changes to Christmas, where Joe's mother smiles as he holds up a present. She picks him up and plays with him in the garden, laughing into the camera. Joe watches this somberly, as does Alice, with unshed tears forming in her eyes. On a distant summer's day, Joe and his mother play together. Joe waves at the camera and looks over at Alice, who is sitting with her back to him, her shoulders heaving and tears rolling down her face. She struggles to find the words as Joe stares at her. The last bit of footage shows Joe's mother pushing him on a swing before the film runs out and spins around on the reel. Joe and Alice then notice rattling noises coming from a strange cube Joe took from the crash site. It vibrates across the tabletop, and Alice wipes tears from her eyes. Joe picks up a pencil and gently prods the cube, which continues vibrating. They exchange a look as the cube shoots off the table and smashes through the wall, leaving a hole in the wall and a poster of the space shuttle that was pinned to it. Joe and Alice peer through the hole, seeing the lights of the tomb and the water tower in the distance. Later, Alice carefully slips her key into her front door and opens it. She steps into the hall, puts the key in a dish on a sideboard, and sees Louis sitting in the front room, smoking and drinking. Wounded, she runs outside, grabs her bicycle, and rides off. Louis comes running after her. Fighting back tears, Alice cycles grimly on, while Louis chases her in the yellow Coupe. She glances nervously over her shoulder as the V8 barrels after her, then rounds a corner and the coupe clips the curb as it takes the corner. Alice jams her brakes on and pulls a u-turn in the road, cycling back past Louis. Taking his eye off the road, he careens into the back of a parked car. Hearing the impact, Alice stops and looks back. As she stares at the wreck, she doesn't notice a massive creature moving behind her.",
    "960": "Jack gets back in the Jeep and, now on a main carriageway, unwittingly motors past Donnie and Joe and the boys who are driving back to town. Donnie takes a sharp right onto a rough track through the trees and, as it's getting dark, they arrive back into town. They drive until Lillian Middle School. The boys leave Donnie in the car park and scramble over a chain link fence. They run to a storage trailer. Joe begins prying a padlock on the trailer with the tire iron. Martin opens it. There are papers and rolls of film inside. They break into a classroom. A photo of him. They look at the footage. Scientists and military men look at the wreckage of something big. Carrie puts a tape in a player. On the film, Woodward is grabbed by a tentacle. Air Force soldiers burst in on the boys. In the car park, Donnie sits in the car smoking a joint, oblivious of the military activity around him. The soldiers march the boys into a corridor. Colonel Nelec approaches them. He finds Carrie's explosives in his rock sack. Nelec eyes Joe. Overmyer finds his mother's locket on him and takes it. The soldiers shepherd the boys onto a bus in the car park. Sitting in his car, Donnie watches as they're driven away. He gets on his CB radio. Still in Air Force uniform, Jack makes his way through the evacuation center. A boy recognizes him. Jack finds Preston reading a magazine. The super eight footage of the alien. On the bus the boys are in, Overmyer hands Colonel Nelec some paperwork. The boys watch anxiously from a holding cell at the rear of the bus. Something hits the side of the bus, jolting it over onto two wheels. It continues along the road a short way like this before righting itself. As it does so, one of its tires blows out. The driver brings the bus to a grinding halt on a remote road. A rifle. Nelec hands the rifle to an apprehensive looking Overmyer. The senior airman driving the bus hesitates before reluctantly obeying the order and opening the door. Outside it's pitch dark. Clutching the rifle, Overmyer cautiously makes his way along the aisle of the bus towards the open door. As he nears the door, Overmyer stops. A tentacle reaches into the bus and grabs Overmyer. The boys watch in horror as it slaps him against the walls of the bus. The rifle goes off hitting the window of the boys holding cell. Overmyer is dragged outside. Martin vomits. The senior airman restarts the bus's engine and it lurches into life. As he stamps on the throttle, the bus is tipped onto its side.",
    "965": "He makes a left turn and pounds through a puddle. At the Adjustment Bureau, an aide hurries up to Thompson. At the courthouse, Adrian greets Elise with a hug. As she steps by, he gazes after her. Meanwhile, David sprints through the downpour reaching the targeted blue door. He ports through and finds himself at a service counter at the New York DMV. A bewildered customer peers at the rainy street left exposed in the open doorway. David races out a lobby door. At the Bureau, Thompson and aides cross a room stocked with hats. Thompson halts, glances at his aides plan book, and rushes off. In the rain, a sprinting David holds a hand out to traffic. He dashes across the street and climbs the courthouse steps two at a time. In the lobby, he crashes into a bystander knocking him down. His hat comes off and a guard approaches. He grabs the hat. Adrian addresses Elise's friend. On her way out, she passes a gaunt stranger in a fedora. A bailiff signals him to take it off, and he does. In the lobby, he races to a metal detector, and wrenches off his jacket and empties his pockets. He slides it along the table as he darts through the checkpoint. Leaving his other belongings, he halts under a rotunda's decorated ceiling. Later he runs up a spiral stairwell. Now as Thompson meets his team in the rotunda, David races past Elise's friend outside the courtroom. He bursts into the Ladies Room. She stares at him. The gaunt bureau officer enters. David coldcocks him. He picks up the officer's plan book, and shows it to Elise. An aide with Thompson consults his book. In the warehouse officers, clad from head to toe in black, get into SUVs. Meanwhile in the Adjustment Bureau. In the courthouse Ladies Room David braces a mop handle behind a radiator barring the door. He checks its sturdiness, then checks the deadbolt. Crossing to her, he puts on the fedora. David opens the closet door and ports them onto Yankee Stadium's grassy outfield. Elise gapes at the abrupt change and setting. David rushes her to a padded doorway in the playing field wall. It ports to a stairway. Climbing it, the couple find themselves in Manhattan's business district. Back in the courthouse Ladies Room, a bureau officer kicks in the door. Thompson and his team enter glancing briefly at their unconscious colleague. Meanwhile, David and Elise race hand in hand down the bustling city street. In the Ladies Room, Thompson notes the plan room lying open on the sink counter. His aide consults his own book. With David, she shakes her head. She nods. Now Thompson and his aide emerge from the underground stairway and arrive in the business district.",
    "967": "She grips two high heels, a coat, and an open champagne bottle which she sets on the counter. Her unblinking eyes stay on him. The woman sits on the counter. David straightens, his gaze fascinated. As David faintly nods, the smiling woman shakes her head. Their amused smiles relax as their stare lingers. David breaks the gaze. The two strangers gaze at each other, and then converge abruptly in a deep kiss, caressing each other passionately. As their kiss ends, their faces still hover close. A second onrush of kissing overtakes them. The woman jogs out barefoot. Charlie smiles. David follows her. She peers back. Two men approach. She loosens his tie. She hurries off. Now in the ballroom. Backstage Charlie and other aides applaud. David peers at his supporters, then briefly bows his head. He glances back stage. He holds up a shoe. Numerous flashbulbs pop. Now dark clouds drift over Manhattan. On a pleasant city street, largely devoid of activity. A shiny black town car stops by Madison Square Park. A rear passenger door opens. The oldest member of the mysterious four-man team from the rooftop gets out of the car in his fedora and overcoat. He confidently enters the park. Farther along, the mustached stranger sits on a bench. The older superior sits beside him. His superior walks away. The mustached subordinate peers after his boss with a faint smile. Across from the park, a well-kept residential building shows beyond a few trees. Inside David sleeps. He wakes and turns off his alarm clock, which reads six o'clock. Later, David sips coffee. Later, David carries a to-go cup of coffee as he crosses a park. As David and his fan go their separate ways, the mustached stranger remains on his park bench, his head bowed and his fedora brim tilted to shade his face. David hurries across a street. A clock on the side of a building reads 7.05. Sunlight glows through a tree's branches, bathing the stranger's face. He awakes. Blinking, he glances around, then pulls out his hardcover book and checks a bookmarked page. He jumps to his feet, spotting David, who boards a bus. The stranger races after it. David notices him through a bus window. The stranger keeps sprinting, as David looks for a place to sit. He smiles. The lovely woman from the election night sleeps with her head leaned against a window. As David takes the seat beside her, she stirs. David checks out her thighs and miniskirt. She notices him and beams. Outside, the mustached stranger still sprints after the bus. She stares at him. David grabs his phone. A car speeds past the running stranger. The bus pulls up to a stop.",
    "97": "A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, recuperating. Forrest turns the TV off and is hit on the back of the head by a ping-pong ball. He shakes his head. The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. They step toward the ping-pong table. The player holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest keeps his eyes on the ball. The player tosses the ball onto the table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back. He hits ping-pong balls, which land in a bedpan on a chair. A group of wounded soldiers sits and watches Forrest play by himself. He hits two balls at a time against the opposite side of the table. Meanwhile, Lt. Dan stares out the window. Later, Forrest lies in his bed asleep. A hand reaches and grabs him. Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor and holds him down. Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go, and rolls. He sits up as Forrest looks at him. Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An officer walks up to him, holding up an envelope. Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed and stops mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest turns and looks at the nurse. The television shows Forrest being awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson. Color footage reveals President Johnson placing the award around Forrest's neck and shaking hands. The president leans and whispers into Forrest's ear. The television then shows Forrest dropping his pants, bending over, and showing the bullet wound on his bare buttocks. President Johnson looks down and smiles. Three men in a barbershop and Mrs. Gump look up in disbelief and shock, respectively. Hilary leads a line of vets toward a large anti-Vietnam War rally and pulls Forrest onto the stage. The other vets follow, pushing Forrest toward the microphones. Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly. Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman sneaks over to the audio circuit board and pulls the patch cords out. Forrest continues to speak into the microphone, but no one can hear him. Hilary notices the policeman, rushes over, pushes the policeman away, and grabs his nightstick. Another protester pulls the policeman away. Isabel, Hilary, and another protester try to plug the tangled mess of wires back into the audio board.",
    "970": "David averts his gaze, his lips parted, then shifts his eyes and shrugs. Charlie glances away before eyeing David, who presses his lips in a disappointed line. Our view hovers above a stately, high-ceilinged reading room with a center aisle separating dozens of large tables arranged perpendicularly to it. The mustached adjustment officer sits at one table with his hands folded, surrounded by men quietly working at other tables, some writing in slim books. He shifts his contemplative eyes, then rises and walks down the aisle. Rain falls on the sidewalk in front of a ragtag neighborhood bar, where David sits inside, writing multiple iterations of Elise's phone number on a napkin. The mustached officer sits beside him. David glances down, then shifts his jaw to glare indignantly at Harry. Harry glances skyward, then over his shoulder, and lays the ticket on the bar. As Harry stands, David takes the ticket. Harry dons his newsboy cap and leaves. David stares contemplatively at the ticket. On a ferry, passengers ride inside a covered seating area, and a couple at the handrail gazes out at the city skyline. David finds Harry leaning against the railing at the boat's stern and gives a nod, then gazes at the city. David heads down a crowded sidewalk and, as he walks amid the flowing pedestrians, the screen fades to black. David lies on his back in bed, gazing out a window with a faraway look, his face bathed in sunlight as he rests his hands on his stomach. He shifts his gaze to the clock on his bedside table, reaches over, and turns off the alarm, then drops his head back on the pillow, his chest heaving. Our view sweeps down the front of his towering apartment building as David exits, briefcase in hand, and starts down the sidewalk. In Madison Square Park, dead leaves litter the ground as David makes his way across and waits at his bus stop. An M6 pulls up, and he climbs aboard, sliding his pass through the reader and pausing in the aisle. His hopeful eyes find the empty pair of seats occupied three years earlier by Elise, and he heads to them and sits. The bus pulls away from the curb as sunlight yawns across the side of a high-rise. David gazes out his window at a passing scaffold creating a canopied sidewalk by a construction site, and a short distance ahead, he notices a dark-haired woman striding down the sidewalk. As the bus cruises past, he sees that it's Elise. Elise turns down a street behind the bus as it pulls over. David hurries off and races back up the sidewalk after her.",
    "973": "Inside, he crosses a huge marble lobby striped with shadows, then plods up a dark staircase. Later, he stands before double doors marked Mr. Donaldson. As he goes to knock, the clean-cut Donaldson steps out. They enter a wood paneled room through a door framed in green marble. The wall suggests an octagonal perimeter. They enter a records archive and stop by a reference desk. The balding Burdensky opens a volume. On the opened historical pages, the circuit light pathways are unchanging. Meanwhile, David and Elise walk together. As they stroll through a park in the early evening, Elise throws her head back and laughs. Now, in the Adjustment Bureau reading room, Richardson finds Harry studying at one of the large tables. Back in the records room. With David and Elise, he runs. He easily stays ahead, running backward. She gut-punches him and runs ahead. She wins. Now ravers dance under bright flashing lights in a warehouse. David and Elise enter. David waves at partygoers. Elise loosens, then removes it. Later at a table, David swigs from a beer bottle. He shakes a guy's hand. As David and Elise talk, their faces close together, David grins. Elise jumps up and down, pumping her hands round his head. The ravers cheer as David dances with Elise. Later, she hugs him. Now they leave the party. Elise watches him with sorrowful eyes. He twitches a tender smile. He glances away and Elise gently rests a hand on his jacket lapel. As he gives her a sheepish grin, she reaches up to his face and strokes his cheek. Wrapping an arm around his shoulders, she leans forward and presses her lips to his. David returns the kiss, enveloping Elise in his arms. Later, in Elise's bedroom, David runs his fingers through her hair. She rests her hands on his bare back and he clasps her face as he kisses her passionately. Now he rolls on top of her in bed, his lips still pressed to hers. As they make love, he grips her hand and their fingers intertwine. David nuzzles Elise's chest. She runs a hand up the back of his neck, and he lifts his head briefly. Later, he spoons her as they sleep, his arm draped over her body. A withdrawing view of them reveals a suited man in a fedora, standing at the foot of the bed. With steely eyes, he watches the couple sleep, then turns away. Sunlight seeps between clouds and fills the sky. Elise sleeps alone in bed, the sheets beside her pushed down and rumpled. She jerks awake. Her startled look becomes relieved, and she touches her fingers to her brow. She notices the vacant spot beside her and sits up.",
    "974": "She glances around. She frowns to herself, her lips parted. She answers her cell. The front door opens, and David enters. She waves at David. She nods at the phone. David hands her a cup of coffee. David fixes his coffee in the kitchen of the one-room flat. She hangs up. Her phone shows four missed calls from Adrian. David looks up, knowingly. His thoughtful gaze drifts. She glances aside. Her lips spread into a sad smile. David blinks. He moves to a chair at her bedside. She meets David's gaze. Swallowing hard, Elise averts her eyes. As she looks at him again, she smiles wistfully. David gives her a contented look. Her eyes glimmer with tears as she meets his gaze. David crooks a smile. Elise's smile fades as she stares into David's earnest eyes. They gaze tenderly at each other. Blinking, David looks away. He juts out his jaw, then locks eyes with her. Now Elise sits in a green room. In the studio, David shakes Jon Stewart's hand, then waves to the audience. Meanwhile, a guy in a ball cap enters the green room. Her shoulders sag as the man leaves, and she collects her belongings. Now as David leaves the studio, the man in the ball cap opens the door for him. David texts as he walks through the doorway. Lifting his gaze from his phone, he finds himself in the Adjustment Bureau warehouse. He whips around to the closed door, but finds it locked. He tries another one, then attempts to lift a loading bay door. Now David sits with his back against a support beam. As he stares off, a figure appears. The steely-eyed adjustment officer approaches. Rising, David stares at him. David looks Thompson in the eyes. Thompson paces away from him. David follows. David observes Thompson, who stands still, his thoughtful eyes blinking. He shifts his gaze to a bay door and it begins to rise. With a determined look, David hurries past Thompson to the exit. The adjustment officer blinks his disapproving eyes. Meanwhile at Cedar Lake, dancers perform on one section of a low, L-shaped stage. As they twirl gracefully, male dancers leap across the other section, then drop to their knees and spin. David rides in the back of a cab, his eyes shifting to his window as the city's glimmering lights glide past. The taxi slows in front of Cedar Lake. Now David enters the dance studio. He joins a group of patrons who stand near a tiered section of stage. Elise sits on the top platform, her feet resting on a bench below it. As she hunches forward, a group of dancers gathered behind her lifts her into the air.",
    "977": "As Benjamin passes his room's door, the old man calls out to him. There is grainy footage of him getting zapped. Benjamin stares at doors, looking around thoughtfully, then walks on up the corridor. He stops outside the door to his room and stands looking pensive. It's dark as Benjamin walks up outside Thomas's house and knocks on the door. A servant walks to the front door, pulling up his braces, then opens the door and directs Benjamin up the stairs. Benjamin opens the door of Thomas's room and goes inside. Thomas is asleep in bed. Benjamin gently shakes him. As the very first rays of dawn light creep across the sky, Thomas's car pulls up outside the country house. The chauffeur and Benjamin get out of the car. As Benjamin walks around the vehicle, the chauffeur helps Thomas out of the car. With the sky tinged orange, Benjamin wheels Thomas along in a wheelchair. They come to a halt. The chauffeur waits in the car and pulls his cap over his eyes. In front of the lake house, Benjamin lifts Thomas out of the wheelchair and carries him over his shoulders down to a jetty which leads out into the waters of the vast lake. He carefully sets Thomas down and lowers him onto a wooden seat. Benjamin pats Thomas on the shoulder and takes a seat behind his father. Thomas sits looking out across the expanse of water towards the dawn on the far horizon. He nods to himself as he takes in the view. Thomas closes his eyes and sighs. He and Benjamin are silhouetted against the rising sun. An assortment of buttons is swept off a table into a jar. Thomas lies dead on a table. An undertaker places the jar of buttons on Thomas's stomach. Benjamin and an elderly Queenie visit him as he lies in an open casket in an ornate chapel at rest. He holds out his arm. She takes it. The exterior of the majestic theater on Broadway, a yellow cab pulls up outside the theater. Benjamin gets out clutching a bunch of flowers. He pays the cab driver and goes into the theater. Benjamin steps into the darkened auditorium. On stage, a woman in a headdress is lifted up by two men who exit stage right. Certain beautiful with a long platted ponytail, Daisy takes to the stage with her dance partner. Benjamin watches as the man raises her aloft like the thicker head of a ship against the painted backdrop of a stormy ocean. Benjamin, no longer wearing spectacles, takes a seat and stares fixedly at them as the dancer turns gracefully with Daisy reclining in his arms. The spotlights shift to follow their movements as they prance left and right.",
    "980": "He stares at her for a moment then lets go of the screen door and purposefully walks across the porch to embrace her. She flings her arms around him with a big smile. They sit indoors. She leaves. Daisy leans across the dining table. Benjamin carries two of Daisy's suitcases as they walk side by side through the silent shadowy corridors of the home. They enter a bedroom decorated with framed landscape paintings. Daisy puts her coat and hand back down on the double bed which has tall elaborately-carved bedposts. She closes the door and turns around. Their eyes meet across the dimly-lit room. Stepped closer and Benjamin firmly clasps her torso. Daisy arches her back slightly as their lips meet in a slow kiss. Benjamin unfastens her belt then unzips the back of her dress. She carefully rolls down her stocking, revealing a scar beneath her right knee. He slides off her dress and kisses the back of her neck. Her hand meets his as he grasps her right thigh. She turns to kiss him. Her long sleek red hair draped over one shoulder. Benjamin pulls his sweater off and climbs onto the bed as Daisy reclines, wearing a sultry black slip. A clock ticked from Queenie's old dresser. Benjamin and Daisy are silhouetted against the lilac sunset on the slowly drifting boat, the Bottomup. Benjamin looks up to see a space rocket rise over billowing mountainous clouds on the horizon. Daisy wrings out her wet hair. Benjamin playfully engulfs her in a stripy towel. They lounged together beneath palm trees on golden sands. Standing beside her on the ocean, Benjamin watches Daisy as she raises her head from the still waters. Night, they make love on the deck. They dive off the prowl of the boat as moonlight plays on the glittering surface of the sea. They swim gracefully beneath a brilliant full moon. They remained seated at the picnic branch as people flee from an advancing storm. They lie on the floor close to bed. He lies face down with his eyes closed. Daisy rests her chin against his shoulder. Lightning flashes. The wind rattles the windows. The doors rattle in the gale. Pale diaphanous drapes and close them in their bed. Daisy rolls onto her side and smiles as she gazes at him. He props himself up and looks at her. She strokes his cheek. He smiles. He inches closer. They kiss. A ceiling fan turns beneath the slipping raft over their bed. In the hospital, Caroline stares down at the diary. Looking tanned and healthy, Benjamin and Daisy carry luggage up the front steps of the retirement home. Benjamin enters ahead of Daisy to find it deserted.",
    "983": "Now a toddler, Caroline sleeps beside Daisy, who wakes up watched by Benjamin. They sit with Caroline in a park, where she plays with a toy caterpillar while Daisy stares at Benjamin. Balloons decorate the dining room of their duplex as parents sit at the table with their children. Benjamin goes to the kitchen and looks back into the dining room, where Daisy sits with little Caroline on her knee. A decorative figure of a little girl adorns the remains of a pretty, white birthday cake. The guests have departed, and Daisy washes up in the kitchen. She watches Benjamin through a Venetian blind as he sits on a wall outside with Caroline in his lap. Caroline lets go of a yellow helium balloon, and it floats away into the sky. Daisy smiles. Benjamin watches Caroline sleeping in her cot, takes a bulging envelope from the old dresser drawer and a savings book from a small box, and puts them on top of the dresser with a house key. Daisy lies in bed, watching him, and they share a long look before Benjamin retreats into the shadows and leaves the room. Daisy sits up in bed as he heads for the front door, throws back the bed covers, and sits on the edge of the bed as Benjamin, zipping up his jacket, goes to his motorcycle in the cold, blue light of dawn and rides away. Caroline sits in the corner, turning a page of the diary to find a number of postcards bound with an elastic band. She removes it and reads the back of one as sallow-skinned Daisy watches from the bed. Caroline flips another postcard over and reads it, Daisy listens, closes her eyes, and Caroline unfolds a letter. Benjamin backpacks through India, where locals wash in a river. He wakes in a sleeping bag, looks out over a beautiful, desolate landscape, and mends his motorbike. Now a young man, he carries groceries down a street. A dying Daisy frowns. 50-something Daisy crosses her dance studio, little girls file through a windowed office as Daisy puts an arm into one sleeve of her coat. She switches off the studio lights as parents usher their children out of the building, then finishes putting her coat on as she starts across the darkened foyer. A figure stands by the door and steps forward. His mid-length hair is a sun-kissed blond, his build is slighter and his skin smoother. He shrugs. Caroline's 12. Daisy hangs her head, and they shake hands. A gray-haired man enters. Robert looks confused, looks at Daisy, who's fighting back tears, then strokes Caroline's hair.",
    "984": "Robert and Caroline stroll to the back while Daisy goes to the front doors. They gaze at each other as a smile plays on Benjamin's lips. Daisy frowns and strides past him to the windowed office. She turns to him and closes the door. Benjamin follows Daisy through a bright corridor to the back entrance. Outside, they share a look. Daisy turns and strolls to Robert's beige SUV. Benjamin watches as she gets in. Her eyes remain fixed on Benjamin as Robert reverses onto the road. Benjamin stands beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights. He watches as the vehicle drives away. A strong wind buffets the hospital. Caroline returns to the diary. Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy. She lowers her eyes as she steps over the threshold. Benjamin closes the door of room 325. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room. She nods. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek. He tenderly massages her left shoulder. He draws her closer, and they hold each other tightly. He looks her in the eye and gently slides her coat off her shoulders. A TV set. Wearing only a bra and knickers, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed. He watches as she pulls her black leotard on. She puts her coat on and turns to face him. He looks at her with an air of sadness as she strolls to his hotel room door. He leans on the windowsill as she walks to a taxi. Daisy gets into a yellow taxi outside her large, white house. The cab pulls away. Now in her late 60s, Daisy addresses the cab driver. The taxi approaches the stately, white-clapboard edifice of the retirement home. An elderly black man sits at a table in the courtyard, sketching. Wrapped in a shawl, Daisy ambles up nearby. She smiles weakly as she looks around. Daisy enters the building via the back door. Queenie's daughter beckons Daisy into the room. A bearded man with a name tag rises. He gives her the diary. Daisy looks down, then turns on hearing a piano. She walks into the communal living area, where a figure is hunched over the keyboard of the piano. David and Queenie's daughter hover as Daisy approaches the figure. He turns and stares vacantly. He's a child of about 12. She reaches out, but Benjamin recoils. He turns and looks at her. He has cropped, sandy hair and acne. Daisy blinks and takes a slow, inward breath. She takes a seat beside him, and he narrows his eyes. She shakes her head. She was drying his hair with a towel. Little Benjamin stands on the high, gray-slate rooftop.",
    "987": "Benjamin plants his hands on the armrests of his chair and labors determinedly to stand up, frowning. He adjusts his leg with his hands and stands, then collapses. The preacher points both hands at Benjamin, and he struggles to his feet, standing shakily before the congregation with crooked posture. He takes a step, and the congregation claps and cheers him on. The preacher freezes with his arms held aloft as two concerned men rise sharply, and the preacher keels over. A white-robed pianist starts to play while the flag outside flies at half-mast. Music plays from a gramophone beside a grave where Benjamin, Queenie, and Tizzy are amongst the mourners. As the song ends, a man, an old guy, claps two cymbals together. Benjamin eavesdrops on a conversation and hobbles on crutches to the back door to watch Mr. Oti holding court in the garden. Mr. Oti turns to see Benjamin, who ducks out of sight. Indoors, diminutive, sharp-suited Mr. Oti takes a seat beside Benjamin, who turns gingerly to meet his gaze. The black African, Mr. Oti, smiles. Outside, on the sunny street, Mr. Oti tips his hat to one of three children playing baseball. Wearing a large, ill-fitting fedora, Benjamin struggles to keep up with him on crutches. Mr. Oti waves to a tram. On board, Bushman shares a cage with apes and bares his teeth at three children in the whites-only section of the tram. They cower. Benjamin and Mr. Oti sit on a bench by tall stone columns. Benjamin presses his lips together and looks away, thoughtfully, then smiles at Mr. Oti before looking away again. Benjamin sips root beer as they approach a woman in town. Oti hugs her, and dwarfed by Philomena, Mr. Oti walks away. Alone, Benjamin fails to reach a tram in time and waves a crutch in the air as the tram glides off. He cuts a forlorn figure as he plods away. At night, Benjamin determinedly makes his way down a sidewalk. As he arrives at the familiar clapboard retirement home, Queenie lifts a sash window and stares down at him. At a basin, she goes, and he stares at his wet, blistered hands. On the lawn, Benjamin turns to see a man watching him from the street. The man, his father, Thomas, gets into the back of a car. An elegant, gray-haired woman watches as the girl pirouettes. Benjamin sits with Oti, Philomena, Miss Fuller, and Daisy. Queenie takes Tizzy's hand, and Miss Fuller reads to Daisy from an illustrated storybook. Benjamin sits with them. At night, age six, with long red hair, Daisy approaches Benjamin's bed. He sits up, and she beckons him. Benjamin hobbles down a flight of stairs in the dark. Table linen has been thrown over some tables and chairs to form a tent.",
    "988": "Daisy crawls into the makeshift den, and Benjamin follows on his hands and knees. Kneeling beneath the table, Benjamin strikes a match and carefully lights a candle, whose warm glow silhouettes them behind the white drapery. Daisy smiles and gingerly reaches out to touch his smiling face. Benjamin holds her gaze as she touches his stubbly cheek. Miss Fuller whisks up the sheet, exposing them. Daisy obeys. Miss Fuller scowls at Benjamin. Wearing a nightgown, she starts up the stairs, using her cane. Dejected, Benjamin leans out of the den with his head hung. Queenie comes up from the basement in her dressing gown and catches sight of him kneeling in the shadows, staring at the floor. Suddenly resolute, Benjamin rises, resting on his cane. She embraces him, gently strokes his back, and kisses him on the forehead. She scratches her head thoughtfully as he walks away. Benjamin hooks his cane on the end of his bed and gets in. Old man Daws is in the bed opposite. Grainy old footage of the lightning striking him. Sepia footage of Mr. Daws collapsing by a mailbox. Lying in his bed, Daws exhales a cloud of wispy, white cigarette smoke and stares off in thought. Benjamin turns onto his side and sinks down beneath the covers. Smiling, Oti takes a step back, then turns and walks briskly out of the door. Straight-backed and without the use of a cane, Benjamin goes to a window and peers out through narrowed eyes. Carrying a suitcase, Oti crosses the road below, bathed in the orange glow of a streetlamp. A woman with a dog. He sits beside her at a piano. He joins in. They play together. Benjamin washes himself in the bath. He stares down. Caroline leaves Daisy's bedside. On TV, Hurricane Katrina. A nurse arrives. They stand by a window at the foot of the bed. The nurse strides off to assist a colleague, and Caroline drifts over to the empty bed beside her mother's. Cast in cold, blue light from the window, she takes her hands out of the pockets of her dark body-warmer and sits cross-legged on the mattress with the diary in her lap. Mr. Daws sits beside him on a bench. Grainy footage. Lightning strikes Mr. Daws in a field, sending up a plume of smoke. A man approaches them on the dock. The captain glances around. Benjamin looks at a young guy. Benjamin stands up. The bearded captain wears braces and a peaked cap. He nods. Benjamin boards the tugboat Chelsea. The captain leans out of the wheelhouse. He swabs the decks. In the wheelhouse, Mike leans towards Benjamin. Mike squints thoughtfully. Benjamin wears a searching expression.",
    "990": "At the graveside, Benjamin turns to Mrs. Maple's dog as Daisy watches him say his goodbyes. Tizzy shakes hands with Benjamin and Queenie hugs him. Red-haired Daisy watches as he heads off. Carrying a kit bag and a suitcase, Benjamin, who now looks in his late 60s, walks along the sidewalk and gets to the end of the road. He stops and sees Daisy running after him, but she turns and runs back down the street. Benjamin carries on up the road. In the hospital, Caroline opens a box full of old postcards tied up with ribbon. Daisy does a pirouette. Captain Mike and Benjamin are on the snow-covered deck as Mike points to a tattoo on his chest and makes a figure of eight with his hand. The twins start to fight. In an elevator, Benjamin now looks in his 50s. He follows them out of the lift. Back on the snow-covered deck of the tugboat, the tug is towing a gigantic ship. Benjamin lies in bed in the hotel. He finds Elizabeth in the lobby of the hotel, sitting on a sofa, a dressing gown over her nightdress, reading. Benjamin is in his dressing gown and heads towards the kitchen, then turns back to her. He goes through to the kitchen. Elizabeth stares after him and closes the magazine she was reading. She gets to her feet and peers into the kitchen, where Benjamin is busy making the tea. She walks into the kitchen and Benjamin looks up. Elizabeth opens her mouth, as if about to say something. Benjamin goes over to her worktop and picks up two Russian tea glasses and their holders. He puts the fly-ridden honey pot down and carries the tea glasses and the teapot over to a table. Elizabeth takes a seat as Benjamin pours the tea. He sits down, and they eye each other across the table. Elizabeth wags her forefinger. Benjamin checks on the teapot. Elizabeth looks a little awkward as he pours her a cup. She sips her tea and looks thoughtful. They share a smile and sip their tea. They both smile. Heavy snow falls over the tugboat. Benjamin comes downstairs. Elizabeth gets up to greet him. Mr. Oti, Queenie, Tizzy, and Daisy sleep soundly. Elizabeth turns to Benjamin and looks a little flustered and heads off. In the hospital, at the ballet school, young Daisy reads Benjamin's card. Looking sad, she dances with other students in front of a panel of judges. At night in the hotel, Benjamin comes downstairs into the lobby and finds Elizabeth wearing an evening dress. They sit at a table in the hotel dining room. Benjamin tentatively tries a spoonful of caviar.",
    "991": "They sip their vodkas. Elizabeth takes another spoonful of caviar. They each take another swig of vodka. A reporter interviews her on the beach. Benjamin takes her hand, and she responds. He stares at her through his round spectacles. She looks up at him and touches his face. She smiles. They lean together and share a kiss. She gets up from the table and walks away. Wearing a suit, Benjamin takes the lift down to the hotel lobby. Outside, they open champagne. They walk through the deserted, snowy streets. They walk arm in arm, the streetlights dimly illuminating their way. Benjamin shivers. In the hotel, Benjamin takes a room key off a hook behind reception. He gets in the lift with Elizabeth and closes the doors. The lift rises. Elizabeth wears a fur coat and a hat with a broad brim, which casts her face in shadow. They gaze at each other. They arrive outside room 57, and he unlocks the door. He holds it open and turns to Elizabeth. She falls into his arms, and they disappear into the room. Caroline smiles and keeps reading. Returning from work, Benjamin gets in the lift at the hotel. Elizabeth's po-faced husband is the only other occupant. Benjamin avoids his gaze as the lift rises. Evening, he and Elizabeth go to room 57. Elizabeth kisses him twice as they leave the room. She starts to walk away down the corridor. She looks back. She smiles and goes. He comes downstairs and finds the lobby deserted. He finds the dining room and the kitchen deserted, too. He looks over at the bar, then takes a seat by the fire in the lobby. As the night wears on, Benjamin drifts off to sleep. When he wakes, people are milling around the lobby. Looking awkward, Mr. Mayes heads out of the bar, past Benjamin. Captain Mike swigs from a coffee cup. Benjamin unlocks his door and finds a note has been pushed under it. Night, on board the tugboat. Benjamin, who'd just thrown a bucket of water over the side of the ship, goes below decks. Benjamin lies on his bed, reading a magazine. One of the other sailors, Pleasant, calls down from his top bunk. He hands Benjamin a big roll of notes. Pleasant lies back out of Benjamin's sight. Up on deck, Benjamin and the other crew members walk towards the prow of the tug, passing Mike, who's ringing the alarm bell. They look out into the night. Up ahead of them, they see several burning ships on the dark horizon. Pleasant runs up to a search light mounted by the wheel house. Dead bodies drift in the dark waters. In the wheelhouse, the wheelman kills the engines.",
    "992": "The tug drifts as, somewhere ahead, a U-boat surfaces in the darkness. Pleasant bangs on the wheelhouse window, and the tug restarts its engines, sending a plume of black smoke out of its funnel. Mike and Benjamin peer over the side and spot the U-boat's conning tower. The U-boat surfaces fully, and the tug's lights become visible on the horizon. Someone hurries into the wheelhouse, causing the wheelman to stare. Mike hands the wheelman a pistol. A crew member mans a heavy machine gun on top of the tug, and a gunner climbs into the U-boat's conning tower. Benjamin has a life jacket, which he gives to one of the twins. Lights are turned off on the tug, and Vic makes the sign of the cross. Manning the heavy machine gun, Danny Smith cocks the weapon. The wheelman aims his pistol at the U-boat. Captain Mike grits his teeth, then sets the engines full ahead and steams towards the U-boat. The German gunner spots the tug approaching and opens fire with a machine gun. Benjamin ducks, and Danny returns fire. Mike flinches as the German rounds shatter the windows. Manning the searchlight, Pleasant catches a bullet and collapses. Benjamin cowers on the deck below the wheelhouse. Danny Smith is hit and falls from the machine gun. Mike also takes a hit and collapses. Vic crosses himself again as the tugboat plows forward and smashes into the side of the U-boat. The U-boat explodes beneath the tug. Both vessels take on water and begin to sink. Benjamin staggers into the wheelhouse and, in the darkness, finds Mike on the floor. He props him up, and Mike screams in pain. Mike tears his jumper, revealing two bullet holes in his chest. Benjamin takes the captain's blood-soaked hand in his. Mike dies, and Benjamin stares down at him. Benjamin, his face stained with blood, stares at his lifeless skipper. Vic cradles his dead twin. A door swings open on the tug, which is listing badly in the water. As the dawn breaks, the tug and the U-boat have sunk below the waves. A fleet of other ships are now at the scene. Watched by a grieving Vic, Benjamin tosses a life belt from The Chelsea over the side of the rescue vessel. As it floats in the water, a hummingbird flies past it. The bird flies up and hovers briefly in front of Benjamin, then flies off. The sun shines down out of a clear, blue sky. Benjamin, who now looks about 50, with shorter hair and new specs, wanders into the retirement home. She looks around and sees him. She takes a few seconds to recognize him. He looks down. Benjamin plays the piano.",
    "993": "At night, a green light pulses through a mist at the edge of a body of water as snowflakes drift through the dark sky. Beyond is a stately Victorian building where the narrator, Nick Carraway, is with a doctor. The doctor sits, listening, while Nick sits with his head resting on his hands, then goes to a window and paces around the room with a weary frown. The streets of New York are crowded with people, and frantic traders on Wall Street are amidst piling money, dancing girls, and illicit booze being bottled. A red biplane does a corkscrew dive above a skyscraper as a younger Nick looks up from the busy street, smiling. At work, Nick is on the phone, and a girl beckons from the beach near a spectacular mansion with an ornate garden where men play polo on the lawn. In his trophy room, Tom hurls a football at Nick and charges at him, barging him through double doors into a large salon with billowing drapes and a crystal chandelier, where a young woman cavorts on a couch before servants close the doors. She rises and pulls Nick over the couch, where another young woman sits with her. Nick turns to Daisy as Tom glowers at her and Henri gestures towards the doors, which are all opened by servants. Later, dinner is served at a long table on the terrace, but Daisy's smile fades at the sound of a telephone, her eyes darting nervously. Handsome Tom goes into the salon with Daisy following. Nick smiles at Jordan as Henri opens the doors for Daisy and Tom to return, Daisy closing her eyes despairingly. They stop by rose bushes, Daisy glancing tearfully at Tom before gazing wistfully into the distance towards West Egg and Gatsby's mansion. In the dark, a man walks towards the end of a long dock as Nick drives along a lane, parks his car, and walks closer to the suited man standing by railings, slowly raising his right hand towards the pulsing green beacon across the water. In the sanitarium, Nick stands at the window, tapping the frosted glass as snow continues to fall outside.",
    "1001": "A secret door opens and they walk through the sliding door which has the barber's price list on it. Wolfsheim leads Gatsby and Nick into a busy speakeasy with arched ceilings where girls in tasseled bikinis and feather headdresses dance on a stage and a line of barmen flamboyantly makes cocktails. A cop throws a man out as Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers. Gatsby and Wolfsheim study Nick who sits between them looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks and Gatsby goes. Wolfsheim leans closer, his tie pin a jeweled tooth. They look up at Gatsby. Wolfsheim swaggers away and, unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile. Nick looks around and the city's aglow with neon lights. Nick goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant and frowns. In a flashback, Jordan practices golf on Daisy's lawn and, in battle, Gatsby leads a charge. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street, get a cab, and ride in the cab. A bright moon hangs in the night sky as the cab drives along the tree-lined lane. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane. Nick sees Gatsby and frowns as the cab rolls up and Nick gets out. The cab drives off and Gatsby stands bathed in light. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion. They both smile, slightly awkwardly, and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back and looks around edgily. Nick smiles openly and Gatsby nods, looking slightly at a loss. Gatsby turns and walks away as Nick looks curious. A bright sunny morning reveals a stone birdbath cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers. Nick comes out of his cottage, in his dressing gown, to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden. A path of paving slabs is laid, hedges are trimmed, and flowers are arranged in beds. Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand. It's pouring with rain as, wearing a white suit, Gatsby walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window. The staff members carry flower arrangements and one of them has a very fancy four-tiered pink cake. Nick has a tray of little cupcakes as Gatsby steps up and the staff go into the cottage with the flowers. Gatsby looks tense, frowns, and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes. A clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four as Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements. There's a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons.",
    "1003": "He nods to Nick and takes a deep breath. Gatsby sneaks furtively into the kitchen area and peers through the flowers into the room. Watching from the door, Nick takes off his boater and gestures for Gatsby to tidy his hair. He smooths it back with his hand. Finally, appearing confident and relaxed and with the old familiar glint in his eyes, Gatsby steps towards the room. Nick stands beneath a tree in the rain. Drenched, he returns and sees Gatsby and Daisy deep in conversation. He rattles a bowl in the sink to make his presence known. Daisy and Gatsby don't notice and continue looking deep into each other's eyes, smiling at each other. Nick gives up, walks in and takes off his coat. Gatsby glances at the window then returns his unwavering gaze to Daisy. Her dark eyes return his gaze adoringly. Gatsby smiles, gets up and opens the French windows. A bright blue sky peeps through the diminishing rainclouds. Sunlight glimmers on the calm bay. They step out onto the porch. They rest against a pillar and their fingers touch. They look at each other. He points across the bay. Gatsby walks back inside. They walk up the drive. Daisy looks up in wonder. Surrounded by gushing fountains and ornamental palms, they look up at the house. Gatsby looks at Daisy, framed by the fountain. It's an orange-squeezing machine. Daisy, Gatsby and Nick swim on his private beach. Gatsby dives from a diving pontoon out in the water. Nick films Daisy hitting a golf ball. They tumble into the ballroom. Daisy marvels at the monumental organ. Gatsby takes Daisy and Nick on a tour. He throws shirts from a balcony. Daisy flops onto the pile of brightly colored shirts on the bed. Nick looks down from the balcony in the opulent bedroom. Noticing the change in Daisy's mood, Gatsby goes down to the bed where she sits. Gatsby strokes her chin and she looks up at Nick. Nick walks away somberly. Gatsby kisses her brow. Nick walks down a spiral staircase. He looks at a wall and a desk where pictures and trophies are displayed. A photograph of a distinguished old man. Gatsby sits on his bed, holding Daisy close to him. Daisy rests her head in Gatsby's lap and follows his gaze to the window and beyond. Nick walks over. He takes a book from a shelf. He opens the book. Touched, Daisy runs her fingers over them. Gatsby goes to the other side of the room to answer the phone. He turns his back to Nick and Daisy. Outside, a strong swelling breeze whips up on the balcony. The French windows are blown open. Nick closes them and listens to Gatsby.",
    "1005": "Gatsby stops and turns back. Nick smiles. Gatsby walks between stone pillars off into the dark grounds. He walks amongst the dark trees which are dotted with fireflies and finds Daisy standing by a tree near Nick's cottage. Gatsby, in a dark dinner suit and bow tie, slowly approaches her. They gaze into each other's eyes. He cups his hand against her cheek, leans closer and kisses her passionately on the lips. He wraps his arm around her waist, pulls her close and kisses her neck. Her eyes closed, Daisy tilts her head back, enraptured. Drink in hand, Nick stands on the terrace looking out into the darkness. Looking slightly disheveled, Tom walks up behind him. Nick turns to Tom and frowns. Tom smooths his hair back and turns to the barman. Gatsby continues to cover Daisy in kisses. Gatsby pauses and lifts his head with a slight smile. He meets Daisy's gaze. Nick points his cottage out to Tom. Tom looks towards the cottage. Gatsby touches Daisy's face. Gatsby steps away from Daisy. Slagle and his associates are fighting with the staff. Tom puts down his glass. Nick lifts his glass. Daisy turns to see Nick walk through the trees. Gatsby goes to Herzog. Daisy watches pensively as Gatsby goes with Herzog. The party winds down. Wolfsheim paces in front of Gatsby in his study. Tom and Daisy are driven away from the mansion. Gatsby watches from a window. They're driven away. Standing at the window, Gatsby looks thoughtful. Four of Gatsby's men march Slagle out through the gates. One of them lays into Slagle with heavy punches to the face. Inside, the staff clear up. As his staff busy themselves clearing up the mess, Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay. The green light on the dock at Tom Buchanan's mansion gently pulses. Nick comes down some steps. He tosses a bottle in the pool. Gatsby grabs his suit jacket. Gatsby clenches his eyes shut and pinches the bridge of his nose. In the flashback, Gatsby follows Daisy to an upstairs room. They stand close to each other about to kiss, then Gatsby moves back. A shooting star flies across the night sky. They stand transfixed by each other. Gatsby leans closer and kisses Daisy. They sink into a passionate embrace. They lie together. He kisses her soft white skin and they lie in each other's arms. Daisy's grand house stands alone lit up at night. The light fades. He points up and a star shoots by. He tosses something into the illuminated pool. They both smile wistfully. Gatsby looks across the dark bay. Gatsby smiles confidently and steps over to Nick, who looks down, frowning.",
    "1007": "Two men exit through the revolving doors, followed by Diana emerging from another door. A black Mercedes pulls up, and as Diana gets inside it, motorcycles swarm around the car. The Mercedes pulls away with the motorbikes following her. Video footage shows Diana in a swimming costume in the sea. The Mercedes is pursued by four motorcyclists, each with photographers riding pillion. Archive footage shows a younger Diana driving away from reporters and smiling as a photographer snaps her picture. The paparazzi on motorbikes swerve and jockey for position behind the Mercedes, with six motorbikes now gaining on the car. On a ski slope, Diana reaches out to mask a photographer's lens. As her hand blocks out the sunlight, a tunnel looms ahead of the Mercedes. Meanwhile, Robin lies in bed in a dark room, then switches on a bedside lamp. He hurriedly approaches Balmoral Castle, rushes down a corridor bustling with people, and puts on a black jacket as he walks. Robin rushes up some stairs with a dark-haired woman close behind and stops outside a door while the woman walks up to it. The Queen looks up from her bed, switches on a bedside lamp, and Prince Phillip sits up beside her. She exits the bedroom and Robin bows, then turns to Cherie in bed. Charles enters the room where the Queen Mother, Phillip, and the Queen are present, then turns and leaves the room. Robin approaches a blonde woman, picks up a phone from a nearby desk, and later slowly ascends some stairs. The royal family are still watching the television as Robin enters the room but stays by the door. Charles stands in a dark room with Steven, rubs his brow, and Steven backs away. BBC video news footage plays as Tony stares at a nearby TV. On the other end of the phone, Alistair Campbell scribbles on a note pad. The Queen walks down a dimly lit corridor and peeking through a doorway, sees Charles talking to Prince William and Prince Harry. Charles sees her and leaves the room, then moves to reenter the room. The Queen extends her hand briefly, then retracts it, causing Charles to stop with tears welling in his eyes. The Queen casts her eyes downward, walks down a corridor, and addresses a footman. Later, the Queen sits at a desk and writes in a book. Phillip enters a room, stands by the door, holds out a small bottle of pills, and leaves the room. People are gathering with shocked and anguished expressions on their faces, some burying their faces into their hands.",
    "1009": "Outside, Charles stands with Steven. Charles then walks off, and Steven leaves in another direction. Monday arrives with video footage showing a long line of people standing outside Buckingham Palace, laying more flowers at the gates. Bunches of flowers pile up at the railings as a massive crowd is held back by metal barriers. One woman crouches by the gates, holding a hand to her face. Inside a large room, dignitaries and their advisers sit around a long table. Outside 10 Downing Street, a car stops, and Allister emerges from a backseat door, carrying some papers. After seeing the newspapers, Tony moves to leave. Two men holding rifles exit Balmoral, followed by Charles, William, and Harry. Some Land Rovers are parked in the courtyard. The Queen watches from a window above. The Queen opens a newspaper. Robin enters holding a tray of items. The Queen looks out of the window and clinches her jaw. Robin casts his eyes down. The Queen sits down in a nearby armchair. Robin leaves a notepad on the table close by. Later, Tony sits at a desk with a female assistant beside him. A nervous Charles looks up at Steven. Meanwhile, at the other end, a befuddled Tony puts down the phone. The Queen walks with two black Labradors. The Queen opens the door to an old Land Rover and gets the dogs inside. Charles settles into the passenger seat. The Queen and Charles drive along a country road. The Queen gets out, opens the back door, and the three black Labradors jump out. Charles moves around to the driver's side. Charles drives away, leaving the Queen with the dogs. Figures can be glimpsed on the green hills nearby. One of them looks through some binoculars. Three more stand still while another three lie on the ground. In the distance, over the next hill, a stag stands alone. Later, the Queen sits on a bed and watches footage from an interview with Diana on TV. Philip stands in the doorway. The Queen stares thoughtfully at the TV. The Queen twists a silver pen in her hands. The Queen gazes at Prince Philip for a moment and then turns away. The Queen sips some drink from a glass. A distracted Queen nods faintly. An image of Camilla on horseback appears on TV. The Queen changes the channel, and various images appear: Diana in a black evening dress, Diana next to a land mine danger sign, Diana cuddling children, Diana talking with pensioners, Diana smiling. Tuesday arrives with Tony and Allister walking along. Allister indicates a nearby room. The Queen strolls through some woods, carrying a lunch box and accompanied by some corgis. Some chairs, tables, and a barbecue have been set up in a clearing nearby.",
    "1019": "A couple has sex in a shower behind steamy glass doors. As the woman gets out, her partner follows. A title appears with an arrow pointing at the woman's face. The man opens a bedroom door and finds an adolescent girl with a massive golden-brown curl sleeping face-down in bed. In a t-shirt and boxers, the man lumbers over to the bed and lightly touches her arm. As she lies unresponsive, he barrages her with lazy slaps. She reaches a hand out. He kisses her cheek. Later, he lies close to a little blonde girl and kisses her cheek. He carries her down the hall. The older girl makes bacon and scrambled eggs as her father brings in big, colorful balloons. He sneaks some bacon, drinks OJ from the plastic jug and eats a cupcake. His youngest sets off a confetti shooter. In another room, the wife and mother sits at a window with a towel over her hair. She smokes a cigarette with a latex-gloved hand. Meanwhile, her family hangs streamers, sets out presents and puts candles shaped like the number 38 on a cake. Putting the cigarette out, she uncovers her hair, removes the glove and pops gum in her mouth. She pats her face and hands with a wipe, then sprays herself with perfume. She leans into the kitchen. The youngest shoots confetti. She blows out her birthday candles. Later, the girls sit on a couch a few yards from the kitchen island where their parents relax. Sayid stabs his older companion. Their father takes a cup of berries to the sink. He faces his wife. He runs water over the cupcake. The younger daughter plays a larger keyboard. Her sister throws clothes at a closet. Wearing biking gear, he kisses her goodbye then sneaks over to the kitchen sink. Extracting the cupcake from a soggy bed of scrambled eggs, he unwraps the tainted treat. He glances toward the open front door, then takes a bite. A lanky man leads the woman and a plump brunette up an outdoor flight of stairs at a brisk jog. The brunette lags behind. A goateed man bicycles with the father. A car darts out and nearly hits them. His wife does crunches. The plump woman bounces on a stability ball. Barb's features pinch up. He affects a lonely, pitiful gaze. In a coffeehouse, Pete gives an earnest nod. In an SUV, he sings to his wife. Her sister grabs at the tablet. In a shopping district, as Debbie approaches Jodi, Pete smiles at stunning Desi, who works on a ladder. Jodi nods behind her large, round glasses.",
    "102": "The movie begins with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. A postman then delivers a letter to Bubba's mom, who opens it while surrounded by her many children. She looks at the check and faints. Later, a door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp. Meanwhile, Forrest rides the mower and then steps onto the porch, looking down the road. Jenny's image walks and then vanishes, causing Forrest to look away and turn to walk into the house. Jenny walks across the lawn to Forrest, and later, she lies asleep in bed. The two are seen walking together, and Jenny breaks a window before collapsing to the ground and sobbing. Forrest kneels down next to her, and later, they sit on a limb together. Jenny sits by a vase of flowers and looks out the window, while Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places a box of Nike running shoes in his lap. They sit on a log together and look at the river, and Jenny places her arms around Forrest. Jenny turns off the TV and walks outside, as Forrest stands and puts down his Dr. Pepper. Jenny walks toward the stairs, and Forrest turns and walks toward the door. Jenny turns and walks up the stairs, while Forrest stands outside. The house stands in the rain, and Forrest lies in his bed as the door opens. Jenny gets into bed next to Forrest, and they kiss. Jenny takes off her nightgown as they make love. Later, Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab, which drives away as Forrest is asleep in his bed. The Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle, and Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe. He looks at the medal he had given to Jenny, and Jenny's bed is made. Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed where Jenny had been, still as if in a trance. He sits on a rocking chair with his running shoes on and slowly puts on his Bubba-Gump cap. Forrest stands and walks off the porch, beginning to jog across the lawn. His speed increases as he runs farther away, down the drive away from his house. He runs to the end of the drive, then turns right and runs down the highway. Meanwhile, three men sit as they watch the television. Forrest runs through the main street of town and under the sign and onto the pier. He runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean, with a lighthouse standing at the end of the pier. Forrest runs across the pier and is later seen running along the highway. He runs down a road between fields of wheat, followed by a scene of a mountain river.",
    "1027": "Pete speeds through an intersection and continues onto a busy street, cutting off a car that narrowly avoids him. An SUV pulls up beside him. Back in the kitchen, Oliver cleans up outside. Sadie approaches with Joseph, and Debbie smiles as Joseph avoids her gaze. Sadie leaves and Joseph follows. Pete speeds down the middle of a street, slowing down traffic, and holds out his middle finger, waving a guy past. A car turns right in front of him, and the SUV accelerates ahead. Oliver sits with the girls, glances back at Sadie, flashes a smile, and runs off. Sadie grabs her sister. Pete rides through a red light and makes a left between oncoming cars, then turns left onto a quiet side street, soaring down a winding hilly road. He coasts around a corner, stands upright, and accelerates past a group of serious cyclists. Debbie drives with Larry in her SUV. Pete makes a left at an empty intersection, rides past a white picket fence, and a car door swings open. A husky man looks down at him as Debbie drives by. The man punches Pete in the face, easily absorbs Pete's stomach punch, then knocks Pete over with one. Debbie gets out and runs to Pete. The man gets in his SUV as Pete writhes in glass and pulls away. Pete sees the dealer license plate and puts his head down as Debbie arrives. Now, in a hospital hallway, Debbie shakes her head as she sits with Larry. A nurse approaches, steps away, gives an incredulous look, and hugs him. He gives her back a fatherly pat as she clings to him. They part, and he takes the bill. As he shuffles off, Debbie watches him go with a little smile. On the island, the hero Jack lies dying with Vincent the dog at his side. Oliver watches with the girls and Joseph, holding Charlotte close, and lifts his chin. Now, in the hospital hallway, a window shows Pete on a bed with a bruised, swollen eye. Debbie walks in with a sympathetic smile, and he waves. She perches beside him on the edge of the bed, and her injured husband regards her gravely. Debbie smiles at him, stands, and starts to help him up. He winces, then swings one leg over the bed. As she tries to help him again, Pete sits up and kisses her. They share a tender, lingering smooch. Now at a music club, a young singer with moppy dark brown hair strums a guitar at the mic. Debbie brings Pete a bottle of beer, sets her own drink down, faces the stage, and takes his hand. Pete shrugs and gives a delighted smile.",
    "1030": "At home, he takes pristine white T-shirts off a shelf and lays them in his suitcase with the rest of his clothes. He packs his tie pouch, straightens up and sees the cardboard cut-out. He picks up the photo and holds it over his case length-wise and cross-wise. Wearing a sharp charcoal gray suit, Ryan walks through the airport, dragging the case. Julie and Jim's smiling faces are poking out of the top. Ryan stops and stares. Outside, Natalie is embracing a big beefy guy. Ryan slides his swipe card through the slot on the self-service check-in machine, then collects his boarding pass. Ryan steps away with case in tow. He wearily raises his eyebrows as he watches Natalie come in. She stoops slightly as she drags a large unwieldy suitcase. She has a large black bag slung over her shoulder and a coat over her arm. Ryan looks at her and sighs. She looks blank. At a luggage store, Ryan wheels a wheelie case back and forth. Natalie kneels on the floor, transferring her belongings from her hefty suitcase to the neater, smaller wheelie case. Ryan grabs a travel pillow. He bins it. He bins a full-size pillow. At security, Ryan sees a group of businessmen. Ryan collects his things on the other side of the X-ray machine. Natalie is being scanned. Natalie takes off a bracelet. On the plane, she and Ryan sit side-by-side with the aisle between them. Natalie types on her laptop. He looks across at her. She stares at him. With a dismissive glance, she gets back to work. Ryan smiles wryly. St. Louis. As they walk through the terminal building, Ryan gets a call from Alex. A smile spreads across Ryan's face. Ryan walks through an open-plan office with Natalie, who's clutching a pile of strategy packets. Office workers stare at them as they head to a private office. Natalie silently seethes. An older balding man holds up a photo of two young girls. Sitting opposite him, Ryan glances down. Natalie is beside Ryan. Ryan is incredulous. Bob sits back resigned. Bob shakes his head. Natalie studies Ryan. Craggy-faced Bob stares at Ryan thoughtfully. He glances down at the photos of his girls. Ryan nods to Natalie, who picks up one of the strategy packets and hands it to Bob. Bob looks at the packet and takes it. At the Hilton, Natalie follows Ryan into the lobby. A woman stares as he walks past the queue and up to the desk. He hands her a leaflet. She snatches it. In the dining room, Ryan sits with three plates of food. Natalie sits. Natalie pokes at her plate of food with her fork. Ryan throws out his hand and smiles.",
    "1037": "A bright white light shines in front of a cloudy sky, held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long white robe with a blue sash draped around her. Silver metallic letters appear on a black background, followed by a city skyline framed within a V shape. A motorcade sweeps through the city streets with motorcycles in the background, moving past a tall stone bell tower towards the flashing lights of a parked police car. A GNN TV camera is fixed on the vehicles as the convoy comes to a halt and cameras flash. The President, a tall man with a receding hairline, emerges with his guards and they move away from the car. One of the Secret Service agents, Barnes, a man in his 50s with a furrowed brow, glances all around, scanning rooftops and the protesters as he walks ahead of the President. On a preview monitor, the GNN gallery crew watch footage of an assassination attempt on President Ashton. Barnes takes the bullets for the President, who is hustled to safety and recoils as a bomb goes off in the plaza. Smoke erupts from the explosion and blanks out the TV cameras, covering the plaza in its dense blanket. The gallery is stunned. As the smoke clears, the director catches sight of Angie lying on the ground, blood on her forehead and chest amongst the rubble. The picture constantly breaks up and the director and her assistant fight back tears. The director, 40-something Rex Brooks, gets to her feet and switches off the feed, her face haggard and weary, then sits back down by her younger, weeping PA. The events rewind to pre-explosion with Angie reporting and the President at the lectern, the motorcade en route to the plaza. Agent Barnes, his torso bare, turns from his window, nods to his colleague Ken Taylor, then turns back to gaze out of the window as he puts on a shirt, revealing a scar on his back. Barnes sits down on his bed, has his tie in his hand as he fastens his shirt, and reaches for a pill bottle. Popping the lid, he tips the bottle but grimaces and returns the pill back to the bottle which he places on the bedside cabinet. Barnes lifts his gun from the cabinet and checks its magazine. In a hotel corridor, Barnes puts on his jacket as he walks in front of a large window against which he is silhouetted.",
    "1045": "Howard zooms back in vision as Barnes watches keenly. Barnes sees Veronica throw her bag under the podium just before an explosion throws Barnes and Howard off their feet. Flames soar up from the podium, and black smoke fills the plaza. As the smoke subsides, Howard slowly sits up and rubs the back of his neck. The once highered flags hang limp and torn. Howard checks his hand for blood, then takes in the scene of devastation in front of him. He stretches out for his camera by his side, then sees Barnes with the injured Matthews. Howard pushes himself up onto his feet and looks around. He sees little Anna standing alone. She nods OK. He picks her up in his arms and runs out of the plaza with her. Outside, he hears Holden chasing Enrique. Anna nods again. He sees Enrique making his escape with Holden and Parsons in pursuit. Howard, still carrying Anna, runs after them. He stops in front of a policewoman as Enrique keeps running. Holden and Parsons race after Enrique on the street outside the plaza. Howard heads after them, filming as he goes. Enrique dashes into a gated stone building. Holden and Parsons sprint after him. Howard charges through the tall gate where he comes to a halt inside a large church. The agents pursue Enrique out into the street. Howard is hot on their tail. Anna looks frantically for her mother. She mistakenly chases a different olive skin woman. Howard videotapes a red sedan plowing into Enrique. Enrique staggers to his feet and runs. Parsons and Holden dart after him across the busy road. Howard dashes through the panicking crowd in hot pursuit. They race under colored canopies on a market street. Heavyset Howard stops to catch his breath. He gets Holden and Parsons on tape as they disappear around a corner. His eyes roam frantically and he darts down a parallel street. Beating down the side street as he runs, Howard sees Enrique make a B-line for a busy highway. Howard beams incredulously and gives chase with the camcorder held out in front of him. Enrique's pistol is holstered in his belt beside his police badge. A white sedan brakes sharply as he bounds out into the road. Howard stops by the roadside. He spots a pedestrian bridge over the highway. Enrique bolts out into oncoming traffic. Howard scampers up steel steps and hot foots it along the bridge. He stops and stares out some chain link mesh to see Enrique slow to a stop at an underpass. Howard cranes the camera on him. He sees Enrique's badge. A squad car drives up in front of Enrique, and a policeman approaches him.",
    "1047": "McCullough proffers the phone, and Ashton stares at them soberly. A bomb explodes on the ground floor of the hotel, and Ashton goes to the window, peering down at strewn bodies and flaming debris. McCullough holds out the phone and shoots Ashton a solemn look. A blast blows the door open and throws them to the floor. A man in a balaclava enters holding a pistol. He dispatches Heinkin, McCullough, and Cavic. He trains the pistol on the President, who cowers in a corner. A bright, white flash occurs, and events run in reverse order. Gunshots are fired, and black smoke rises from the bomb blast. The president's double is shot. Ashton sits safely in his limousine. Anna receives an ice cream cone and nods. Seated, Sam smiles at Anna. Veronica talks with a handsome, heavy-featured man, Javier. She holds up a bracelet. Javier glares at her and flexes his jaw. Raven-haired Veronica produces a cell phone and plays him a video of a bound and gagged man in his 20s. He grabs her wrist, takes the bracelet, and grabs her head, glowering inches from her face. He lets go and strides off. Javier's eyes meet with Enrique's as they pass each other. Javier walks past curly-haired Marie and pony-tailed Anna. Seated at his table in the cafe, Sam toggles through screens on his PDA phone. He uses a touch screen wand to initiate a phone call and glances at the television. A bellboy answers a phone in the hotel reception, and Felipe the bellboy hangs up the phone. The motorcade enters the underground parking lot. Javier answers his mobile, takes the phone from his ear, then gasps as he approaches the hotel. Sam punches buttons on his phone and talks into the mic of his hands-free kit. On TV, Ashton's double approaches the podium and pushes a button. A police constable scans Javier with a metal detector outside the Hotel Vesta. He points at Javier's pocket, and Javier takes out a cell phone. Felipe opens the door for a woman entering the hotel. Javier approaches, then shakes Javier's hand, placing a small envelope into it. Javier enters the lobby, which is filled with Secret Service agents. Javier talks into his cell phone as he passes the suited agents. Javier lowers his phone and calls an elevator. He turns the credit card sized envelope in his hands. Sam steps out of the cafe onto the sunny street, the wire from his hands-free kit trailing down his white T-shirt to the phone in his hand.

Mrs. Gump opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns as he plays the guitar and sings. Forrest holds onto a broom and dances oddly, his legs rocking back and forth to the guitar. The young man is Elvis Presley. Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door. Elvis sits back down and Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays the guitar and sings. Forrest stands left and looks himself in a mirror, dancing as he watches himself. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk. The television reveals Elvis as he thrusts his hips and sings.

    "1051": "He hands her the letter, bows, then heads off. Lizzy watches him for a moment, looks down at the letter, then searches for a comfortable place to read it. She settles down on a large tree stump. After folding up the letter, Lizzy walks off. Mariah follows her inside and up the stairs. Lizzie hurries to her room and shuts the door behind her. Inside, she sits down near a window and opens up the letter again. Lizzie cringes as she remembers her family's improper behavior. Then she looks down at the letter once more. Meanwhile, Darcy watches from above as Jane heads out dressed in a grey cloak and bonnet. Later, Lizzie is walking with Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins goes to bid his farewells to Lizzie. He looks over at his wife and gives her a little wave. She and Lizzie exchange a knowing smile. The horse-drawn carriage pulls away from the parsonage, gathering speed along the country road. Lizzie and Mariah are sitting inside. Mariah has a notebook open. Lizzie leans forward in her seat, looking thoughtful. As she stares out of the window, memories of Darcy pass through her mind. A clatter of horses' hooves sounds. Finally, the carriage pulls up outside a busy inn. Lydia opens one of the upper windows excitedly. Lizzie waves up at her and Kitty. Lydia indicates that she'll come down and meet them then closes the window. She embraces her sister warmly then sits back on the bed. He leaves the room. Angrily, she throws down her knife, fork, and napkin. Now, Lizzie's out in the garden, carrying a basket full of flowers. She walks around Jane, who's busy sniffing blooms to put in her basket. Lizzie casts frequent concerned glances over at her sister. She comes over and takes Lizzie's hand. Jane sets off back towards the house, carrying her basket of flowers. As Lizzie is about to follow, her mother appears. Kitty stomps back into the house. Lizzie is with her father. Mr. Bennett gently pulls Lizzie onto a seat beside him. Officers from Wickham's regiment are taking tea at Longbourn. Lydia is having the time of her life. Wickham makes his way over to Lizzie. Lizzie takes a sip of tea.

They wave excitedly at the occupants. Four children emerge first from the cab. Lizzie kisses her aunt and uncle.",
    "1055": "Mr. Darcy raises a hand to his mouth, then leaps from his seat, his mouth tight and brows furrowed. Lizzie lowers her eyes, sadness filling her face, and curtsies. Mr. Darcy gives his usual, stilted bow in return, turns and leaves the room, but stops at the door and looks back at Lizzie for a moment before finally walking out. The horses are being harnessed to the carriage outside as Mrs. Gardiner and Lizzie emerge, dressed in their outdoor clothes. Lizzie turns to him, then climbs into the carriage. At Pemberley, Mr. Darcy is sitting in the drawing room, watching Georgiana practice her piano playing, with the Hursts, Mr. Bingley, and Miss Bingley also present. Miss Bingley stands up and with a look of utter contempt, Mr. Darcy leaves the room, causing the two sisters to exchange glances. At Longbourn, the Gardiners' four children are playing on the lawn when the carriage pulls into the driveway and they quickly hurry over to greet it. As the four white horses come to a halt, the footman comes over to open the carriage door and help Lizzie out. Briefly greeting the children, Lizzie hurries inside, where Jane has come to meet her. In her bedroom, Mrs. Bennet is lying back in her chair, fanning herself. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is traveling in a carriage, his expression thoughtful and determined, with four chestnut horses speeding through the countryside, a seated driver and two footmen on the back of his carriage. Now, the Bennet sisters are taking lunch with the Gardiners. Later, Lizzie enters a room and finds Jane standing at the window, gazing out at the gardens. She shuts the door behind her, then walks over to her sister. Lizzie opens it and begins to read. Lydia and Wickham climb into a carriage in the dead of night. Jane looks away with a serious expression, and Lizzie leaves the room. Now, Lizzie is in her nightgown, standing in front of the mirror in her room. Slowly, she looks herself in the eye, then sits down. Her face is full of sorrow, and her eyes are glistening with as yet unshed tears. She remembers Mr. Darcy striding away from her. The knock disturbs her thoughts. Jane comes in and shuts the door behind her, walks over to Lizzie and takes her hand. Lizzie looks down, then takes Jane's hand again. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy has arrived at a coaching inn. As the innkeeper leads him, a serving boy comes out with tankards full of ale. Mr. Darcy takes one and drinks from it. The next day, Kitty is playing with a cup and bowl in the garden. She spies a two-wheeled curricle approaching through the trees and quickly scampers off across the lawn.",
    "1058": "An empty carriage arrives at Longbourn. As it stops and the footman opens the door, the Wickhams exit the house surrounded by Lydia's sisters and parents. He ushers Lydia into the carriage, and as it departs, Lydia leans out to wave goodbye to her family. Later, Lizzie and Jane walk in the gardens under bright sun. Indoors, Mary practices piano, Kitty decorates a straw bonnet then tosses it away, Mrs. Bennet lies on a chaise lounge fanning herself and ordering servants, and Mr. Bennet reads by the fire. Lizzie, in her nightgown, sits before her mirror, gazes sadly at her reflection, then blows out the candle. The next day is bright and sunny. Mrs. Phillips visits Mrs. Bennet at Longbourn. A horse and cart filled with trunks arrives at Netherfield, servants open shutters, light fires, and carry in food. Mr. Bingley is out shooting. In the kitchen, herbs are hung up.

Everyone sits, except Mr. Darcy, who goes to the window, smiles at Jane, and continues looking out as Lizzie glares at her mother. The gentlemen ride away from Longbourn. Jane and Lizzie stroll in the gardens, Jane looking sheepish. At Netherfield, Mr. Bingley watches as Mr. Darcy departs in his carriage. Mr. Bingley rides to Longbourn. She bursts into Lizzie's room.

    "1062": "Jack is flummoxed. Jenny picks up her parcels and goes into the living room, glaring at her father. David hangs his head as Jenny sighs. Jack struggles to make the next move. David gleams at Jenny who tries to suppress a broad grin. They drive off for the evening. Jenny looks around the sparsely furnished room with modern wooden furniture and shoots him a glance. Later they are lying in bed together, kissing face to face. David in his pajama bottoms gets up, Jenny sits up and watches him go through to the other room. She self consciously adjusts her nightie, stumped, and buries her face in her pillow. He flops down on the bed, studies her uncertainly, smiles apologetically and hangs his head. He sits side by side on the satin. Jenny grins at David then reaches forward and grabs a banana. Sun shines on the Eiffel Tower. Jenny and David in film stars sunglasses wander among booksellers on the banks of the Seine. Jenny finds a book she loves and looks imploringly at David. He smiles and reaches for his wallet, then holds her hand as she walks along high wall. David boxes Jenny into position for a photo of her with Notre Dame Cathedral in the background. She poses. The guy on a bicycle checks her out as he rides past. David's less than impressed, then takes another photo. They run up steep stones steps then walk arm in arm, joining another couple's slow dancing in the sunshine to a record playing on a small portable turntable. They lie cheek to cheek and drink wine with a picnic by the river of dusk. Jenny rests her head on David's shoulder. In the morning, Jenny looks out from their hotel at the great dome of the Sacre-Coeur, smiles, thinks for a moment then shakes her head. Jenny puts a bottle of Chanel on her teacher's desk, then disappointedly puts the bottle back in her satchel. The teacher looks up as she leaves. The words hit home and Jenny thinks hard, challenging Miss Stubs with a look. Miss Stubs turns away. Gray hounds burst out of starting gates into the track. Jenny, David, Danny and Helen were in the crowd. They climb the stands to a private suite. David shakes hands with a man by the door. They file in. Jenny gives her coat to Danny. Their contact is holding court in a white dinner jacket. Danny and David move off. Jenny and Helen drink champagne. Danny leads Jenny to the dance floor. They move flirtatiously. Helen worriedly watches David watching them. Jenny and Danny dance with their eyes locked together, Jenny smiles, her gaze never wavering from his.",
    "1063": "Helen looks bored, then smiles ruefully at David, who watches expressionlessly before smiling and turning to watch the dancers returning. Helen and Danny watch them leave. David and Jenny walk to the car park in their overcoats. David opens the boot and rummages inside. Her eyes wheel up as she looks at him. He tries to take her hand. Back at home, she sits studying, then slams down her book, opens the bedroom window, and smoking, looks out to the street lights. Her parents are downstairs in the kitchen; Jenny watches her parents doing the washing up. It's an engagement ring. Miss Stubs looks daggers at her. The headmistress straightens archly. Jenny rolls her tear-filled eyes, turns, and walks out. Jenny walks down a corridor carrying her blazer and satchel, glances into her classroom as she walks out of the school's main doors, walks down the pavement, then breaks into a run. A gaggle of her friends watch her go. Danny's got a stuffed armadillo and looks worried. David and Jenny leave Danny's place, head for the car. David opens the door for her. They drive off into the London twilight. Marjorie eyes her husband reproachfully. David shakes Jack's hand. They troop out to the Bristol, hit for town in the gathering twilight, stop off at the petrol station. The attendant pumps the fuel. David goes into the shop of the village garage. Jenny reaches into the glove box for the cigarettes. The packet is empty. Jack manages to break a door handle. There's a pile of envelopes in the glove box. Jenny looks through them. David returns from the garage, notices Jenny looking at the envelopes. Jenny sits expressionlessly as they drive back. Jenny gets out and steps away from the car. Her parents go indoors and David approaches Jenny. He shakes his head. She looks at the envelopes then shoves them back at him. David looks at her pleadingly. They stand apart. Jenny wipes tears from her face. David shakes his head, opens the boot, takes the bottle from a case. Jenny eyes him frostily, turns on her heel and walks indoors. David goes to the driver's door and gets in the car. Indoors Jenny stands alone in the hallway. David swigs from the bottle then drops it on the passenger seat, stares mournfully into the distance. His lower lip trembles as he starts to cry. Jenny fidgets in the hall staring at the front door. Hearing the car, Jack gets up and goes to the window. Tears run down Jenny's cheeks as headlights sweep past the window. Jenny hangs her head. Danny's playing with a cricket ball as Helen sits with Jenny.",
    "1067": "Nullah stares into the distance. Sarah rides up to the house. Drover comes out the back door. She freezes, keeping her back to him. On the porch, he turns slowly and looks at her. He walks towards Magarri and the horses, as her eyes fill with tears. She whirls round and goes back indoors, as he rides away. Nullah's dog attacks a cop whose chasing him. He turns slowly and looks into the eyes of a half-naked black tracker. Callahan finds Fletcher at the movies. King George is flung into cell, as Nullah is dragged away. Sarah drives through crowds on the wharf. Troopships crowd Darwin harbor. Nullah is with a group of half-caste children being shipped out. His grandfather hears in his cell. Sarah drives past lines of marching troops. Nullah stares at the white boy. Troops and civilians swarm towards the wharf. Sarah stops at a barrier and gets out of the car. Callahan drags the white boy away, as a priest pulls Nullah. Crocodile boots stop in front of him and Nullah looks up into Fletcher's face. Sarah barges her way anxiously through the crowd on the wharf. Smoke rises from ships' funnels. The priest leads him to a waiting boat. Fletcher observes, slyly. She runs down the wharf, as Nullah runs to the stern of the boat. The small boat pulls out of the shadow of the huge liners evacuating the town. The boy looks up at Sarah. Fletcher grins. Nullah waves to Sarah, who stops at the end of the wharf. Fletcher leans on the railing next to her, as the boat sails away. He turns smugly to her. He grins and saunters off. On the back of the boat, Nullah turns and looks up at a priest. Sarah leans on the wharf rail in despair, trying to control her sobs. The children's boat sails away from the wharf between huge, grey navy vessels. A Japanese fighter skims through the clouds towards an island. Sarah steps out onto the balcony and looks out over the harbor. He looks across at Drover, who's standing thoughtfully by a tree. As he whistles, Magarri stares at Drover, who looks uncomfortable and tentatively lays his hand on the tree. Magarri turns away and tears fill the Drover's eyes. Their vehicles raise a cloud of dust on the other side of the river they are camping next to. Clouds fill the sky. Fighters take off at dawn from an aircraft carrier. Mission Island sits peacefully in the grey sea, beneath the cloudy sky. The children are asleep in their dormitory. Nullah wakes up with a start. Smiling unpleasantly, Fletcher hangs up the phone in his office overlooking the whole of Darwin.",
    "1069": "Drover staggers, distraught, through the burning wreck of the Carney house, sobbing in uncontrollable grief. The flickering flames illuminate the calm figure of King George, as others mill around trying to help. Drover walks through the town, King George shadowing him. He looks out across the bay at the broken, burning hulks of ships, then walks towards the shattered pub. Some people are trying to patch it up, while others sit around staring or drinking vacantly. Drover approaches Ivan, who's sweeping up in the bar. Magarri follows him. Drover looks around, taking in the white drinkers and his nervous black brother-in-law, then turns slowly back to Ivan. Ivan stares, as tears of grief and rage run down his face. The bar patrons stare as Drover looks round at Magarri. Magarri enters tentatively, removing his hat, and approaches the bar. A woman glares at him, drawing on a cigarette, the tip glowing in the gloom. Ivan has placed a glass and a tin cup on the bar. Tears roll down Drover's cheeks. Reluctantly, Ivan replaces the cup with another glass. Ivan looks at Magarri and raises a glass. Magarri eyeballs him and glances at Drover. They all take a drink. The empty glasses are placed on the bar. Magarri wipes away a tear. Drover frowns in disbelief. Dutton checks the body on the stretcher. Sarah comes in. Drover's eyes bore into her, trying to make her understand. A priest is down at the wharf. Drover releases the mooring, taking a chain out of Bull's unconscious hand, and runs onto the small Mission Island sailing boat. The priest prays. Magarri holds a rifle and Drover stands holding a rope, as they get underway. Sarah stares, grief-stricken, at the devastation. The wooden buildings of the Mission burn fiercely in the night. Drover, Magarri, and Ivan stand staring on the beach. Drover nods to Magarri, who moves off. Drover, fearful of what he might find, moves slowly up the beach. Weapons raised, they pass burning buildings and approach the tree line. Drover looks into a building and sees a row of boys' shoes. He looks horrified and lowers his rifle. His eyes fill with tears. He turns towards the noise, raising his rifle. Something is moving in the undergrowth. A boy emerges. Drover lowers his weapon, as more children come out of the undergrowth. He smiles with relief, as Magarri beckons the boys forward. Another figure with long hair appears. They embrace, throwing their arms around one another. Drover holds the boy out at arm's length and grins happily, stroking his hair. Nullah hangs his head sadly. A torch beam sweeps across the water towards them. They look around fearfully, as armed figures march out of the jungle through the smoke.",
    "1076": "Sarah gapes open-mouthed at the soaring crags as the herd moves towards a dark canyon with sheer cliffs rising up on either side. King George keeps watch from the top of the cliffs while four horsemen approach, riding line abreast. A fire burns in the Drovers' camp where Nullah's sitting on a rock, and Sarah's in her tent, writing. Flynn stares at the boy. Up on the cliff, King George makes a fire by drilling a stick into a piece of wood, and some kindling. She sticks her tongue out at him as he closes his eyes and looks up at the star-dusted sky. As the sun comes up the horsemen arrive on the rocky ridge and look down at the cattle huddled in the canyon shadows. Flynn takes his harmonica off Nullah. Something has spooked the cattle. Petrol from a metal can is sprinkled on the ground by Fletcher's men. Fletcher gets off his horse, and the bearded Bull holds up a flaming torch. He hurls it into the canyon. King George observes from his perch. Flynn and Nullah watch the torch falling through the darkness, and orange flames leap up as it hits the ground. Cattle stampede as fire erupts behind them. Drover clambers onto a rock and sees the herd thundering out of the canyon. Behind the herd is a wall of flame. Ahead of them, beyond the mouth of the canyon, is a sheer drop. Drovers urge their horses on, desperately trying to get ahead of the herd. They split into two groups, going either side of the herd. Fletcher's crew follow on a path along the cliff above. Nullah gallops along the cliff edge, heading the herd away from the precipice. Nullah turns and grins at Flynn. Cattle tumble into the abyss. Flynn's eyes widen in fear as the cliff edge curves round in front of them. They hurtle along with a sheer drop on one side and the mass of cattle on the other. Up on the cliff, Fletcher urges his horse on. Flynn rides next to Nullah on the cliff edge, showing off, riding one-handed. Fletcher and his men stop and look down at the herd, which is now heading across open ground. Fletcher gives a signal, and another fire is lit. As a wall of flame appears in front of the herd, Flynn's horse trips and he's thrown off. King George watches from a high outcrop. The fire's cut the herd off from open ground, and is funneling them towards the cliff. Nullah reins in his horse and looks towards Flynn, who's on the ground in the path of the stampede. The other riders try to reach Flynn, who looks in terror towards the oncoming herd.",
    "1081": "Girls peel potatoes as some men pray. In his cabin, Tuvia polishes a chess piece with a cloth while Aron, sitting by the chessboard, smiles at him. Chaya beams at Asael. At night, as the community sleeps, one man stands guard. By a railway line in daylight, Gramov places a playing card on top of a detonator and slides it under the rail. Explaining to Zus, he removes the card, inserts a knife blade into a hole in the detonator and turns it. Zus nearly jumps out of his skin, picks up the detonator, and goes. Gramov retrieves his playing card and follows him. At the camp, Shimon is giving a chess lesson. Asael scowls at Arkady. Bella and Asael look across at Chaya, as she appears carrying a basket. Asael takes a glug of the confiscated vodka, and goes to meet her. Chaya smiles and lowers her eyes. Asael's lips part but no sound comes out. He nods and exhales, shyly she takes his hand. Later, Shimon officiates their wedding. Snow billows. A German truck crawls on a snowy track. The Russians line wait. When Shimon nods, Tuvia steps forward with a ring. Asael tends to Chaya who has a shawl over her long loose hair, and takes her hand. He kisses his young bride, the onlookers smile. Standing under the chuppah, Asael stamps on a glass. And the Russians let go. Germans fall on mountains. At the wedding, people start to dance. Tuvia hugs Asael. The young couple dance. In the woods, Zus leads the onslaught. Zus fires on a truck. Tuvia enjoys the circular dance, smiles across at Lilka. Zus sets a bomb under the truck. Tuvia finds Lilka as the dancers surge into the middle. Dead Germans are searched. Two officers kneeling await their fate. Zus comes up behind them and shoots them both in the head. Chaya in a chair is lifted up to shoulder height and twirled around. Panchenko addresses Zus as he walks by. Chaya and Asael are both held aloft by their well-wishers, who jig up and down in a huddle. Together the young couple hold the napkin that was wrapped around the glass Asael crushed with his foot. Deep winter has set in at the Naliboki Forest Camp. A table and bench are blanketed in snow. A wheelbarrow stands marooned. Frozen washing hangs heavily on the line. A woman breaks the ice that has formed in a bucket of water. Next to her, Chaya ladles out some soup to a long line of people. Asael, standing in a gutter nearby, holds up two potatoes. Tuvia looks around at the ashen faces of the people queuing up for food.",
    "1087": "Malbin shakes his head and looks behind him at Chaya, who is weeping. Tuvia crouches down, his whole body trembling, and stares ahead like a man who has lost his way. Malbin looks to Shimon for an answer. She brings out a revolver, and he checks the chamber and hands it back to her. He cocks his own gun. Asael hands Layla over. Tuvia looks into Lilka's eyes then springs to his feet. Handing Asael the connected belts, Tuvia looks deeply into his fearless brother's face and kisses him gratefully on the cheek. The Bielski Otriad set off, treading carefully through the foot-high water, holding on to the rope made up of all their belts with one hand to keep their balance and to keep connected. As they proceed, the water level rises to their knees. A woman slips but is helped to her feet. Asael, at the back, not holding the belt, loses his footing but manages to keep his rifle above the water. Now, with the water level up to their waist, they trudge like a funeral cortege slowly and solemnly across the endless flat marsh. Asael and Tuvia at the head of the column wade through the mushy water. Shimon is being supported by Rachel and Malbin. A distant plane roars above their heads, but they trudge on. Children are carried on the adults' shoulders as they wade through a reed bed, their steps making spirals in the placid surface of the water. Asael turns around to Malbin, who is trying to follow a map. In a narrow woodland area, Shimon, clutching his leather briefcase, starts to stumble and falls to one side. Riva, the nurse, stops to attend him. Tuvia bends over his old teacher and pulls the old man onto his back, leaving the leather bag of books behind. The winding column of men, women, and children emerges from the wooded area into bright sunshine and a flowing stream. People clamber out of the water onto a grassy bank, sinking down to rest their weary legs, smiling and laughing with relief. Shimon is brought up onto the meadow on a stretcher. Aaron runs up and taps Tuvia on the shoulder. He points across at Malbin next to his intellectual aspiring partner stroking the old man's grizzled and deathly pale face. Tuvia crouches down at Shimon's side. Malbin looks anxiously across at Tuvia, who wipes his eyes leveled on the old man's face as he breathes his last. Tuvia looks up sharply. A tank appears on the brow of the hill. Cannonballs explode among the fleeing Bielskis. Couching low, Tuvia sprints between the cowering people. Lilka passes ammo to those with guns. The German infantry are coming at them.",
    "1092": "Tuvia throws out some wire across the track and a German motorbike comes into view, plowing into the wire as the brothers watch. The Bielskis swarm towards the German soldier sprawled on the ground, relieve the dead man of his weapon, and rifle through his saddle bags. A car's headlights appear in the distance. Zus and the others pick up the body, carry it to the side of the road, and toss it down into the wood. They take up their positions and watch the car draw nearer. The driver gets out of the open-topped car to investigate the obstacle in the road and peers to the side of the road near to where Zus and the others are hiding. The two Germans in the car and their female companion light up. The driver opens his fly and takes a leak all over Zus who tries to protect his face with his hands. The driver spots him and Zus stabs him. The other Germans are ambushed from behind. The sergeant shoots blindly into the darkness. Asael and others chase after a private. Zus unleashes machine gun fire. Asael chases after the fleeing private and brings him down. Zus finishes up the Germans in the car. Asael shoots his prey point blank. The group examine the weapons they have collected. More headlights appear in the distance, shining their beams straight at them. The brothers line up and open fire into the dazzling light. Peretz is hit. Asael recoups more guns and runs into a field. Tuvia helps Peretz to his feet and pulls him away from the line of fire. He picks up another rifle and dashes into the bushes. An armored vehicle drives up. Soldiers jump off the back and run after Asael who's haring across a field. Tuvia and Peretz stop by and watch the truck slowing down. A search light on its route picks out Asael running across the field. Armed Germans go after Asael, but their bullets whiz past him. The heavy search light is on ground and picks out Tuvia, who fires straight at it, destroying the bulb. Asael is pursued like an animal. He and Zus gather up their armory of guns and run. The next morning at their camp, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with fury in his pale blue eyes. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking pot with a ladle. Shimon in his hat, coat, and woolen scarf, watches her grimly. Others in the camp look pale and gaunt. Aron, chewing on a piece of bread, hands it to Rachel, the teenage girl, and she devours it. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open, but lifeless. Malbin shakes his head.",
    "1093": "A thin hollowed cheek man wanders towards them. Both Zus and Tuvia scramble to their feet and point their weapons. Zus runs after Lazar. Tuvia leaves Zus on the ground where he pushed him. The tall stranger addresses him. All eyes are on Tuvia. With his machine gun over his shoulder, he takes a step backwards and surveys the group, his face angry and dismayed. He glances across at Zus, who is skulking by a tree. Everyone turns to young Aron. Tuvia's tough expression weakens, and his thin lips tremble. Zus looks from Aron to Tuvia, waiting for a response. Tuvia tries to compose his face. He steps towards Aron and cradles his head in his arms. Aron wraps his arms around his big brother. Later hiding in some woodland with Zus and Benzion by his side. Tuvia appears through binoculars at Koscik's farmhouse. The three of them step towards it. Koscik's wife is in the garden hanging up washing. The three partisans armed with rifles come past a flock of geese on their way to the barn. Nearing the door, they stop as a pair of legs comes into view. Koscik is hanging from a rafter, with a wooden sign around his neck. Zus bangs a cross into the ground. Tuvia, holding a shovel, steps away from Koscik's newly dug grave. Her long, black skirt trailing on the ground, she leads the three men to a haystack, where Tuvia and Zus open the trapdoor. They peer down into a shelter and smile. The brothers help Asael out into the sunshine. Zus gives him a bear hug. Two women climbed, one a teenager, the other in her 30s. Zus leads Bella and Chaya away. Tuvia thanks Koscik's widow. He runs after the others. At the camp Shimon and Malvin are shoving earth. The intellectuals shrug and get on with their digging. Asael is intently looking at the blond teenager. Tuvia gives Chaya a friendly wave. Asael strolls down to Chaya and Tuvia cracks a rare smile. An elderly Russian in a horse drawn cart trundles along the dirt track. Zus with his machine gun steps out in front of him. Asael and Ben Zion step out. Zus smiles doubtfully. Later, wearing the man's coat and carrying two churns, Zus leads the way back through the woods. A man approaches Chaya. At dusk, Benzion comes up to Tuvia who is sitting by a fire, reading. Tuvia's rugged face stiffens. Benzion nods respectfully and leaves Tuvia alone. A young boy plays the violin. People in the camp sit quietly. Sadness and loss etched on their faces. Asael watches Chaya from a distance. At the bottom of a leaf strewn slope Tuvia stands alone by a stream grieving.",
    "1095": "At a rest stop, an old woman wrapped in a heavy shawl chews on some food. A man bites into an apple. Asael and Chaya sit together. People huddled on the ground look up at Tuvia, but only Zus stands up, draping his machine gun over his shoulder. Tuvia nods, and the two of them set off, both wearing caps and scarves wrapped around their necks. A Russian in a gray army coat and fur hat steps out from behind a tree. Soldiers surround the Bielski brothers. They put up their hands without resistance. Zus steps forward. The man shrugs and beckons for them to follow him. He strolls off ahead whistling. He leads them into a military camp past a soldier on horseback. A middle-aged man with bags under his eyes, a black fur hat and a black leather coat over his coffee uniform, emerges from a tent. Zus shoots a glance at his brother's impassive face. \"Says the commander with a smirk.\" Tuvia salutes. Panchenko returns the salute. The whistling Russian Gramov escorts them out of the camp. A view of a thick pine forest. Tuvia rides up on a white horse. And with quiet pride, watches his flock, young and old, busily building a new camp. Aron and Asael saw wood. Arkady hammers a roof beam. Shimon in his hat, overcoat, and scarf wields an axe. Malbin is using an axe handle to secure a nail. Tuvia tosses him a hammer. Zus overhearing scowls. Zus listens uneasily. Later, Asael comes into the camp with more people. Bella is peeling potatoes. Kneels down taking off his hat and kisses the ground. He looks round eagerly and address Benzion. Tuvia glances at Malbin. Itzak bends to kiss Tuvia's hand. Malbin leads Itzak away past Zus, who scowls at Tuvia. Chaya turns to Asael. Tuvia smiles coldly. Zus whacks Tuvia in the face. Asael and Chaya watch in dismay. Shimon, Malbin, Lazar and the others look accusingly at Zus. He steps towards Tuvia, who's looking at the blood on his fingers. Tuvia hits back and launches himself at his brother. Benzion tries to pull them apart, but is shoved to one side. Zus' next blow sends Tuvia reeling to the ground. Aron looks at them both in shock. Zus rolls Tuvia on his back with a flick of his foot. Tuvia slowly scrambles to his feet. Zus spits and whacks his brother again with another kick. He pulls him up with both hands and slams him back onto the muddy ground. He goes to do it again, but Tuvia fists him in the groin. He pushes Zus down on his back, picks up a round stone and prepares to throw it.",
    "1105": "Thao meets Walt near the house. Walt grabs his arm. Thao starts to walk away, then stops and looks back before going. Walt wanders off, frowning. Spider and one of his sidekicks come out of a house and get into the Honda parked by the curb. They are watched from across the road by Walt, who's parked in his pickup truck. He watches grim-faced as the Honda drives off. Walt picks up his Colt .45 automatic and cocks it, then talks to Daisy. He gets out of the pickup truck. As Smokie comes out of the house, Walt grabs him, throws him onto the lawn, and kicks him repeatedly in the face, following up with a few punches. A cat scampers past and Walt draws his gun. Evening, it's raining as Walt drives his pickup truck back to his house. He parks on his drive and gets out with Daisy. They walk up the steps onto the porch and Daisy crosses his path. He bends down and picks up a key from under an ornament, winces as he straightens up, and unlocks the door. He and Daisy go inside. Walt cooks a barbeque for Sue, Thao, their mother, and Youa. Youa and Thao grin and nod. Walt points at the Gran Torino. Walt sits in his living room with Daisy, sipping a beer and watching a ball game on TV. Spider's car cruises down the street outside. As it passes Thao's house, gang members discharge a couple of MAC-10 machine guns into the building. Hearing the noise, Walt leaps up and takes his Colt out of a drawer. Bullets rip through Thao's house. Walt runs out onto his porch as the Honda speeds away. Walt watches it go, then runs down off the porch and dashes into Thao's house. He runs into the living room, where Thao is picking himself up. Thao has a minor neck injury. She comes downstairs. Thao makes a call, then turns to a grim-faced Walt and shakes his head. Thao begins to sob. Walt sits with Thao and his mother in their kitchen. Walt sips a rice liquor. Grandma sees a car go by outside. She hurries to the door and everyone follows. Sue comes in. Her face is a bleeding mass of contusions. Watching, Walt drops his glass. Sue is helped to a chair by her mother and Grandma. Blood runs down her face and legs. Thao clings to his mother and sobs. Appalled, Walt stares at Sue, his mouth hanging open. He walks away from Thao's house, pushing the Colt into his belt. He walks into his kitchen and leans against a worktop.",
    "111": "Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away. He, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river. Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder. Later, the shadow of a helicopter appears over the rice field below. A soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The soldier looks left, and Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter. The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase. Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear and look around oddly. The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases and takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer. Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent, shirtless, holding a roll of toilet paper in his hand. He looks at Bubba. Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, not getting the joke. Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him. Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys. He steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT. Meanwhile, a distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow. Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead. Another relative, wearing a World War II uniform, falls down dead on the beach at Normandy. Lt. Dan steps back up to Bubba and Forrest. He walks along the walkway, and Bubba and Forrest follow. Lt. Dan steps inside the latrine, still holding the roll of toilet paper. He sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands up, looking at the boys. He sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba and Forrest look at each other. Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are working as the soldiers walk past. Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road. Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to stop. He motions for them to get down. Forrest gets down and looks around. Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan crouches down. He looks at the soldiers and points to his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls. Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know. Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon. Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols in the hole, then climbs inside.",
    "1114": "Harry runs down a gloomy brick tunnel, disturbing rats that scuttle from under his feet. Rounding a corner, he finds the tunnel blocked by an iron gate. Harry desperately shakes the bars, but they are firmly fixed. He turns and sees a serpent appear behind him, blocking the tunnel. Harry backs against the bars as the gigantic mouth opens, revealing dripping poisonous fangs inches from his face. His grasping fingers find a loose piece of stone, which he throws back along the tunnel. Distracted, the serpent draws back and withdraws its head, then glides backwards and makes its way down a different tunnel. Harry follows it cautiously and watches it gradually slip away and finally disappear altogether. He breathes a sigh of relief, then quickly runs out of the dank tunnel and back to the main chamber. He finds Tom Riddle standing next to the unconscious Ginny and kneels beside her. The serpent rises up behind Harry as something glows inside the Sorting Hat, revealing a silver sword. Harry grabs it and waits as the serpent flows towards the gigantic curved head and starts to climb. The serpent uncoils its huge body out of the water and lifts its head towards him. Balancing on an edge, Harry lashes out with the sword, keeping the creature at bay. It smashes its head blindly against the stone carving; Harry almost loses his grip. The serpent smashes against the stone head again, causing chunks of stone to fall into the water below. Harry clings on with one hand, regains his footing, and climbs up even higher. He stands on the very top of the curved head and swings the sword wildly. The serpent aims for the sound of the slashing sword, and a lucky blow makes contact, but Harry is off balance and drops the sword. As it slips over the curved stone surface, he makes a grab for it. The serpent lunges, and Harry thrusts the sword up through the roof of its mouth. A huge poisonous fang breaks off and buries itself in his arm. He pulls it out quickly. Rearing in agony, the serpent thrashes from side to side, growing more feeble until it falls and crashes lifeless to the ground. Tom Riddle stares in disbelief at the dead serpent, then looks up and narrows his eyes as Harry staggers towards him, holding the bloody sword in one hand and the poisoned fang in the other. Wincing with pain, Harry clutches the wound on his arm, takes a few more steps, then drops the sword and collapses onto the ground.",
    "112": "The platoon begins their journey walking through a rice paddy, standing deep in water, and then it starts to rain. Forrest and Bubba sit in a foxhole as the rain pours down on them. Another day, the platoon treks through the jungle in the pouring rain, and on another day, they shield themselves from the wind and rain as they walk. Forrest holds his hand up to protect his face. Yet another day, Forrest and other soldiers wade chest-deep through a river, with the rain splattering back up and hitting them. The rain continues to pour down on the platoon as they sit in a camp, and Bubba sits down next to Forrest, leaning his back up against Forrest's. One night, some soldiers patrol the area while Forrest lies in a pup tent, writing a letter in the pouring rain, using his flashlight to see. Meanwhile, Jenny steps out of a trailer with a backpack and a guitar, hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy. Forrest writes another letter in his tent as the Fourth Platoon pushes through the jungle and rain until the sun suddenly appears. Suddenly, Forrest's platoon is attacked; a bullet kills the soldier next to him, and bombs explode around them as they scramble to the ground. Forrest crawls over a berm, bullets flying overhead, and pulls off his pack as Lt. Dan lies next to him. Two soldiers fire a machine gun into the jungle, Lt. Dan shouts into the radio, and Forrest starts firing his weapon. Another soldier helps the machine gunner with ammunition until the gun jams and a rocket explodes, killing them both. Forrest covers his head as rockets explode around him, and the platoon runs toward the jungle for cover. They continue running through the jungle, bullets and rockets exploding around them, and a soldier is blown up. Forrest runs past another soldier and out toward a clearing, then turns around and runs back into the jungle. He stops and aims his weapon, looking around scared, and rushes over when something moves. Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain, and Forrest carries him out of the jungle and into the clearing.",
    "1128": "Hermione reaches out and grabs it while they watch fearfully. The snake rears up and attacks, but Hermione's spell stuns the snake. She and Harry disapparate through the window. It is a peaceful winter's day, with a tree-lined river flowing through a countryside white with frost. Hermione fetches water from the river and walks up the steep bank. Later, she sits reading by a smoking campfire with her back leaning against a tree. Harry comes out of the tent, which is pitched behind her. They're both wearing warm winter sweaters, and Hermione has a blanket over her legs. She looks up at him, and he looks around. They both look thoughtful. She hands him Rita Skeeter's book, and he looks at the photographs. She frowns, and with a worried expression on her face, she lifts the blanket and reveals his wand in pieces. Harry sits keeping watch, leaning back against the tree with the blanket over his shoulders, holding Hermione's wand. He takes out the piece of broken mirror and gazes into it. The mirror reflects an empty room, and he drops the mirror onto the ground. He wraps the blanket tight around his shoulders, and behind him, a dim light glows inside the tent. Clutching Hermione's wand, Harry looks deep into the forest. His eyes widen as he spots a light in the distance. It comes closer, glowing ever brighter, taking the shape of a translucent silvery doe. Harry shrugs off the blanket and gets to his feet. He moves cautiously towards it and stops to watch. The doe turns and moves slowly away. Harry follows as the doe stops and glances back, then moves on. The doe trots across a stretch of frozen water with a light covering of frost, and the shape of the doe shrinks to a ball of light. The tip of Hermione's wand glows as Harry steps gingerly onto the ice. As he nears the light, it floats towards him, then sinks below the ice. He crouches down and wipes away the frost from the surface. A sword lies gleaming under the ice. Harry looks around cautiously, then aims the wand. He stands up, and the ice above the sword cracks, creating a hole. At the water's edge, Harry removes his clothes, except for his boxer shorts. He still has the locket around his neck. He treads barefoot and wearily across the frost-covered ice until he reaches the hole. He places Hermione's wand on the edge and submerges his right foot in the water. Shivering, he gazes at the sword, takes a breath, and drops feet first through the hole in the ice. He swims down towards the gleaming sword and reaches out to grasp it. Suddenly, he grabs the chain of the locket and struggles for breath.",
    "1132": "Harry sits in his room, holding a shard of broken mirror. He stares pensively at his own reflection, then sees an eye that is not his own looking back at him. Hegwig is sitting patiently in her cage. Harry packs a rucksack, taking a notebook with the letters RAB written in it, a gold locket on a chain, and a newspaper with Dumbledore's obituary by Elphias Doge. He comes down the stairs, holding his rucksack and Hegwig's cage. The living room is bare. He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs and peers inside. He pulls a cord. The light in the cupboard comes on. Harry steps inside what was once his bedroom and slowly shakes his head. He spots a toy soldier wielding a sword. Harry picks up the metal soldier, and places it in the palm of his hand. He studies it, his face solemn, then puts it back. He opens the front door. Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione are there. Mad-eye Moody, Mr. Weasley, and Kingsley Shacklebolt follow them inside. Hermione has plucked a hair from Harry's head. She puts it in the flask Moody's holding. Fleur Delacour's with Bill, the Weasley twins, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks stand nearby. Moody glares at Fred. He sips, grimaces, passes the flask to George, and starts to shrink. George also pulls a face and shrinks. Mundungus drinks and grows a little. The flask is passed to Fleur, then Ron, and finally, Hermione. They all change physically until each one looks like Harry. Moody retrieves the flask from Hermione, then joins the real Harry. They both survey the six Harry Potter lookalikes. He empties clothes onto the floor. The real Harry steps out of the front door with Hedwig on his arm. The snowy owl spreads her wings and flies away into the night sky. Harry's in Hagrid's motor bag sidecar. Some ride broomsticks. Bill Weasley rides a thestral, a winged, skeletal horse. Decoy Harrys on broomsticks sweep past Moody. Hagrid rides his motorbike up into the air, forcing Moody to duck. Two thestrals zoom over his head. In the sidecar, Harry grips the windscreen as Moody passes on a souped-up broomstick. Lightning flashes through the clouds. Harry clings to the windscreen. Death eaters appear and zoom over the decoy Harrys. They race through the glowering clouds. The decoys draw some death eaters away. Hagrid presses a button. A burst of flame shoots out of the rear, propelling the bike forward. They land on the motorway. Death eaters in pursuit. Harry aims his wand. A death eater crashes to the ground. A caravan veers out of control and tips over. Hagrid swerves into oncoming traffic to avoid it. Still on the wrong carriageway, he heads into a tunnel.",
    "1134": "Lupin sinks onto a chair, his head lowered. George looks solemn while giant Hagrid, his head wedged behind a roof beam, gazes blankly. Harry turns away, his face sad and pale. Later, Ron is asleep in bed. Across the room, Harry is also asleep but dreaming of Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Cameras flash. He sees the locket, the diary, a staring eye, a ring on Dumbledore's finger. Dreaming of Voldemort and the old wand maker, Harry stirs and wakes. Ashen-faced he lies on his back. He stares up at the ceiling. Harry snatches up his wand. His rucksack on his back he secretly leaves the Weasley's house. He starts to stride away. Ron comes out of the house. He follows Harry. Harry stops and turns round. Harry stares at Ron. Ron looks back at the house. Ron steps closer to Harry. The two friends' eyes are fixed on each other. Harry takes off his rucksack. He drops it on the ground. He turns away. Ron picks it up and slings it over his shoulder. They head back towards the house. He reads a headline. In moving picture, Dumbledore closes the massive doors of Hogwarts School. The back of her beaded dress is unfastened. He walks over and stands behind her, hesitating for a moment. She half-turns to him. He zips up her dress. Ginny turns towards him. They kiss. George tiptoes in cleaning his teeth a bandage over his ear. He sticks his toothbrush in his ear. He picks up a cup and drinks. Ginny spots him and breaks away from Harry. George smiles and winks. Harry gently strokes Ginny's arm as she slips away. Looking slightly embarrassed, Harry grins. George gives him a knowing look. Mr. Weasley organizes the erection of a marquis outside the house. The Weasley brothers and Hagrid use their wands to magically raise the huge tent. A tall figure strides towards the house. Hermione and Harry face Rufus Scrimgeour in the living room. Ron joins Hermione and Harry on the sofa. The Minister lays a flat pouch on the table. Scrimgeour takes a document from his briefcase. It floats in front of him opening as it does so. He unfastens the pouch and hands the Deluminator to Ron. Ron unwraps a small cylindrical metal object. Ron presses a switch. The light from two lamps is absorbed by the Deluminator. He switches it off and on again. The light flies back to the lamps. Ron grins. The others look blank. He unwraps the Golden Ball. The Minister holds it out in a cloth. Harry reaches out. He tentatively takes the Snitch. He studies the Golden Ball. Scrimgeour and Hermione both look expectant, then disappointed. Harry turns the Snitch over in his hand.",
    "1136": "Lights come on in the hall. They close the front door. Gray smoke rises from the tiled floor in the long narrow corridor ahead of them. It swells towards them. A ghostly Dumbledore appears. His hand reaches out. The face disappears. The smoke dissipates. They freeze. Hermione steps forward and raises her wand. Harry dreams of Voldemort threatening the wand maker, Ollivander. He wakes from his dream. He's lying fully clothed on a sofa. On a sofa opposite, Hermione's still asleep. Her left hand's hanging over the edge almost touching Ron's hand. Ron sleeps on the floor between them. Harry hauls himself upright. Using the glowing tip of his wand to light the way, Harry mounts a staircase. His shadow is cast on the wall. He turns the handle. Pushing the door open, he stands in the doorway. Light floods in through a dusty window. Inside the room he pulls a cord. Two skeletal bats flap their bony wings. Harry looks around. On top of a chest of drawers he finds a dusty old book. Harry looks back at the book. Hermione enters another room. It's a mess with a mattress falling off the bed. Ron indicates the name of the door. Harry reads the message in the locket. Hearing a noise, they turn towards it. Harry gets up. He cautiously crosses the room towards a door in the corner. Harry yanks it open revealing house elf. Harry holds up the replica. Kreacher stares at the locket. Kreacher disapparates. The Hogwarts Express puffs its way across a barren landscape. In the train, Ginny sits with Neville Longbottom. Death Eaters fly over the engine. A dark figure stands on the tread. He halts the train. A student, Cormac, confronts the Death Eaters as they walk through the carriages. Death Eaters approach Ginny and Neville. Dressed in pink, Dolores Umbridge stands beside Pius Thicknesse. A man is dragged towards the new Minister. Mundungus sells stolen property. He sees a group of snatchers. He scurries away taking shelter in an alley. The reward posters of Harry, Undesirable Number One are pasted on the walls. Hermione plays. Ron watches her with puppy dog eyes. She glances at him. He tries again. Harry stares at the Snitch fluttering in front of him. Hermione joins Harry. He takes hold of the Snitch. The Snitch's wings fold. Harry stares at the Golden Ball. They all look round. Harry and Hermione run past Ron into the kitchen. Kreacher has Mundungus round the head. Dobby clings to his leg. They close in on Mundungus. He sees a photograph in a newspaper on the floor. He picks it up. He puts it on the table. A city street with stone buildings.",
    "1138": "Harry slips inside Umbridge's office. The walls are hung with China plates showing pictures of cats. Harry raises his wand. Umbridge's chair is upholstered in pink. He notices two passive pink shoes placed neatly on the floor. He crosses to the desk. There's a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer on lace doilies. He searches drawers and finds files with photos attached. One is of Mad-Eye Moody with a red cross through the photo. Another is of Professor Dumbledore crossed through in red. The Supervisor turns. Harry emerges from Umbridge's office. Grim-faced, Harry turns and walks away. He's sopping wet. Harry and Ron leave the lift at courtroom level. The man is hauled away by two guards. Harry tugs Ron's lapel. They walk towards the courtroom. From a high bench Umbridge addresses a woman sitting below. Umbridge wears the locket around her neck. Mary sees Ron. Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom. He stays back himself. Yaxley sits watching the proceedings. Ron stands beside Mary. Harry nods. She holds it up. Dementors hover above. Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge. He has spotted the locket around her neck. His wand drops into his hand. Umbridge sees it. Hermione trembles. His face distorts. Ron zaps Yaxley. Hermione grabs the locket from Umbridge. She tosses it to Harry, now back to himself. Yaxley sees them race off. The hovering Dementors chase the group into the lift. They're stopped by the closing gate. Their arms and long-boned fingers reach through the metal grill. They attempt to suck the souls out of the four in the lift. Harry raises his wand. The Dementors are forced back by the spell. The lift zooms upwards. The atrium is busy. There are people upon walkways and others at ground level. A lift arrives. The group look around the atrium before stepping out into it. Hermione and Harry are both back to themselves. Ron still looks like Reginald. Mary clings to him. She takes Ron's face in her hands. She kisses him on the lips. During the kiss Ron shrinks. He transforms back to himself. Mary steps back. The real Reginald appears in his vest and boxers. He sees Ron. Ron turns. Uniformed guards chase Harry. Yaxley arrives in the lift. Hermione and Ron race after Harry. Yaxley barges past people hurling bursts of energy at the trio, narrowly missing them. Harry spins his wand at a pile of posters. The reward posters for Harry Undesirable Number One swirl around the atrium almost engulfing Yaxley. He brushes them aside. The trio reach the corridor. Yaxley aims another burst. The spell disarms Yaxley. Ron grimaces as he runs. He glances back. Yaxley is gaining on him.",
    "1141": "Later, the pace hots up. The hall is jumping. Tiny Professor Flitwick is passed over the heads of the dancers. To Parvati and Padma's annoyance, Harry and Ron won't dance. The four of them sit glumly at the end of the room. Hermione dances wildly with Victor. Ron and Harry glare at Krum. Parvati is asked to dance. She gets up with relief. Padma looks exasperated. Ron spots Krum kissing Hermione's hand. Viktor leaves her. She spins around, her face flushed. Smiling happily, she sinks down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron gives a great sigh. Hermione gets up. She goes to speak, thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off. Padma glares at Ron. Padma gets up and stalks off. Later, Ron tries to reason with Hermione. She wipes away a tear. The boys escape up the stairs. Hermione flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet. Neville is still dancing with Ginny. Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's chest. His hand slips to her bottom. She puts it firmly back on her waist. Disturbed by the bell, crows rise into the darkness. They swoop between the tall towers past one or two lighted windows. Snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in. Asleep in bed, Harry is having a nightmare. He sees the dark cemetery with the winged stone statue. The cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe. Behind it, stands the snow-covered mansion. Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door. Inside the room, Wormtail hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm. The large snake whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair. A green flash. Harry's eyes spring open. Neville appears, his dancing shoes slung around his neck. He waltzes off. Harry smiles. Hermione looks concerned as Harry walks away. Harry looks weary. Harry nods. Cedric gives Harry a knowing smile and goes. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool. He leans back under the bubbles. A mermaid in a stained glass window holds back her long golden hair to watch him. Harry turns to the golden egg standing on the side of the bath. He opens the eggs. He slams it shut again. A ghostly figure appears out of the lavatory. She floats towards him. She dives into the bubbles. Harry grabs the egg. He twists it open under the water. The egg glows brightly. Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it. He bursts to the surface.",
    "1142": "She peers mischievously into the water. Harry attempts to preserve his modesty with some bubbles. Myrtle leans her head on his naked shoulder. In the library, Ron puts the golden egg on the table. He and Hermione leave reluctantly. Harry piles up his books and tidies his notes. Moody leaves them alone. Harry looks at Neville apologetically. At the lake, Fred and George take bets. Neville hands over the gillyweed. Three tall spectator pavilions have been erected in the lake. Harry chokes on the gillyweed. Three of the competitors dive in. Moody pushes Harry in after them. Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions. He clutches his neck. Gills develop on either side like a fish. He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers. He held up his hands as they become webbed. Seamus stares down into the water. Harry suddenly hurtles up out of the water. He somersaults in the air like a dolphin and vanishes again under the surface. Harry kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rocks-strewn bed of the lake. It falls away in front of him into a deep ravine. He dives into the murky darkness, arms held close by his sides. Fish swim beside him as he moves easily through the water. He's wearing shorts and a singlet with Potter written on the back. His wand is in a sheath, strapped to his leg. He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water. He swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him. Harry looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind. Fleur is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose. Her long fair hair streams behind her. Something whips past her face. Fleur certainly disappears, pulled down out of sight. Harry is knocked aside by something as it flashes past. Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed. Harry follows the merperson as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake. Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway. He kicks out strongly with his flipper feet. Tall columns rise around him like an underwater cathedral. He swims past ruined archways, their outline softened by algae and water weed. Four people in black cloaks float upright in front of him - Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair. Their eyes are closed, their face is blank. Unfriendly looking merpeople lurk, ominously close, carrying sharp tridents, and lashing their tails. Harry unties the rope around Ron's ankle. He moves toward Hermione.",
    "1144": "On his way out, Moody gives Harry a long look. The tadpole-like licorice snaps, attracting Harry's attention. He takes a handful. They nip his fingers with their sharp, little teeth. He drops them onto the floor and stomps on them. Behind him, the doors of a cabinet swing open. A blue light glows from a large, stone vase in front of a flickering mirror. Harry slowly walks towards it. Reflected in the mirror, he gazes down into the shining blue bowl. The cloudy surface swirls. Harry sees a glow at the bottom of a deep shaft. He finds himself falling down into a crowded courtroom. He lands in a chair, sitting next to someone he recognizes. The man next to him shakes hands with Professor Dumbledore right through Harry. A disheveled man appears in a cage in front of the judge, Mr. Crouch. Rita Skeeter gasps. Moody aims his wand at a young man hurrying from his seat. Barty is dragged to the bench. His tongue flickers like a snake. Mr. Crouch is transfixed, horrified. Harry falls from the bowl to the floor in Professor Dumbledore's room. He puts his wand to his temple and drops a thread of memory into the pensieve. Leaving Dumbledore's room, Harry hears voices from the open door of Snape's store room. Harry sees the dark mark on Karkaroff's arm. Karkaroff leaves quickly. He shows Harry a small bottle. Tiny Professor Flitwick conducts the school band. The stands are crowded with flag-waving supporters. An enthusiastic, Mr. Diggory runs in, encouraging the crowd to cheer as an embarrassed Cedric enters the arena. Fleur follows. Her classmates perform a cheerleader routine. Draco and his crony support Viktor Krum, who appears with Karkaroff. A concerned Dumbledore accompanies Harry who looks around nervously. Standing in front of a tall hedge, Dumbledore addresses the crowd. They gather around Dumbledore. Harry stands before a narrow opening in the hedge. Mr. Diggory hugs Cedric tearfully. Harry gives Cedric a friendly nod. Once again, Filch lights the canon too soon. Moody pats Harry encouragingly on the shoulder as he tentatively enters the maze. Dumbledore watches him go. Harry looks back towards the entrance and sees Moody pointing surreptitiously to the left. He stares uncertainly down the narrow, misty path. Suddenly, the hedges close together behind him, blocking the way out. Harry swallows hard and follows the direction Moody has indicated. Each long path looks exactly the same. The thick, hewn hedges rise 25 feet on either side. Above his head, he can only see a narrow strip of sky. The intricate maze extends far around him stretching away into distance of mist covered valley. Harry moves slowly and cautiously between the hedges. He turns and looks behind him fearfully.",
    "1150": "A spider lands on a desk, then on a boy's head, crawls up a girl's arm, is flicked by Moody's wand, hovers over Ron, drops into Ron's hair, clamps itself on Draco's face, and hits the glass. Controlled by Moody's wand, the spider hovers helplessly over a bucket of water. Moody carefully directs it to the palm of his hand. Neville puts up his hand, steps towards the table. The spider writhes in agony. Neville looks distraught. His face is twisted with angry. Hermione cries out. Moody lowers his wand, withdrawing the curse. Neville's eyes are tight shut. His face is clammy. Moody places the spider in front of Hermione. She shakes her head. A flash of green light. The spider dies. Moody's mad eye swivels round to stare down at Harry, who looks up at him warily. Moody nervously licks his lips and takes a swig from his hip flask. Harry regards him thoughtfully. Leaving the classroom, Ron follows Hermione and Harry down a circular stone staircase. Moody appears as they spot a sad figure. Neville reluctantly follows Moody back up the stairs. The rain runs like tears down the face of a woman in a stained-glass window. Students splash across the courtyard with cloaks over their heads to protect themselves from the rain. The goblet of fire stands in the great hall. Eligible students cross the circle of light drawn around it on the floor, reach up, and place their name into the blue flame. Cedric Diggory's supporters push him forward. He steps through the circle and puts his name into the stone goblet. Ron gives Cedric an encouraging wave. Fred and George run into the hall in triumph. They each swallow the contents of a test tube and jump inside the circle. They put their names into the goblet. Engulfed in blue flames, Fred and George are flung out of the circle. They both have white hair and long, white beards. They grapple with each other, rolling over and over on the stone floor. Hermione shakes her head, sits on the stone steps, and opens a book. Accompanied by a Durmstrang student and their teacher, Karkaroff, Viktor Krum approaches the circle. With a serious look on his face, he strides forward confidently and puts his name into to goblet. As he turns away, he catches Hermione's eye. She gives him a faint, admiring smile. The students assemble excitedly in the great hall. Dumbledore raises his hand. The flames of the burning torches around the hall gradually die down one by one. Everyone looks expectant. Arm outstretched, Dumbledore approaches the goblet of fire. The blue flame turns red. A piece of charred parchment flutters down into his hand.",
    "1152": "The room is deserted as he starts to read. Turning the page, he finds Rita's article. He crumples up the newspaper and throws it into the fireplace. Sparks fly out of the fire, and the image of a face forces itself through the glowing embers. Harry looks nervously over his shoulder as he hears the sounds of a door. A shadow moves on the stairs, and Ron appears in his pajamas. Ron turns and goes back up the stairs. Harry looks into the embers again, but serious his face has gone. The newspaper starts to burn. Harry reads the headline, then the paper is consumed by the flames. Neville is collecting plants in the lake as Harry opens a book. He waves to Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Harry gets up. Ron whispers to Hermione. She approaches Harry. Hermione looks exasperated. Ron whispers to her again. Ron scowls at Harry as the trio leave. Late that night in the forest, Harry stares at him. They both stop. Hagrid looks around. He hurries forward. Harry puts on the invisibility cloak and disappears instantly. Harry grimaces. Huge flames burst from four enormous crates standing in a clearing. Madame Maxime gapes and moves nearer. Harry throws off the cloak. A dragon breathes a burst of flame. They bar Harry's way. He pushes past. Harry finds Cedric. He takes Cedric aside. Moody watches, unseen. Harry spots Ron. Ron and Seamus stalk off. He drops down from a tree. Draco goes for his wand. Moody turns Draco into a ferret. The ferret is flung up and down helplessly. He puts it down Crabbe's trousers. Moody winks at Harry as the ferret emerges from Crabbe's trouser leg. McGonagall breaks the spell. Draco reappears. Moody chases him off. Moody pulls a face behind her back. Harry follows him. Moody opens the door to his cluttered room. He hobbles painfully towards a chair and sits down. To Harry's surprise, he unfastens his artificial metal leg and places it on a stand. He leans back in his chair. Harry stares at a cloudy mirror. Moody kicks a stool towards him. Harry looks blank. In a wooden arena on a craggy hillside, Fred and George take bets from their fellow students. The Triwizard competitors pace restlessly in their tent as Dumbledore announces the contest. Harry goes to a gap in the tent. She bursts in and throws her arms around his neck. Rita and her photographer. Rita looks Krum up and down. She strokes his cheek with her quill. Fleur puts her hand into the bag and takes out a tiny dragon. She shows it fearfully to the towering Madame Maxime. Krum picks out a dragon. Cedric takes his turn. Harry puts his hand into the bag.",
    "1157": "Harry invades Snape's memories and sees him unhappy, witnessing Snape being humiliated by his father, before returning to the storeroom. Snape, his face twisted with anger, grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers and runs from Snape's room. He hears crying in the corridor and finds the twins comforting a small boy, while Umbridge stands watching them. She goes, and the O.W.L. exams begin. The great hall is set out with long rows of desks. Hermione is busily writing, Ron sighs and looks worried, and Harry watches Umbridge. She stands on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum, her smug smile fading as several students turn to look at the door behind them. Umbridge strides purposefully down the middle of the hall towards the great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look. Umbridge opens the door and a fizzing firework hovers in front of her nose, whizzing into the hall where it explodes in a shower of sparks. Umbridge looks anxiously around the empty hallway. Suddenly, Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks, zooming backwards and forwards, flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering the papers in all directions. Goyle gets a firework in his face, Crabbe a whiz bang up his backside, and another attacks Draco. Filch rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal and his brother flings a large firework into the air. With a flash, the head of a flaming, fiery dragon appears and heads for Umbridge, its mouth full of white hot teeth. She races for the door, the dragon bursts out after her and explodes destroying the hundreds of decrees that Filch has nailed to the wall. The frames come clattering down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building and swoop out over the battlements on their broomsticks, flinging fireworks as they go. Delighted students rush out into the courtyard, applauding the magnificent display. Professor Flitwick is among them looking rather confused. A huge fiery letter W appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride. Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously. Harry's face grows pale and he collapses in slow motion. Hermione sees him fall. Harry is overwhelmed by an image of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Sirius gasps, his face contorts with pain. Harry sees the number 97, the glass sphere, the black corridor, and the blue door. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously and looks at Ron. They enter Umbridge's study. The white cat leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder into the fire. Draco drags in Neville. Umbridge leans over Harry. Harry looks at Ron and Hermione.",
    "1163": "Harry and the other person step into a corridor with shiny black tiles lining the walls and floor. They see Fudge talking to Lucius Malfoy outside the courtroom. Harry nods nervously as the jurors exchange glances. He approaches Fudge while Dumbledore sighs and addresses the jury members, causing some jurors to murmur among themselves. Fudge raises his hand, followed by the Undersecretary with a sickly smile, and others raise their hands as well. Many more jurors raise their hands, including Mrs. Figg, who then makes to scratch her ear. Amelia Bones raises her hand too, and Harry jumps to his feet. Dumbledore has gone, and the scene shifts to King's Cross Station, where Moody and Nymphadora Tonks lead Harry and the Weasley family across a footbridge. A large black dog hesitates beside Harry, then trots into a waiting room and transforms into a man. Harry runs in after him and sees a group photograph of 20 people, including his parents standing beside Sirius. He hands the photograph back to Sirius and walks along the platform crowded with Hogwarts' students and their families. Harry sees the tall, gaunt figure of Voldemort facing him, twisting and flexing his neck. On the train, Harry sits in a corner of the carriage, shifting uneasily and mimicking Voldemort's neck movements. Hermione sits beside him and glances at Ron as the Hogwarts Express speeds along the coast with a plume of white smoke. Hogwarts School sits beside a river running down to the sea as they emerge from the train and Draco Malfoy struts along the platform. Ron holds Harry back, but Harry shakes him off. Outside the station, four girls sit in a horseless carriage, including Cho, who smiles at Harry as the carriage pulls away. Harry stares after it, and as they wait for another carriage, Neville joins them carrying a cactus. Harry turns and sees a strange creature with a horse-like head and long leathery neck. Puzzled, he inspects the animal more closely and notices a girl with long blond hair sitting in the carriage behind it, reading a magazine upside down. They all climb in, and Hermione shifts uncomfortably as they all look confused. In the great hall, Luna and the other students enjoy a luscious assortment of puddings, but Harry has an empty space beside him and looks over at Seamus, who pointedly ignores him. He stops as Professor Umbridge, the former Undersecretary, rises smiling primly, dressed in a sugar-pink suit with matching accessories. The twins are not convinced, but Filch applauds enthusiastically. Harry walks into the Gryffindor common room, where everyone turns to look at him. Ron glares around the common room, then follows Harry upstairs.",
    "1164": "Harry kicks his trunk, causing Ron to be taken aback. Ron then leaves Harry alone, who sits on his bed staring into space, twisting and flexing his neck. Later, Harry tosses and turns in his sleep as veins twist under his skin. He dreams of a black tiled corridor with a blue door at the end, a glass sphere, and a bony hand. Harry wakes drenched with sweat to see Ron watching him with concern. In a classroom, a girl launches a white paper airplane that turns into an intricate paper bird and flutters its wings. Seamus takes a swipe at it, but the bird flies out of reach, soaring around the classroom. Crabbe aims his catapult at the bird, which hovers and then bursts into flames. Professor Umbridge lowers her wand, points it again, and books distribute themselves on the students' desks. She gives a sickly smile, making the students lower their eyes nervously. Searching for words, Umbridge glances around the classroom and walks slowly towards Harry. Later, sitting in her pink office, Umbridge puts three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar into a china cup decorated with pink roses, as cats move around on the china plates on the wall. She stirs her tea, puts down the cup, and touches a pen lying on her desk. Harry opens the door, looking at the plates on the wall, noticing a white cat staring at him from one of them. Umbridge places a curled brown quill in front of Harry, who starts to write with it in his right hand. To his surprise, the words appear on the paper written in red, and he winces with pain. An angry red arc appears on the back of his left hand and then another, as the words appear cut into his skin. Harry looks at the quill in disbelief. Umbridge stands in front of him, smiling sweetly down at him with her eyebrows raised. Harry boldly meets her gaze then blinks, and she leans over him, smiling with satisfaction. Meanwhile, Fred and George try out their inventions, and Ron and Hermione sit beside Harry as he turns a page of his book and shows his right. Hermione looks at the scars, and Harry walks off, leaving her and Ron looking bewildered. Harry's owl, Hedwig, flies away from Hogwarts as Harry stands outside Hagrid's deserted cottage, seeing a large winged creature swoop down into the Forbidden Forest. He wanders alone through the forest and spots a group of horse-like creatures with huge bat-like wings. A girl is stroking the nose of one of them.",
    "1165": "She's barefoot. Harry looks up at the reptilian creature. They see a baby Thestral. She takes an apple from her bag. The baby Thestral squawks. She rolls the apple to the baby. Luna throws down a piece of raw meat. Ignoring the apple, the baby Thestral flaps its wings and gobbles up the meat. Ron gobbles a sausage at breakfast. Harry approaches the table. On the stairs, McGonagall is affronted. Filch hammers in a nail and hangs a decree. Umbridge has been appointed Hogwarts' high inquisitor. Pink suede shoes stalk the corridor. Umbridge interrogates Professor Trelawney. Snape swipes Ron. The twins play tricks with a firework. Umbridge destroys it. Filch climbs a ladder. More decrees. Umbridge smiles smugly to herself. Filch swings his ladder. Students duck. He swings it back. They duck again. Trelawney gapes. Umbridge measures the height of tiny Professor Flitwick as he conducts the choir. Trelawney's eyes look round desperately behind her huge glasses. Umbridge ticks a box and leaves the classroom. Students crowd into the cloisters. Professor Trelawney stands in the courtyard, looking devastated. She sits on a trunk. Filch brings out more of her luggage. Umbridge comes out of the main door and approaches purposefully. Professor Trelawney gets up and bumps into a suitcase. She starts to weep. Umbridge is unmoved. Umbridge holds up a decree. McGonagall comforts Trelawney. The great main doors swing open. Dumbledore appears. The students watch with baited breath. Umbridge smiles a knowing smile. Harry pushes his way through the crowd of students, but Dumbledore has gone. In the common room. Harry turns up the radio. In the fire, his image fades away into the embers. A flash of lightning. Lightning illuminates the room. Hermione looks directly at Harry. Rain streams down the diamond-shaped window panes. The rain turns to swirling snow, briefly forming the face of Voldemort. The sun rises over the snow-covered village of Hogsmeade. The three friends trudge towards the decrepit Hogshead Inn. They peer inside. A goat walks through the bar. Hermione addresses around 20 students. He glances at Cho. Students shift uncomfortably. He sits down. She takes a deep breath. Harry nods. Hermione, Harry, and Ron sit at a table. Walking back to Hogwarts, Harry consults his friends. Harry grins. Umbridge watches from a high tower as they return to school. Filch leans close as she gives him instructions. Neville hurries away from the bullying Crabbe and Goyle. Walking along the corridor, an odd sound causes him to stop. He turns back, bewildered. An intricate carving appears in the stone wall in front of him, and then a large archway. As Neville watches, the carved stone becomes a pair of huge, wooden double doors. The doors swing open, revealing a long room lined with shadowy mirrors.",
    "1168": "Luna's silvery Patronus disappears and the room grows dark. The students look around nervously. A huge mirror cracks and shatters. Nigel peers through a hole in the stone wall behind it and sees Umbridge and her squad. She aims her wand, but Harry pulls Nigel away. The wall implodes, and chunks of stones fly into the room in a cloud of dust. Umbridge beams with satisfaction. Harry sees that Draco is holding Cho, who looks tearful and distressed. Dumbledore winks at Harry, and Fawkes the phoenix swoops down. Man and bird disappear in a burst of flame. Filch climbs a high, tottering ladder, and they read the latest decree. To make more space on the wall, Filch removes a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton. They look up in alarm as Filch tips the painting to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors slides into place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army take their punishment and write without ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills. She sits on the stage facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a long pink robe, and drinking a cup of tea. As the students wince with pain, she smiles to herself with obvious pleasure. Gritting their teeth, Fred and George glare at her. Cho is standing outside the hall as the students come out, clutching their sore and painful hands. Hesitantly, Cho approaches the last person to leave, but he cuts her dead and walks past. Tearful and forlorn, she gazes after him. Hagrid peers through an archway into the Forbidden Forest. A herd of creatures, half-man, half-horse, gallops past. A young giant looms out of the shadows, 10 times bigger than Hagrid. The giant flattens a bird between his huge hands. Gwarp lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. They back away, but he is restrained by a rope tethered to a tree. He towers over them and grabs Hermione. Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione looks like a tiny doll in the giant's fist, but she wags her finger sternly in his face. Gwarp places her gently on the ground. Ron looks at her anxiously. Gwarp searches through a pile of scrap metal and chooses a gift for Hermione, picking up a pair of bicycle handlebars in his colossal fist. He offers them to her, and Hermione takes the handlebars from him. Gwarp looks at her expectantly. Hagrid nods encouragement, and Hermione rings the rusty bell. Gwarp sits playing with the bell and smiling innocently. Harry sees his parents in a mirror and a reflection of his younger self between them. Snape points his wand, and a confusion of happy and terrifying memories flashes through Harry's mind.",
    "1171": "The professors rise to their feet. A Slytherin chaser tosses the Quaffle into the air and sends it through the goal with his broomstick. Twenty, old. Hovering high above the pitch, Harry is following the game anxiously. Suddenly, the Golden Snitch swoops past. Harry speeds after it, dodging the Bludgers which aimed for his head. His broomstick goes out of control. It shakes him violently from side to side. It spins Harry over and over. Through her binoculars, Hermione spots Snape in the professors' grand stand. His lips are moving. She gives her binoculars to Ron. Harry clings desperately to the bucking broomstick. It spins him off. But he manages to grab the handle and hangs underneath, holding on with only one hand. Malfoy and his cronies cheer. Snape is still muttering to himself. Harry grabs the broomstick with both hands. It swings him backwards and forwards trying to shake him off. Ron watches through the binoculars. Hermione reaches the professors' grand stand and raises up the stairs. Snape is still muttering. She pulls out her wand. Crawling beneath the seats, she gives the wand a flick. She smiles as a flame appears. Snape's cloak starts to burn. The professors beat out the flames, knocking Quirrell off his feet. Harry's broomstick suddenly calms down. Quirrell and Snape put out the fire and watch Harry as he manages to regain control of the Nimbus 2000. He climbs onto the broomstick. He zooms off to the Slytherin seeker, who is close behind the Snitch. They fly shoulder to shoulder. The crafty Slytherin barges Harry, trying to knock him out of the way. Harry circles round, then comes back. The Slytherin bully barges him again. The Snitch flips from tower to tower then suddenly changes its course and heads straight for the ground. The two seekers follow, but the cowardly Slytherin pulls out at the last moment as they plummet down head first. The Snitch levels out, skimming low along the ground. Standing precariously on the broomstick, Harry stretches out his hand to catch the Snitch. He takes a step forward. The broom tips up and sends him somersaulting over on to the grass. He scrambles up, clutching his stomach with both hands. His friends watched with concern. Hagrid peers through the binoculars. Harry spits out the Snitch. As Madam Hooch declares the winner, the Gryffindors leap for joy. Giant Hagrid punches the air victoriously. Hermione shrieks at the top of her voice. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall applaud enthusiastically. Snape remains in his seat, expressionless. Standing in the middle of the arena, in his Scarlet and gold cloak, Harry beams with pride and pleasure. As his teammates swoop around the arena on their broomsticks, celebrating their success, Harry holds the fluttering Golden Snitch, triumphing above his head and slowly turns, displaying his prize to his ecstatic supporters.",
    "1174": "He puts a huge black egg on the table. The huge egg shredders and twitches and suddenly bursts open. A strange little greeny grey creature uncurls from the broken shell. Its long black leg slips on the surface of the table. It staggers and stretches spiky wings. The dragon shoots flame. Hagrid's beard catches fire. He puts it out with his over gloves. A face at the window. Back in school. Beside Professor McGonagall, Malfoy smirks. Malfoy scowls angrily. Carrying a lantern, Filch leads the four children out of the school. Hagrid comes out of his cottage. Hagrid picks up a crossbow. A shaft of moonlight shows the way, follow Hagrid and his dog, Fang, along the edge of the forest. Even the huge giant is dwarfed by the tall trees, which rise up and disappear into the darkness above their heads. Hagrid's lamp throws a feeble beam, as he leads them amongst the trees, deeper and deeper into the dark forest. Twisted branches loom out of the darkness, throwing weird and frightening shadows. Hagrid suddenly stops. He bends down, and dips his fingers into a small pool of silvery liquid. The huge giant looks around wearily. They split up. Malfoy raises the lamp, and he and Harry continue along the path, looking around them cautiously. Fang keeps close beside them, then goes on ahead, his nose to the ground. Suddenly, the big dog stops, and lifts his head. The boys catch up with him. A hooded figure is crouching over a large white animal lying on the ground. Harry clutches the scar on his forehead. The hooded figure lifts his head. Followed by Fang, Malfoy turns and runs, still carrying the lamp. In the shadowy moonlight, the hooded figure seems to rise up and hover above the dead unicorn. It spreads its arms wide and moves ominously towards Harry. Terrified, he backs away. The figure gets closer and closer. Harry trips over a twisted tree root and falls backwards. He lies helpless on the ground, as the hooded figure advances. Suddenly, something jumps over his head in a flurry of hooves. It attacks the dark figure, who turns and disappears into the mist. Harry scrambles to his feet and looks up at a dark-skinned centaur with a red beard, half man, half horse. Harry nods. As the centaur leaves them, they look sadly at the body of the dead unicorn. The common room. The boys look blank. Harry is not convinced. Crossing the courtyard. Harry sees Hagrid sitting outside his cottage playing a tune. Cloaks flying, they run towards the cottage. They look at each other. The children run back into the school and into Professor McGonagall's classroom.",
    "1179": "In the middle of the night, a stormy sea lashes a small rocky island. In a lonely building, a stone hut, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are fast asleep in a big double bed. In the room below, Dudley is asleep on a sofa while Harry sprawls on the floor in a sleeping bag. Harry adds some candles and glances at the watch on Dudley's wrist. It's midnight. He blows the candles. A flash of lightning. Dudley wakes with a start. The heavy wooden door shudders. Harry hides in a corner. The Dursleys appear on the stairs. Vernon waves a shotgun nervously. The door falls into the room. A huge figure looms in the doorway. He steps inside, tucking his pink umbrella into his coat. He fits the door back into the frame. Hagrid bends the shotgun barrel. It fires into the rafters. Harry steps forward. He takes a large cake box from his pocket. Hagrid sits down. He points his umbrella at the fireplace and lights the fire. The Dursleys are terrified. Harry puts down the cake and looks at the giant curiously. Hagrid smiles knowingly. He takes out a letter with a wax seal and gives it to Harry. Harry opens the envelope and reads the green writing. Spotting Dudley scuffing Harry's cake, he points his umbrella and gives him a curly pig's tail. The Dursleys shriek with horror. But Harry laughs with delight. He throws open the door. He goes out. Hesitating for only a moment, Harry follows Hagrid out through the door. A busy street in London. Harry reads from a list. Hagrid takes him into the Leaky Cauldron Public House. The Smokey Pub is lit with candles. Harry looks around at the people dressed in old fashioned clothes. The barman spots them. Everyone turns and looks. People shake his hand. A man in the turban. Out in the backyard. He taps his umbrella all around a small metal grill. To Harry's surprise, the bricks in the wall start to move. He stares in amazement as the bricks rearrange themselves to form a doorway. Harry steps through the doorway and into a strange new world. Diagon Alley is a narrow crooked lane hustling with witches and wizards in flowing cloaks and pointed hats. Hagrid towers over them all. They pass tiny shops packed full of fascinating and unusual merchandize. A selection of wizard's cloaks and hats. A pet shop full of owls and cages. An owl sits on a purge outside the shop. A bat stretches its wings above Harry's head. A group of children gaze enviously at a sleek broomstick in a shop window. Harry looks worried. All the clerks in Gringotts Bank are creepy little men with long noses and sharp pointed ears and teeth.",
    "1181": "Harry looks on in amazement as the boy lines up his trolley and disappears through the wall, followed by his identical twin brother. The little girl smiles at him and Harry looks at the solid brick wall. He aims his trolley, takes a deep breath, runs straight at the wall, and finds himself safely on the other side. He pushes his trolley on to Platform 9 and three-quarters and smiles with delight. Beside the platform stands a handsome steam engine. The train steams through the countryside with Harry having a carriage to himself. He sits by the window looking out at the passing scenery. The red haired boy has a smudge of dirt on his nose and Ron's eyes widen. Harry pushes back his hair and Ron holds up a bag of squashed sandwiches. Harry pulls out a handful of gold coins and the boys share the sweets. Harry pulls a face and takes a bean out of his mouth then opens a box marked chocolate frog. The frog jumps and leaps through the open window. Harry sees a hologram on the card and looks again. A rat. Ron takes out a wand. A girl at the door pulls a wand out of her cloak and points it at Harry. His broken spectacles are mended. Harry glances at Ron. On her way out, Hermione looks disapprovingly at Ron. He rubs his nose. The train draws into a small country station. Waiting on the platform is Hagrid, holding a powerful lamp. Wearing black cloaks over their school uniforms, the pupils are dwarfed by the giant Hagrid. Ron gazes up at him in amazement. Hagrid leads the way to the shores of a mysterious pitch-black lake. Four at a time, the children crawl into small, wooden boats, each softly lit by lamps suspended by a pole. The boats start to move. Half hidden by clouds, the moon casts a faint blue light. Mist rises from the water as the tiny wooden boats drift silently across the lake. In the distance, the children see the turrets and towers of a vast castle perched high on the other side. Light sparkles from hundreds of windows. The children gaze in wonder at the huge imposing building. It towers above them as the fleet of little boats glides closer to the cliff on which it stands. Safely disembarked, the crowd of new students follow each other into the castle and up a wide marble staircase. On the upper landing, long, thin fingers tap the stone balustrade patiently. Standing in front of huge oak doors, the tall figure of Professor McGonagall faces the first-years as they reach the top of the stairs. Neville Longbottom picks up his lost brown toad and looks up at Professor McGonagall nervously.",
    "1186": "Behind the shield, a faint light flashes on and off from the bedroom window of a suburban house. The light is flashing from beneath a bed sheet. Harry Potter suddenly emerges from under the sheet and pretends to be asleep. Uncle Vernon, wearing a dressing gown, puts on the light and glares around the room. He switches off the light and goes out. Harry pulls the sheet back over his head. He waves the wand over a spell book. The wand grows brightly. It glows even more brightly. The light flashes again under the sheet. Uncle Vernon looks in again but Harry pretends to be asleep. Harry snuggles down in bed. Daylight. Aunt Marge thrusts a wet umbrella at Harry. She bustles into the sitting room with her bulldog with her. She greets her nephew, Dudley. Harry clears the table. Ripper licks her plate. She gives Ripper brandy and glares at Harry. Uncle Vernon gives Harry a warning look. Her glass shatters. She clicks her fingers at Harry. Harry shakes with rage. Lights start to flash and plates rattle. As Aunt Marge wags her finger at Harry, the tip begins to swell. Her cheeks bulge. Her bottom swells to fill the chair. Ladders appear in her stockings as her legs grow to twice their normal size. The seams on her tweed jacket burst apart. Her neck inflates. The top button of her blouse pings across the room and hits the clock. Vernon and Petunia watch with horror. Dudley goes on eating. Ripper bites Vernon's leg. Aunt Marge rises into the air. The beads of her necklace scatter. She bursts out of the chair. A flying button hits Dudley. A second button knocks him sideways. Marge grabs the tablecloth. She floats even higher and hits the ceiling. Aunt Marge turns upside down showing her bloomers and floats into the conservatory. She bumps against the glass roof. She sails out into the garden. Vernon struggles after her with Ripper clinging to his leg. He grasps her hands. Ripper's still attached. All three are lifted off the ground. Vernon lets go and falls onto the grass. Aunt Marge floats away like a huge balloon. Helplessly, Vernon and Petunia gaze after her. Dudley is still eating and watching television. Harry quickly runs upstairs. Angrily kicking the cupboard. He sits on his bed. He looks at the photograph on the bedside table of his parents dancing happily together. He drags his trunk down the stairs. He points his wand at Vernon. Harry leaves the house dragging his trunk on a small set of wheels. In the distance, Aunt Marge is a faint speck in the darkening sky. Harry walks quickly, breathing hard as he pulls the heavy trunk along the deserted streets.",
    "1194": "A Golden Snitch flutters past, barely visible. Lightning sets a Gryffindor player's broomstick on fire. Harry, wearing goggles for protection from the rain, swoops past the professors' stand. He stays close behind the Hufflepuff seeker as they both spot the Golden Snitch. As Diggory reaches out to grab it, lightning catapults him backwards on his broomstick. Harry peers into the hazy clouds, which loom above him, forming the menacing shape of a huge, black dog. He hovers for a moment until the Golden Snitch appears in front of him. He makes a grab for it but it zooms sharply away. Harry swerves back to follow it. As he reaches out, thick ice begins to form on the handle of his broomstick. He shakes his head as his goggles freeze over. An ominous black shape flaps past, a lost umbrella tossed by the ferocious wind. Ghastly figures swirl towards him out of the lowering storm clouds. Harry finds himself surrounded by hooded Dementors. He twists and turns to avoid them. He is catapulted backwards. A Dementor looms over Harry and opens its great mouth as if to suck his energy. Harry loses his grip on the broomstick and falls, helplessly, down through the clouds. Spectators watch in horror as he hurtles towards the ground. Dumbledore uses a spell to break his fall. Harry is in the hospital wing. He opens his eyes. His snowy owl, Hedwig, flies along the valley. The bird approaches the school in a heavy snowstorm and sails past the clock tower. Behind the clock face, Harry looks down as his friends set off without him to visit Hogsmeade. Footprints appear in the snow. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, grab Harry under his invisibility cloak. He taps the blank parchment with his wand. Harry opens the map. The images disappear. A heavy fleck stone slowly rises. Harry finds himself in the cellar at Honeydukes. Wearing his invisibility cloak, he climbs a wooden staircase. Honeydukes' busy sweet shop is full of Hogwarts students choosing confectionary. Neville's red lollipop is snatched from his hand and flips out into the street. Ron and Hermione are close to a shabby house. A snowball hits Malfoy. Another snowball flies out of the forest. Malfoy and his cronies look around for their invisible attacker. One loses his trousers. Another is swung round by his scarf. Malfoy is dragged by his feet towards the Shrieking Shack. Malfoy scrambles to his feet and runs away, followed by his cronies. Harry becomes visible. Ron and Hermione follow his footprints to the pub, but are not allowed inside. Harry looks shocked. He leaves the pub. Hermione sees his footprints. A group of elves are knocked aside.",
    "1198": "A boy walks through a meadow with his dog. A huge dog leaps a fence and heads for the boy, chased by its owner. The newlyweds dangle their feet in a bath and swig champagne from the bottle. Trim and blonde, she takes a swig. Also blonde, with collar length hair, he leans forward and they kiss, as the snow falls outside. The snow is a dense blizzard. Sun blazes down on a motor cruiser riding on the glassy calm waters of a quiet bay. Crystal blue waters wash the shore of a coastal city. Large houses with pools are neatly laid out amid lakes and a golf course. A palatial hotel backs onto the beach. The beach is crowded with sun seekers. Speedboats throw up foaming wakes on the water. A stone bridge crosses a wide river. A red hatchback is among the traffic on the bridge. The couple arrive at an office building. She hustles him out. Jenny's waiting by the car as he leaves the Sun-Sentinel offices. A 4x4 drives down a suburban street. John walks out of a small neat bungalow and picks up the newspapers, one of which is the Sun-Sentinel. The Grogans read their papers over breakfast. It covers most of the next page. She moves uncomfortably to the sink. John frowns and nods. Sebastian packs a knife. John and Jenny drive up a tree-lined path next to a large pen of dogs. Jenny's blindfolded with John's tie. She pets the pups. The Grogans' old hatchback arrives at the airport. The pup's sitting excitedly on the passenger seat. John watches as he paws at the upholstery. The pup stares at him. A police car drives past. John pulls into the driveway. There's a patrol car and people gathered on the street. He gets out of the car, holding the pup. Marley knocks over a big sack of dog foods. Holding a dust pan and broom, John stares at the pup. Splayed out on his belly, Marley is hoovering biscuits. Marley looks up from his box with big sad eyes. John switches off the garage light and goes back into the house. Marley stares pitifully. John brushes his teeth. John switches off the bathroom light and goes to bed, lying with the pillow clamped to his ears. He gets out of bed and goes to the garage. Tousle-headed John picks up the little pup. He leaves the garage with Marley slung over his shoulder. John wakes up in a cloud of feathers with Marley licking his face. The pup's ripped open a pillow and shredded clothes around the bedroom. John heads for the car in the driveway. He closes the garage door. Marley fidgets anxiously in his box.",
    "1199": "As rain lashes the house, Marley jumps up at a window. More lightning flashes. John arrives at the airport in the pouring rain. Jenny comes out of the terminal sheltering under a newspaper. The rain has stopped as they pull into the drive in the old hatchback. Jenny's holding a stuffed alligator. With the alligator under her left arm, she hauls open the garage door and stares at a scene of devastation. Marley spots some pigeons and struggles away from the two bikini girls. Up scatters the birds, hops down the beach full of sun bathers, and runs along the shoreline with John in pursuit. Marley runs straight into the arms of a guy. The guy's dog hurtles to his side. Later, they're back at the house. With one of Jenny's bras in his mouth, Marley charges again. Burst through the screen door, out into the garden. He bolts he back fence as the Grogans give chase, past a neighbor cooking at a barbecue. The neighbor nods. An older Marley drags Jenny through a hedge. She lands in front of another dog owner. John's glumly making notes and screwing them up again. Jenny, with Marley, joins the other trainers. Marley leaps up. Marley wags his tail, then jumps up at John. Marley tries to run off again. She walks off with arrogant confidence. He sprints away and the trainer reaches for a whistle. Dog stops, turns and looks at her, then bounds happily back. Marley knocks the trainer over and starts humping her leg, as John and Jenny rush to help. John stares at Jenny, then shakes his head. Marley lolls out of the window, ears flapping in the breeze as John clutches his hindquarters. The dog's out of the window, walking on his front paws. Jenny gets out to help as traffic streams past. Arnie reads John's copy and shakes his head. Arnie, glasses perched on his nose, screws up his face. John leaves the glass-fronted office with a grin. He walks through the open-plan newsroom, fists clenched in triumph. He sits at his cube workstation and starts to type on his computer. Marley spots another dog and pairs off with the table. Paws on Jenny's shoulders, he's licking her face. He smiles. John, Jenny, and Marley are at the dog beach. It's a tough one, and he grimaces. Grinning, she pats him sympathetically on the back. They tumble, fully clothed, onto their bed, kissing and rolling around. John picks up a pillow and dumps it on the dog's head. Arnie hands John back some copy. John rummages for his phone. Back home, John lets Marley off the leash. He sits on the bed. He feigns enthusiasm. She goes back into the bathroom as John composes himself, then makes another entrance.",
    "12": "Angela, fully clothed, is surrounded by the other girls as she pulls her uniform open and red rose petals spill out. The high school band plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience claps, including Carolyn, while Lester watches Angela, mesmerized. The game is over, and Jane and Angela exit the gym, while Lester and Carolyn stand at the parking lot edge. Jane crosses reluctantly towards her parents, followed by Angela, and there's an awkward pause before she starts towards the parking lot. Lester stays behind, and Angela smiles, aware of her power over him. A solitary red rose petal falls slowly, and we see Lester and Carolyn in bed, with Carolyn looking determined even in sleep. Lester is awake, and the rose petal drifts into view, landing on his pillow, followed by more petals. Angela, naked, floats above, with rose petals falling around her, her hair glowing and fanned out. She looks down and smiles, and Lester smiles back and laughs as petals cover his face. Jane stares at the floor, then exits the car, laughing, and waves as Angela pulls away. She walks up the driveway, turns suddenly, sensing a presence. Looking at the colonial house next door, the porch light reveals Ricky, dressed conservatively. Jane stares at him, irritated, and he curiously raises his Digicam, videotaping her. She turns and walks away, angry and self-conscious, flipping off the camera, then enters her house, locks the door, turns off the light, peeks through the window, and smiles, her heart racing. Later, Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book, grabs her phone, and dials, standing nervously before he's frozen, unable to speak, hangs up, and exits. Jane emerges from the bathroom with a towel wrapped around her, drying her wet hair, picks up the phone, and notices her address book open to the H page. Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.",
    "120": "Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came. Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He moves behind the palm tree near the walk. A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him. Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly. He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin. Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away. Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him to do it. Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car. The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking. Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion. Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. As he turns in his chair the camera pulls back slowly. The office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over Keyes' shoulder. Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly. Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering. Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer. Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk. They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse. Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort. Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.",
    "1201": "He noses open the plastic bin and tucks in and guzzles water from the toilet. He then trots back into the bedroom and settles himself on his bed, enjoying a scratch before lying down. Heavily pregnant, Jenny stirs in bed. Marley pricks up his ears, then trots to the bedside. She sits up suddenly, clutching her stomach. Marley jumps on the bed and watches as Jenny hurriedly packs some clothes. John lifts the car seat box down from the top of a cupboard. Marley munches open the box. He leaves Marley playing happily with a big chewy bone and hurries out of the house. Marley's still busy with the bone as the sun comes up, and through the day, until the big dog falls asleep on the floor. John arrives home alone. They walk out of the back door onto their wooden decking. John sits wearily on the steps as Marley sniffs around nearby. Jenny's indoors with the baby in a carry seat. Marley jumps up at the table with the baby on it. John gets Marley to sit as Jenny lifts the baby out of the carrier. Marley offers up a welcoming paw. On the pavement, the Grogans' bin is surrounded by chewed empty boxes of baby equipment. John, accompanied by Marley, comes out of the house with another bin bag as the bin men arrive. She jumps to save Marley from the attentions of toddler Patrick. On the beach. John sits with Marley under a palm tree. The big dog sits calmly and watches as a young couple kiss and cuddle on the sand. He notices the dog watching the young couple. He wistfully chews a toothpick as Marley lies down on the sand. In the evening, John and Marley drive up to the house with the headlights on. Marley's looking out of the rear passenger window. From the driver's seat, John looks up and through a window, sees Jenny cuddling Patrick and singing to him. She notices the car, shows Patrick, and waves to her husband, who waves back with a smile. Marley's splayed out on the sofa, watching them. Marley bounds out of the house with John holding his leash. John stops and looks around the night time street. A slim teenage girl is standing by her car in her driveway and clutching her side. She nods tearfully. They drive through a plush neighborhood. He lets Patrick out of his car seat. Marley power slides through the house and into the pool. She's staring into the bathroom mirror. She leads him into the bathroom. There are four positive pregnancy tests in the sink. John half smiles and nods hesitantly. There are golf courses with sand bunkers and most of the houses have pools at the rear.",
    "1214": "A truck of army reinforcements arrives. Rambo gets back on the machine-gun platform. The reinforcements are cut to ribbons in the truck. Rambo fires on the boat. Bullets smash through its windscreen, killing captain and helmsman. A bullet from School Boy decapitates the machine-gunner. On the shore, BN fires a loaded bazooka. The boat is obliterated. Rambo spots the commander escaping up the hill. He leaps down from the machine-gun platform and gives chase. The commander stops, impaled on Rambo's machete. Rambo faces the man. The commander blows out his cheeks and looks up at the big man. Rambo rips the guy's stomach open. The commander drops to the ground and Rambo kicks the man's corpse away with a hefty boot. It rolls away and lies face down. Rambo looks wearily down at the field of battle. From her vantage point with School Boy, Sarah does the same. A couple of straggling troopers scuttle away. Sarah makes her way down the hill. School Boy picks up his hefty weapon and follows her. Rambo also trudges back to the jeep. At the bottom of the hill, rebels buzz about. Smoke billows and some of the foliage is burnt. Sarah looks about her. Rambo lingers at the truck, watching her. Then, he frowns and feels his left shoulder with his right hand, checking his wound. The back of his hand is bloody. Sarah finds Michael crouching over a wounded man. He looks up. She runs to him and flings her arms around him. He has a wound to his forehead, and his face is black with soot and grime. Rambo watches them. Sarah and Michael embrace for a few moments, then he gently pushes her arms away and strokes her hair. He then returns to the wounded man. School Boy kneels over Lewis, and Reese over En-Joo's corpse. Sarah looks up the hill at Rambo. Her face is grimy, and she has a light cut across her forehead. She looks at School Boy, who stares down at Lewis. Lewis stirs a little. She looks at the corpse of one of the volunteers, who has bullet wounds in his chest. Michael looks up the hill and sees Rambo. Wide-eyed and frowning, he raises a hand to Rambo. Sarah's face crumples and she starts to weep. Rambo turns away, clutching his shoulder. John Rambo walks along a lonely road halfway up a hill in Arizona, U.S.A. The hill is decorated with scrubby green grass. Utility poles stretch along the length of the road. Rambo's hair is neatly brushed and his face clean. He wears a pair of dark boots, blue denims and a khaki parka over a black T-shirt. There is a khaki kit bag slung over one shoulder.",
    "1217": "Light appears on the riverbank as Michael's party begins to stir. Lights are seen hanging from the soffit of a distant dock house on the riverside. Michael, Sarah, and the party crouch low in their boat as it approaches the building. A group of pirates sits on a veranda overlooking the river, while the volunteers wear worried frowns. The boat's passage goes unnoticed by the pirates in the dark. Michael glances worriedly at Rambo, whose gaze remains fixed on the pirates as the boat leaves the dock behind. The volunteers move towards Rambo en masse, and Michael steps up to him. Suddenly, a floodlight from a motorboat shines on them, followed by a warning shot as the boat bears down on them. The pirates are armed with a machine gun on a tripod. Sarah pulls on a white floppy hat, and Rambo stands with his arms raised in surrender. The pirate motorboat pulls alongside them, with pirates in vests and bandannas casting ropes with grappling hooks onto Rambo's boat. The hooks catch and lock. A floodlight plays on Rambo's face, and a pirate brandishes a pistol. Rambo throws a switch, turning on the lights, and turns the gun on Sarah. The pirate leader turns his gun back on Rambo. Rambo sees a pistol tucked into the second pirate's waistband, pulls a gun from his pocket, and shoots them. The pirates drop to the deck in slow motion, one of them only wounded. The wounded pirate reaches for his gun, but Rambo stands on his hand, aims, and shoots him in the head, then throws the corpse overboard. Rambo grabs Michael by the throat, releases him, and throws a grappling hook over the side. He and Sarah grab the tiller. She stares at him desperately, placing her hand on his forearm, her eyes wide and brimming with tears. Michael looks away disgustedly as she rejoins the group, who appear very subdued. She sits next to Michael, who holds her in his arms. With a sullen glare, Rambo starts the boat's motor and adjusts the tiller. The boat plows through the river water, the floodlights of the now-derelict pirate boat touching their departing stern as they motor into the inky blackness. The next day is bright and sunny. The boat is steered towards a riverbank with a simple harbor beneath a large, spreading tree. The volunteers stand up, collect their belongings, and begin to disembark. Local peasants act as porters nearby. Rambo watches the volunteers leave, the last of them being Michael and Sarah. Michael rounds on Rambo, then gets off the boat and walks away up a wooden gangplank.",
    "1218": "Sarah lingers and turns to Rambo, her blonde hair tied back in a bunch. On the riverside, Michael pauses and watches them, carrying a small bundle. Rambo wears a concerned frown as Sarah stares at him sadly. She smiles faintly and places a small crucifix on a necklace into his enormous hand. His fingers close over the gift as she stares at him, then turns away and gets off the boat. On the bank, Michael hoists a bulky black rucksack onto his shoulders as Sarah walks up the gangplank and joins Michael. The party march away with the peasant porters, then march inland over the head of a waterfall. Two of the bearers carry a pole between them, from which a large carton hangs. Rambo's boat wends its way back down the river as Michael's party crosses a static body of water bordered by rocks and boulders. A man at the front of the party uses a camcorder. Rambo's boat rounds a headland and comes upon the pirates' motorboat, floating near a bank. Rambo stares warily at it as they pass. A single corpse lies on the deck near the abandoned machine gun. Rambo grips the tiller firmly and guides his boat towards the pirate boat. The volunteers and bearers traipse over the brow of a hill. In the valley below is a settlement overlooking a paddy field. Sarah looks about as Rambo pilots the pirate boat further up the river. His own follows behind it, piloted by one of his men. On the pirate boat, one of the pirate corpses has turned a mottled purple. The boat moves into a riverbank. Rambo locks off the motor and brings the pirate boat to a halt. He grabs petrol cans and rope and makes his way through the pirate corpses. The volunteers approach the village and are greeted by small children and adults alike. The village huts are built in the local style in wood with high foundations. Rambo flips the top of one of the cans, holds it above his head and drenches the machine gun and pirate corpses with petrol. The villagers make Michael's party welcome. Rambo opens up another can and drowns the deck in more petrol. The petrol washes pools of blood over the side of the boat. He throws an empty can into the hold of the boat. He flips open and lights a cigarette lighter. From his own boat, he tosses the lighter into the pirate boat, which bursts into flame. Stalks of rice plants stand upright in a paddy field below the village. Outside a hut, Sarah hands a book to a puzzled child. One of the volunteers gives an oral examination to a woman. An old man plays a stringed instrument.",
    "1223": "A bright white light shines out from the center of a black screen, then the screen lightens to reveal clouds and a blue sky. The light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her, standing on a raised plinth before the cloudy sky. An orange disc surrounded by black revolves like a record on a turntable, and shafts of light gradually form the shape of a running man. The figure becomes smaller and is frozen in the iris of an intensely blue eye, then the image fades to black. A handsome black guy holds a receiver to his ear, covers his eyes with his hand, rocks back and forth, and removes his hand from his face. The silhouette of the man swims the crawl on the surface, with sun glinting on the surface of the water. The man swims to shore, strides onto the beach, and walks up steps from the beach which cut through a garden abundant with colorful flowers and bushes. A long low beach house with white flowers trailing from part of its roof looks out over a patio, the garden, and the ocean. In the house, the man studies himself solemnly in a mirror as he fastens his tie, then sits pensively on his sofa. Before him on a coffee table is a list of names with a typed note attached to it, and the name Ezra Turner has been encircled on the list. In a call center cubicle, a man wearing a headset sits at a computer, Ezra types on a braille keyboard, and Ezra disconnects the call. Ben slams the phone down, looking disturbed by his own actions, claps his hands to his mouth and stares down, blinks, composes himself and lowers his hands. Pacing, Ben stabs the air with a finger each time he calls out a name, and smashes a chair against a coffee table. A list of names scrolls, followed by a rapid montage of items—a newspaper article, a coast road, snapshots of Ben, Sarah Jenson's funeral card. A deserted open plan office in shadowy light, and a cleaner polishes a floor in a brightly lit corridor. Ben sits in a cubicle, typing on a keyboard, and stares at his computer monitor gravely. The name, Emily Posa, has been encircled on his list beside him, and above it, the name Yvonne Bastidos has been crossed out. Ben stares pensively at the details, which include a photo of attractive, dark-haired Emily, and prints out her details. Traffic glides along a sunny freeway, and Ben stares ahead gravely as he drives. On the seat beside him is a file with Emily Posa's details attached to it.",
    "1224": "Ben takes a key from behind an upper hinge of the workshop door and glances over his shoulder at Duke, who sits nearby watching him. He unlocks the padlock and enters the workshop with Duke following him. Ben flicks a switch on the machine and gets tools out of his bag. He sets to work on the machine. Stripped down to his vest, lithe, muscular Ben hammers a pin out of the machine. He undoes a huge knot with an equally huge monkey wrench and fits a new belt on the flywheel. Duke lies snoozing nearby, as Ben reassembles the machine. Ben leaves the workshop with Duke, who escorts him down the side of the house to the gate. He gets in his car and drives off. Ben takes a shower at the motel. Looking troubled once more, he stands beneath the fine jets of water and stares down deep in thought. Flashbacks of Ben running through the night. Ben's face is bloody in the flashback. He stops running and sinks to his haunches. In his motel, Ben sits on the edge of the bath, staring down. He's bare chested and has a white towel wrapped around his waist. A flashback of a bloodied garment. And an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on earth. A dream-like image of Sarah. She's wearing a pink dress, then smiling gently as she looks down at something. She walks away slowly from Ben's motel room bed and out of sight. Ben, dressed, lies on his back on the bed. Ben watches the bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick looks weak and is attached to monitors. His mother is reading to him while a nurse fills in a chart beside them. Ben is lying face down on an examination table. The doctor uses a large syringe. Ben buries his face in a pillow as the doctor extracts the bone marrow from his hip. Later, Ben limps slowly into the motel, where Larry is watering plants. Ben ignores him and enters his room. Ben lies on his side in the motel room bed. An unfinished plate of food sits on the covers, along with documents and handwritten letters. Ben ignores his phone. Ben's face is now stubbly. He's sitting up in bed, staring ahead somberly. Ben lies asleep on his side. His mobile flashes as it rings. Ben's eyes open slowly. He stares at the mobile, which lies beside him on the bed. He hesitates before picking it up, then checks the display and opens the clamshell phone. He puts the phone to his ear. Emily cringes and looks hopeful. She breaks into an uncertain smile. She smiles and puts down the phone. The home nurse gives Emily a questioning look.",
    "1227": "The scene fades to black. In the garden, rain bounces off the abandoned dinner table where droplets plop into half-empty glasses of white wine. A candle flame flickers in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim lie in each other's arms in bed. They caress each other's faces. She stares into his eyes. Tim strokes her arm as he stares into her adoring eyes. Emily plays gently with his ear, then lowers her eyes and lightly touches his lips with her fingertips. Emily stares at him earnestly. Emily looks tearful and puts her lips to his shoulder. A large tear rolls down Emily's nose. Tim hugs her to him. She buries her face in his chest. They kiss. The pulse in Emily's neck jumps rhythmically. Golden light bathes her face as she lies sleeping peacefully. Tim lies beside Emily, watching her closely. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow beside her. She twitches slightly but doesn't wake. The scar on the upper part of her left breast shows just above the sheet. Tim, now dressed in his jeans, stands at her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. Looking troubled, he stares down at Emily. Tim leaves the house by the French windows. He sets off slowly across the dark garden in the pouring rain, then jogs to the picket fence. He jumps over it. Tim runs frantically down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs. Soaked to the skin, Tim bursts into a hospital corridor and strides down it to the nurses' station. The nurse eyes Tim warily. Looking fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the nurses' station, paces a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler. He stares at the floor. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor and walks to meet her. She looks alarmed. Tim raises a hand helplessly, marches back along the corridor and pushes through the double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open. Tim walks out into the night. The rain cascades as a grief-stricken Tim strides away from the hospital. As he walks, he takes his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket and taps in a number. Dan and Michelle lie asleep in each other's arms. Dan reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet. Tim rings off. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone to his ear and drops his head. Tim returns to his motel room and pauses in the doorway. His expression is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts. He turns and stares outside, then closes the door. Tim sits on the edge of his bed, panting. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet and makes a call.",
    "1228": "Ezra is woken by the ringing. He presses a button on a digital clock beside his bed and picks up the phone. Tim hangs up. Ezra, now sitting on the side of his bed in shadowy light, lowers the phone slowly from his ear and swallows hard. In the motel, Tim pulls a large bag of ice from the freezer. He slits it open, dumps it into the bathtub, and turns on the shower. He checks his watch, which is on the side of the bath, then makes a call. Tim covers his face with his hand and nods as he weeps. He rocks back and forth. Sarah admires her engagement ring. As Tim emails a response to the message he received, the Corvette wanders into the opposite lane, narrowly missing an oncoming car. The Corvette spins and collides with a van full of people. The van flips several times, throwing its passengers about like rag dolls. The Corvette Tim was driving bounces and rolls down a steep embankment. The Corvette comes to rest as a mangled heap among bushes. In his motel room, Tim steps gingerly into the bathtub of iced water. He's wearing the jeans and polo shirt. He slowly lowers himself into the tub. He's left a note on the floor beside the tub. Tim recalls a blissful-looking Emily lying in bed with him and stroking his face. He surfaces from the memory and reaches for a plastic bucket on the side of the bath. He pours the contents into the water. The box jellyfish glides through the water and up to Tim's hand. It languidly wraps its tentacles around his forearm and stings him. Tim jolts. His body instantly goes into shock from the poison. As he spasms, he grabs hold of the shower curtain around the bath. Tim's legs kick. A flashback to the accident. Tim hurriedly staggers through undergrowth. He tears up the shower curtain, bringing it and the rail down on himself. Another flashback. Tim lurches toward Sarah, who's been thrown from the car and lies on the dark road. He crouches beside her. Tim spasms begin to subside. In a flashback, he reaches out to touch Sarah's inert, bloody hand. He lies on the road, cuddling her and weeping. In the motel, Tim lies on his back in the tub. His chin sinks to his chest. In a hospital, medics try to resuscitate Tim. Dan is in deep conversation with an official. Emily's pager wakes her. Lying on her stomach, she reaches out for the pager, then raises herself a little to look at it. Suddenly noticing the empty space beside her in the bed, she sits up and scans about. In an operating room, Tim's body is lifted onto a table.",
    "1231": "Ben gets out of his car and admires a shiny BMW convertible parked beside him. Elderly ladies, one on a Zimmer, shuffle down a corridor. Ben passes them as he strides towards the reception window, which is open, and shows IRS ID. A suited man sits on the edge of Inez's bed. Inez reaches for a pad, but he grabs her wrist, then is aware of Ben. She shuns his touch and ignores him. He goes to Ben. Goodman looks awkward and leans forward. Ben stares at him impassively, then nods and cocks his head to one side as he continues staring at Goodman. He straightens up again, smiles faintly and picks up his briefcase. Ben's lip curls disdainfully as they shake hands. Ben enters Inez's room. Frail and white-haired, Inez is lying in bed. She ignores him and merely sighs. Ben gives a kindly smile. She stares ahead, stony-faced. Ben puts his briefcase on the floor. He moves gingerly to a chair and turns it towards her bed. Ben sits down at Inez's bedside. She continues staring vacantly ahead. Inez shifts slightly. Inez, who has straggly hair, remains blank. Inez turns her head slowly to look at Ben. He smiles gently. Inez's face is heavily lined. She stares at Ben pensively, then turns stiffly and reaches out a bony hand to pick up her writing pad and pen from a surface nearby. Inez studies Ben once more, then begins to write something down. He watches. Inez nods and writes some more. Inez looks at Ben wearily. Her bottom lip quivers. She looks away. A tearful Inez glances at Ben, who gives her an encouraging little smile. Inez begins to write again. As Ben reads her words, his brow furrows. He looks dismayed. Inez's face crumples. She weeps. Ben looks deeply moved and raises his clasped hands to his mouth. He hurriedly carries Inez out of the room, and puts her into a wheelchair and wheels her past reception. Ben is in his face. Ben pushes Goodman's head back against a window and marches out. A sunny golf course. A woman in a short, white skirt and a T-shirt gets out of a golf buggy with a guy in chinos and a polo shirt. They walk to a ball. Ben approaches them. They hug. Michelle moves away. Ben looks him in the eye and shakes his head. A network of freeway flyovers in sunshine. Ben drives his saloon. In a hospital canteen, an elderly patient attached to a drip wheels the stand it's on as he walks. Most of the tables, which have vases of yellow flowers on them, are occupied. Ben sits at a table, reading. He looks up from his book and watches a woman with two young boys who are drawing at a table nearby.",
    "1232": "One boy is bald and he's wearing a dressing gown and pajamas. The boy spots Ben, who smiles and nods, then returns briefly to reading. Ben takes a paper cup and sucks on the straw in it, all the while observing the boys and the woman. The woman smiles as she watches the boys. The bald boy glances across at Ben, but looks down again shyly. Behind the boys, in Ben's line of sight, Emily sits at a table by a window. Ben resumes reading. Emily, wearing a short strappy dress over a vest top, approaches Ben's table and glances over at the shaven-headed boy before speaking. He gets out his ID. Ben smiles. Ben puts her files back in his briefcase and leaves with a polite smile. Emily remains sitting at the table. Looking drained, she stares down dejectedly. A blue and white neon sign for the Travel Inn glows in the night. Ben pulls up in his saloon outside the slightly seedy-looking motel. He gets out of the car and goes to the reception window. Ben goes to look through an open door. A pudgy bearded guy spots him and comes out from behind a lacy curtain. Ben returns to the reception window where the guy now greets him. Ben lets himself into a dark room and carries in his cases. He puts his keys on a table and shuts the door. Ben sits on his bed in dim lamp light and takes a book and a file out of his bag. The file appears to be full of newspaper cuttings. Ben opens it and studies the first cutting intently. Beneath, the photos of the seven people killed. Ben watches an ice hockey practice. Two players collide, then fight. Emily puts the phone down. She scans about the room. Emily opens French windows and goes outside. Looking shocked, Emily goes around the side of the house to find Ben feeding Duke. Duke pulls her. Duke pulls. Duke keeps pulling Ben. Emily gets a container out of her fridge. Ben studies documents. Emily looks astonished and stares at him, brow furrowed. He stares down at the table they're sitting at. She fiddles with her collar. He smiles good-humoredly and considers. Once again, Emily looks astounded. Ben grins and looks down. Taken aback, Emily blinks as the decision sinks in. Ben gets up. They share a lingering look. Ben smiles broadly and heads out. Emily ponders. He turns back. Emily walks up to him. He stares at her with sad, gentle eyes. He raises his eyebrows, then looks serious. She stares at Ben and blinks. Ben gives an awkward, white-toothed grin and makes for the front door. They hold each other's gaze.",
    "1233": "Emily smiles and looks down shyly as Ben shuffles. She gives a little wave as Ben steps outside, and he shoots her a last look before shutting the door behind him. Ben goes to his car while Emily watches him through the window. Later, Ben stands looking out from his patio as breakers crash on the beach where Sarah waves up to him. Tears roll down Ben's cheeks as he stands looking out to sea. He then sits on rocks, opens shutters in his beach house, and fingers a rope of pearls while studying a photo of himself and Sarah. After cleaning his beach house, Ben sits glumly among a stack of packed boxes. He drives his car sedately along the wide and winding coast road, which is bathed in sunshine. The motel receptionist, Larry, helps Ben carry gear, and in his motel room, Ben uses a small hose to fill up the large cylindrical fish tank that Larry was carrying. Light from the tank illuminates Ben's face as he stands in the darkness, seemingly lost in thought. A flashback shows Ben as a boy at an aquarium, gazing in awe into a tank of jellyfish with spindly, long tentacles. The jellyfish move hypnotically in the water, the glowing specter-like creatures drifting through the water as young Ben watches spellbound, his palms pressed against the tank. Back in the present, Michelle's husband, Dan, watches a box jellyfish in adult Ben's tank as Ben writes and signs a document. Ben throws a notebook at Dan and taps his own temple. Dan's expression darkens, and he edgily wipes his mouth, then his eyes. He glares at Ben and falters before starting to speak, then paces the motel room tearfully. Ben enters a crowded waiting room full of women and children and stands staring across at a bespectacled middle-aged woman sitting in a glass-fronted office. Her mouth drops open when she sees Ben, and he waves to her and smiles. The woman hurries out to him; it's Holly, who hugs him tightly then steps back. She keeps a photo of herself and Ben on her desk in the open-plan office. Ben sits with her as Holly's eyes glisten with tears while staring at him. He eyes her steadily and smiles faintly, and she considers, then looks at him reassuringly. Later, Ben sits in his car watching a house in a dilapidated area. Connie is cleaning a window of the house, and Ben approaches the window and smiles in at her. Connie opens the front door but not the wrought iron screen door and lets Ben in. A little boy of about eight and a slightly older girl are in the living room, playing cards and listening as Ben sits down, the children listening as they play.",
    "1234": "He nods towards her ribs. She hurries to the children, escorts them out to their room, then returns. Connie looks petrified. She slams the door on Ben and locks it. Ben pauses outside, facing the door dejectedly. After a moment, he leaves the modest clapboard house. Ben cuts off his brother. In his motel bathroom, Ben lies fully clothed in a bath that is too short for him. He tries to wriggle down, but his head remains well above the level of the bath. Emily is at home working at her kitchen table. Documents are stacked on the small table. Emily is making notes. She studies her pad thoughtfully, checks a document, then searches through more documents. She scribbles a number out on her pad and encircles another number. Looking down forlornly at the documents before her, Emily sighs and opens her Filofax. She takes out Ben's business card and studies it. A doctor in a white coat enters a hospital ward. He approaches the ice hockey coach and Ben. The doctor goes to Ben. He shakes Ben's hand and leaves. George returns Ben's kindly stare with a slight smile. In another hospital room, Ben makes a call on his mobile. Emily is drying up in her kitchen. Ben holds his mobile to his ear. Ben stands looking distraught, then closes his mobile. Ben sits in deep, gloomy thought. A nurse comes to get him. She goes. Ben stares down gravely. Ben raises his eyes and stares ahead, his face etched with anguish as he remembers. A man and a woman's hand in bright light. Their fingers entwined and they caress each other's skin. Lying in bed, beautiful dark-haired Sarah smiles up at Ben beside her. Metal debris spins and scatters in slow motion. A woman is tossed about. A van flips on a dark road. Ben comes to on his motel bed. He's lying on his stomach and looks woozy. A hand comes from behind him and gently strokes his cheek. The figure of a dream-like Sarah gradually lies back down. Ben is alone in bed. His mouth hangs open loosely. His eyes blink sleepily. Emily's neighbor is gardening when Emily walks up to her with Duke on a lead. Emily walks on slowly past her neighbor's profusion of colorful roses and begins to fight for breath. Emily looks faint. Duke bounds into Emily's garden. Emily blinks, and walks towards her steps. Emily falls flat on her face on the path. She's motionless. Her eyes are closed. Ezra Turner uses a long, white stick to feel his way down a wide and long flight of stairs. Out on the street, Ezra feels his way along the pavements with the stick held out in front of him.",
    "1236": "Ben stirs and sits up. A doctor enters, and Dr. Briar sits on Emily's bed. Emily nods and is handed a pager. She takes a deep breath, looking down. Dr. Briar strokes Emily's hair, gives her a reassuring smile, and leaves. Tears roll down Emily's cheeks as she puts a hand to her mouth. She takes Ben's hand, and he looks on sorrowfully as she presses the back of his hand against her forehead and weeps. Ben walks Duke on a lead past the Travel Inn reception, and Larry sees them, coming out after them. Ben enters his room, leaving long-haired Larry outside, looking indignant. A small fish swims up into the tentacles of the box jellyfish in Ben's aquarium, is immediately partially paralyzed, and drawn up towards the jellyfish's body. Ben sits on his motel bed, watching, and slowly reaches for his mobile beside him. Connie's face is bruised, and Ben hands her an envelope. She takes it and nods. They're asleep in the back of her car. Connie drives along the coast road with the children still asleep in the back. She heads down the leafy drive to Ben's beach house, pulls up, and looks awestruck. Connie tentatively enters the house with the children. They stand in the doorway for a moment, then the girl sets off to look about. Connie pulls her back. The kids run to a window to look out. Connie and the kids enter a bedroom and look about in wonder. They all jump up and down on the bed. Mother and children run along the deserted, sunny beach. In the house, curtains sway in the breeze as Connie sits reading a letter. She considers, looking overwhelmed, and puts her hands to her mouth. Connie holds a pen, her hand hovering over a document, then she signs it. She looks out over the ocean and is silhouetted against hazy, golden light. Ben escorts Emily as a nurse pushes her out of the hospital in a wheelchair. They go to his car, and he opens the door for Emily to get in. Duke's in the back. He fastens her seat belt. Emily grins, and he stares ahead. She gazes at him and smiles, then lightly nibbles her nails. Ben pulls up and turns to her awkwardly. His eyes dart about as he thinks, then he eyes her firmly. She stares at him, puzzled, studying him through slightly narrowed eyes. Emily stares at him expectantly, opens her eyes wide, and furrows her brows. Ben meets her gaze blankly. Emily looks down, considers, then undoes her seat belt. She shoots him a disdainful look and gets out.",
    "124": "Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone, having hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more comfortably. The camera moves slowly towards the davenport where Neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table, smoking his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been sitting fairly close to him, but she gets up slowly and crosses to her raincoat, lying over a chair. Neff does not answer, looking at her slowly, almost absently, then gets up and grips her arm, his fingers digging into her arm, and kisses her. They reach the door, Neff opens it, and Phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white, then goes quietly. Neff watches her down the corridor, slowly closes the door, and goes back into the room. He moves across to the window and opens it wide, standing there, looking down into the dark street, the rain drifting in against his face, motionless. Later, Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone, a used record on the desk next to him. In another scene, the checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola, Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair, his coat and tie over the back of the chair, the evening paper lying tumbled on the floor beside him, a drink in front of him. Neff sits in another chair, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair, holding his rate book partly open. Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue, Lola listens without much interest, looking down at her wristwatch. Phyllis gets up and starts to go. Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink, Neff takes two blank forms from his briefcase, Phyllis watching closely. Neff takes out his fountain pen, unscrews it, and hands it to Mr. Dietrichson who puts on his glasses, signs the supposed duplicate, and grunts. Neff and Phyllis exchange a quick glance, Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications off Dietrichson's lap. Dietrichson pours more whisky into his glass, tries the siphon but it is empty, gathers up his coat and tie, picks up his glass. Neff zips up his briefcase. Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway, Phyllis leads the way, and Neff goes after her, his briefcase under his arm. Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff behind her.",
    "1248": "She follows their instructions and stashes the dry cleaning in the closet on the left, then shows the book. They giggle as Andy creeps upstairs. She reaches an upper floor and comes across Miranda and her husband. They catch sight of Andy who's trying to creep back downstairs. Miranda glowers at Andy, who's like a rabbit trapped in the headlights. She leaves the book on the top step and hurries away. Emily grabs Andy's arm and pulls her into a side room as she arrives for work. Emily points to Miranda's office, and Andy reluctantly goes in there. Andy smiles nervously and heads back to her desk. Miranda answers her mobile. Andy sets a tray down on Miranda's desk and sprinkles herbs onto Miranda's steak. Emily runs to fetch them. Emily has Miranda's coat and bag for her as she leaves. Andy carries the dishes into a side room and throws them into the sink. She calls Nate. Andy stands on the corner for a moment, in a dark green dress and gold accessories, then runs across the busy street. She runs around the corner and races up to the St. Regis, where a doorman in a morning suit greets her. She finds Christian sitting at the bar. She takes the manuscript. At the appointed hour, she puts a hot coffee and the manuscript down on Miranda's desk. The twins are reading them. Miranda turns away in her swivel chair and Andy walks out with a smile. Once Andy's gone, Miranda turns back to stare after her and snatches up the coffee. Nate gets home to find Andy painting a ball to look like a planet. She hugs him. He shakes his head. A black camisole. He pulls her into a passionate embrace. Nigel and his team are on a shoot by a lake in Central Park. The models are all in animal print outfits and stylized animal masks. There's a man with a live snake. Andy finds Nigel vetting one of the models. He leaves Andy thoughtful. Miranda's in a meeting with her senior members of staff, including Nigel. Emily has a cold. She comes in, hands something to Miranda and goes. Emily goes back to her desk. Mouth shut. Andy is on her way out of the building when her phone goes. She's back in Miranda's office with Emily. Andy nods. Albums. Nigel has a long black gown. City lights sparkle as Andy is driven to the benefit. Andy gets out of the car looking stunning in a chic black evening gown, with her hair swept up and adorned with white flowers. Andy spots Nigel talking to reporters. He spots Andy and gives her a warm smile. She winks back and makes her way back past the press, along the red carpet and up the stairs and towards the entrance.",
    "1250": "She stands and stares at Andy with a vaguely pleased smile. Andy nods and holds her hand out to receive the coat, but Miranda tosses it and her handbag onto Emily's desk and marches into her office. Andy stares at the coat, which has been slung over Emily's monitor screen and sits stiffly down in her own chair. Miranda comes to the door. Andy reluctantly picks up her telephone receiver and calls Emily who's running down busy streets with some big bags. Emily is hit by a taxi and rolls onto its bonnet. The scarves flutter around her. Andy waits at the hospital, looking sheepish. Later she's with Emily, who's lying in bed with a broken leg and some cuts and bruises. A man comes in with a dinner tray. Emily tucks into a jelly pot and some bread. Andy stands up and grabs her clutch bag. Andy's at a gallery show that Lily's curated. Lily leads Doug off and Andy checks out the art, standing alone to admire the floor-to-ceiling, blown-up black-and-white photographs of street scenes. Christian is at the opening too. He spots Andy. Andy closes her eyes as rugged, fair-haired Christian kisses her cheek before leaving. Lily is seeing the kiss from across the room and walks off angrily. Andy tries to catch up. Nate follows Andy out. He stares at Andy, who gazes back then glances aside. Nate nods, then turns and walks away. He turns back. Nate walks off. Swallowing her tears, Andy takes the call. An aerial view of Paris by night. The Eiffel Tower alive with sparkling lights. Andy is sitting in the back of a chic, chauffeur-driven car as they travel through the Paris streets and among the Champs Elysees. She gazes out off the window, wide-eyed with excitement as they pass the city's grand buildings, shops, and hotels and the imposing Arc de Triomphe. Miranda occasionally glances over her spectacles at the view. Andy is sitting behind Nigel and Miranda, who are in the front row for the Valentino show. Models in an array of stunning gowns sashay down the runway as cameras flash. Nigel whispers in Miranda's ear. Andy's in the second row for another show and leans forward in her seat, as the models parade up and down in flamboyant evening gowns. Now, Andy's at the Azzaro show, where dresses in a monochrome palette are being shown. Models and celebrities mingle backstage at the Valentino Show. Miranda talks to Valentino. Andy follows Miranda and Nigel as they head into another function past the press pack. Miranda poses for photos. Christian is close beside Andy as a TV journalist collars Nigel and Miranda. They're photographed. Andy hurries after Miranda. Later, Andy enters Miranda's suite carrying some boxes.",
    "1254": "A guy walks onto the stage. He's around 60 and tanned with white hair. He smiles at his adoring fans. Even Carl smiles and claps. Carl holds up his hand expectantly and then nods knowingly. Everyone else claps. He glances around. A spotlight picks Carl out. Carl smiles awkwardly. The audience points at him. Terrance slips off his shoes and sprints down the aisle. He reaches Carl and grabs a chair. He sits facing Carl. Someone gives him a mic. Nick waves. Carl takes a sharp breath. He presses the mic against Carl's nose. Terrance lowers the mic and edges closer to Carl, who inches backwards. He hits Carl with the mic. Carl furrows his brow. Transfixed, Carl stares at him. Terrance stands and yanks him up. Terrance throws Carl down. Nick catches him. His eyes bulging, Terrance raises his arms in the air victoriously. He strides back down the aisle towards the stage. Carl laughs and cries alternately. He claps with the rest of the crowd. Terrance stands on the stage and raises his arms. Some of the audience stand. Nick puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle. Carl and Nick amble along outside the conference venue. A guy smiles at Carl. Carl grins and Nick heads off. Carl frowns. Carl and the vagrant guy get into Carl's car by the door. Carl stares ahead pensively. He takes his phone out and hands it to the guy. Nick gives Carl the thumbs up and slams the car door shut. The vagrant dials on Carl's phone. They drive up a dark road into Elysian Park. The guy's on Carl's phone. Carl smiles wryly. He pulls up beside some trees. Carl takes his phone back. His brow creased, Carl reaches into his pocket. He smiles. He pulls out some bank notes. He offers the guy all his money. The guy has to yank it out of Carl's hand. Carl smiles and waggles his finger. The guy jogs off and dives through a hedge at the side of the road. Carl nods pensively, then reverses his car. He turns the car around. It splutters and stalls. Carl's walking. Carl jogs along a dark road through the park. Carrying a jerrycan, he reaches a garage. He glances over at the garage shop, which is closed. He saunters over to a pump and swipes a card in it. He takes it out and rubs it on his arm agitatedly. He swipes again. It asks if he wants credit. A scooter careers down the road and turns into the garage. Carl turns to look at the pretty dark-haired woman on the scooter. She gets off and undoes the strap on her blue helmet that has eyes painted on it.",
    "126": "She snaps the bag shut. He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket. She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her. She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to Phyllis again. He goes off. She stares after him. He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate book, making a quick telephone call. Keyes enters with some papers in his hand. The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs the phone and answers. Neff picks the phone up and answers. Phyllis is on the phone. Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up and down. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. Neff on phone. He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. Neff on the phone. Neff gets up from his desk. He punches his stomach with his fist. Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed. He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm. Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement. There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm. He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket. Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these.",
    "127": "Neff, wearing a blue suit and a hat pulled down over his eyes, goes down the stairs; some windows are lit. He approaches cautiously, looks around, and slides open the garage door before closing it behind him. Faint light comes in at a side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in, and closes the door, the dark interior of the car swallowing him up. Phyllis drives on, staring straight ahead with her teeth clenched. The station is visible about sixty yards away, with ten or twelve cars parked diagonally and not crowded. The train is not in yet, but there is activity around the station, including passengers, redcaps, baggage men, and news vendors. The Dietrichson sedan drives into the shot and parks in the foreground, both front doors open. Phyllis gets out, and from the other side, crutches emerge, and a man, seen from behind and apparently Dietrichson, climbs out awkwardly. Phyllis takes out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat, rolls up the right front window, and closes and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door, takes a last look into the dim interior, and then she and the man walk slowly to the end of the station platform and along it toward the station building, Phyllis walking several steps ahead. The camera follows them, showing Phyllis clearly but not the man's face. Phyllis nods, and they continue as the train's noise is heard, and its lights are seen coming into the station and stopping. Passengers move forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and overcoat, and Neff, still a little behind her, come towards the camera. A redcap sees them, runs up, takes the suitcase and overcoat, and leads them towards car number nine. Neff hangs back, keeping his head down. The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps, the conductor checking tickets. The redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into the shot, and the conductor and porter move to help Neff on his crutches.",
    "1283": "Stunned people pick themselves up off the ground. The vast metallic-skinned robot stands immobile, the sphere swirling in light and vapor behind it. The visitor's body is rushed to a medical facility. It's on a covered gurney, with Helen accompanying it. A sarcophagus-like gurney is wheeled to a prefab hut in a hanger. The protective cover is unsealed. Mike looks baffled as Helen glances at him. His scalpel cuts into the patient's gray, gelatinous skin. The gray skin is coming apart as the surgeon drops the bullet into a sample tube. Helen slowly shakes her head. The surgeon, wearing a suit which even covers his feet, drops lumps of blubbery flesh into a basin. On the operating table, the naked slime-covered body of a man curls up into a fetal position. Mike and Helen stare in disbelief. The patient lies under a protective tent attended by a technician. Helen enters the room, descends three steps from the gallery area where she was watching, and cautiously approaches the tent. She peers in and sees the man's eyes fluttering. The patient is thrashing around inside the tent. Mike comes in and checks a monitor. The Secretary's chopper touches down at Fort Linwood. The being is lying on a gurney wearing gray hospital pajamas and an oxygen mask. The officials stand at a window overlooking the room. Watched closely by Helen, Mike removes the oxygen mask and offers the being a cup of water. He takes it and draws it shakily towards him. They all watch him intently. The Secretary takes a step towards him. He uses both hands to steady the plastic beaker. They all stare. Regina glances at the scientists. Helen steps forward to help him put down the cup. He looks just like the climber from 1928. His head swivels towards her. She enters a storeroom with shelves full of vials of drugs, leans back against the door and composes herself, then takes a hypodermic in a sealed packet from a glass cabinet. She puts it in her pocket, then scans the shelves. The agent hands her a vial. She pockets a vial of saline solution, goes to the syringe cabinet and opens, then closes the door. She turns and holds up the syringe packet for the benefit of the suspicious agent. Jaw thrust forward, Regina eyeballs Klaatu. Having swapped the two vials, Helen approaches him. She rolls up his sleeve and jabs the hypodermic into his arm. The Defense Secretary watches dispassionately, then turns away. His dark eyes stare at Helen. Three military policemen surround Helen and escort her from the room. Klaatu glances down at his arm as the agent from the drugstore comes in. They eyeball one another.",
    "129": "Godse's face is tense, his movements dangerous, unlike those around him. He glances at two policemen absorbed in their own gossip, then looks back at another Tonga pulling up behind his. Two young men, Apte and Karkare, meet Godse's gaze, giving a sense of imminent danger. They descend from the Tonga, pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. An elderly man, Prakash, with a short, close-cropped beard and sunken flesh, sits alone in the shadows of a stationary Tonga, watching. Apte and Karkare look back at him. Prakash gives the slightest acknowledgment, then lifts his eyes to the gate. Godse hesitates before approaching two gardeners nonchalantly flanking the entrance. He stiffens, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at Prakash's stoic face. Prakash's gaze is firm and unrelenting. Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into a group going through the gate. A crowd is gathering, filling an area leading to a pavilion—some devout, some curious, some eager to be near the great man. Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying behind, their movements sly and wary. Through the crowd, Gandhi is seen distantly, then clearly at the last moment, smiling, exchanging jokes, and greeting people, his hands on the shoulders of two young women supporting him. The camera moves closer, always from Godse's point of view, but Gandhi is half obscured. Godse slides to the front rank, his breathing short, perspiration around his temples. For an instant, Gandhi is seen close from Godse's point of view, a few steps away, turned to speak to someone, Manu half obscuring him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face, then moves boldly into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands. Ignoring her, Godse's nerves even more taut, he joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.",
    "1290": "Students bustle into the classroom as the teacher, Mr. Tinker, tries to maintain order. Juno walks to her desk and sets down her bag, looking up to meet eyes with her longtime lab partner, Bleeker. Meanwhile, another girl lab partner dramatically stalks off. Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper showing a distraught teen girl clutching her head. She smacks the phone a couple of times. A health teacher, in slow motion, puts a condom on a banana. Paulie's face is shown at the moment of his deflowering, comically wide-eyed with shock. Juno, her father Mac, her stepmother Bren, and Liberty Bell sit at a typical kitchen table, eating dinner. Mac shovels food while chatting about his day. A pile of neglected cacti fester in a corner of Juno's room. Bren cuts up Liberty's food diligently, her brilliant nails holding the silverware. Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog and is seen in her nail salon, chatting up a customer in her strong city accent while applying a fresh coat. Liberty Bell pours bacon bits onto her dinner. Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic, recognizing the protester as a classmate, but continues on and pushes open the clinic door. The receptionist sits behind bulletproof glass. Juno flashes her best jazz hands. The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow, arranges paperwork on a clipboard, hands it to Juno with a pen, and holds up a fistful of purple condoms from a jar. The waiting room is semi-crowded with pregnant women, teens, and ill-behaved children. The receptionist points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno scans the ad, which contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. Paulie's bedroom window is shown with childish curtains and the light on inside. Bleeker lies on his car-bed in his track uniform, listening to an LP and staring at Juno's yearbook photo with a sloppy, handwritten message from her. Bren and Mac are speechless as Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings. Bren looks alarmed, and Juno hastily tries to make the situation sound more legitimate. Music plays as sparse images of Vanessa Loring's hands preparing the house for Juno's arrival are shown, including sprucing a vase of flowers.",
    "1292": "He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks. Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered that her baby might have a father. Mark swivels around slowly on his desk chair, surprised. Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling CD's. Mark mouths along with the lyrics. Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up. We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore. A door suddenly slams upstairs. Juno jumps up and rushes out. Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. She holds the ultrasound up to show Vanessa and drapes her arm around her. Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. A beat as Bren absorbs this. Juno heads to the urn by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into the urn. Juno parks her Previa on the street. Bleeker's mom answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down to Juno's middle. Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed. Bleeker smiles faintly. He nervously cracks open a container of orange Tic-Tacs and pours them into his mouth. Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker. Bleeker is visibly relieved. Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected. The house is covered in fresh snow. The walls are primed slate gray. Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall. Mark stares at the wall, looking lost. Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel. She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them, appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse. And one of the women is Vanessa, looking vaguely detached. They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children. Juno tries her best to look enthused. Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces. She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach. Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby. Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly. Mark drops his head, dejected. Mark instantly smiles. Smiles. CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food. Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table. Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch. Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way.",
    "1293": "Juno illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach while Keith, the teacher with a Wild America beard, talks to some science kids in the background. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. Meanwhile, Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno, clearly affronted and belly leading the way, marches up to him. A girl, obviously Katrina, strides past with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno. Juno starts to walk away, picks up her backpack dejectedly, and slides it over her shoulder. She's about to walk away when she climbs ungracefully into the van. Inside, Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website with the blank expression of a bored obsessive. He breaks into a grin and opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up, holding a stack of CDs. He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house. The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered, unfinished, and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb. Juno examines the comic and sees a battered portable CD player in the corner. She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly. They sway slowly to the music, Juno's belly bumping up against Mark. Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. Juno backs away. Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl. Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark. Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased nursing pillow. It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. She rushes toward the door but halts, looking totally betrayed. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying. Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices, sighs, and looks defeated. Vanessa and Mark look over and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict. Juno runs up to her car sobbing. It's quiet after the storm. Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant. Meanwhile, Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar, playing a theme that we will soon recognize. Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. After a beat, she begins to gather herself. She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something.",
    "1295": "Bo finally looks at her father and smiles softly. Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE. Merill picks up Bo and rushes through the crops. He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms. Merill puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan. The ten-year-old boy looks deep in thought. Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's looking straight at him. Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer. Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his face. Graham is forced to look to his right. Graham sees something. Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet. He starts moving forward towards something. He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a clearing. Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center. Merrill, Bo, and Morgan follow him. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL. They are clearly agitated. Graham turns off the phone. He turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds. There is a LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles. Graham looks at the majestic dog. It's shivering. Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. A police officer stands on the other side of the screen door. OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows. Graham stares at Officer Paski. Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill. He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, before walking over to Houdini. Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. She moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table. Takes a tiny sip of the water first. She stops. She holds the glass out to Morgan. He drinks. The two children sit down in the grass with the dog. Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl. Houdini just sits staring at them. He is not shivering. He is unnaturally still. Bo pushes the bowl closer. HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL. The children turn white. Bo stands up. Houdini crouches down. The German Shepherd trembles. His body tightens. He's about to leap. Officer Paski stands up. He turns back and stares in the direction of the house. Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard. They stop cold when they look in his direction. They begin a slow walk towards him. Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.",
    "13": "Jane picks up the address book, frowning. We're across from Jane's window, looking in. She speaks into the phone, but we can't hear her. Barbara Fitts stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. Ricky enters. Startled, Barbara turns to him. As she attempts to serve him bacon, Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal. The Colonel and Barbara look at each other, alarmed. The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up. The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS. Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia. The Colonel stares at them, suspicious. The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel. The Colonel looks at them, confused. Then it dawns on him. The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the passenger seat, Ricky is using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook. The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply. The Colonel's eyes flash angrily. A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he realizes a response is expected from him. Ricky sighs, then looks at his father. The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers. Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations. Close on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns of numbers. Jane and Angela are standing with two other teenage girls. The two teenage girls move away from Jane and Angela. The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile. Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her. He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off. Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it. The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; Barbara just stares. The Colonel chuckles at a joke and startles her. The three of them stare at the TV, like strangers in an airport. We follow them as they pass a sign that reads. Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres. Carolyn's jaw tightens, then. She drags Lester toward a silver-haired man and his much younger wife. We recognize the man as Buddy Kane, The Real Estate King. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in. She smiles her most winning smile at him.",
    "1301": "Graham stares at his view of the floor, sensing something's wrong. He then looks at his family huddled on the couch, takes in the news as he moves to the stairs, and takes a seat on the second to last step, obscured by the balusters. The words hang in the air as he sits quietly. All four family members put their hands in the air, then lower them and sit in silence. Merrill stands and leans against the wall, and everyone sits quietly for a moment. Merrill glances at Graham, who turns and looks at Merrill, and they stare at each other quietly, having a conversation without words. The sink is piled with pots and pans, seeming like every utensil and dish in the kitchen was used. One side of the dining room is lined with windows that have been boarded up, and the table is set with the Hess family around it. Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway, and Graham watches as both his children cry at the table. He takes big scoops of every dish, piles it on his plate, digs his fork into the pile, starts to shove it in his mouth, and swallows. Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the children's bedroom door, while the master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it. Graham is inside his bedroom, walks to the window next to his bed, the same one looked out twice before, and gazes onto his backyard. His eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness. He moves closer to the glass, watching the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind, then backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom. He turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in the hall, moves out into the hall, and shuts the bedroom door behind him. Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame. Graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood, glancing to his right as he works, seeing Bo and Morgan standing together at the top of the stairs, Bo holding Morgan's hand. Graham keeps hammering as he speaks, then stops hammering while Merrill keeps going. Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment, then looks at his daughter quietly, brushing the hair out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up. All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors, and Merrill puts down Morgan.",
    "1308": "David gets startled and puts back the clippings, stuffing a new one inside with them. He replaces it back on the top shelf and leaves the closet. He opens the door to find Audrey standing in the darkened hall. Audrey nods and David stares at his wife. She starts crying, tears rolling over her very affected face. She tries to wipe them away but there are too many. Audrey nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her disappear into the shadows. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture-perfect blue sky. A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are ripping tickets. David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards. The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways. David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is wearing an Eagles uniform. The walkie-talkie on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip and listens. David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks back at him and continues walking. David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles. David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him. Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles. The green army jacketed man moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnstile. David eyes him. Fifteen people away. Ten. The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium. An unlit arched concrete passageway. The sunlight from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself. David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket. Elijah stares at David. David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah. David's walkie erupts with noise. The two men stand very still in the tunnel. David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder. Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of the tunnel. We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every corner and hard surface has been safeguarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of his car in the parking lot of the stadium.",
    "131": "He, wearing a prison uniform and a bandage on his head, turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi, then takes his soup from Khan. Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages and the defiant, determined faces, then is distracted by a phalanx of guards pushing their way through the prisoners. The prisoners move back resentfully, but their glances reveal who Gandhi is, and the prison officer's eyes fall on him. Gandhi, now manacled, is marched down the pavement before two guards, with the prison officer striding in front of them. A tall civil servant, waiting for them, undoes Gandhi's manacles. The civil servant, showing aloof distaste, walks ahead of Gandhi, who is followed by a prison guard, toward a grand staircase facing the front of the building. People in offices pause to stare at Gandhi, who moves along uncomfortably aware of his prison garb. The tall white doors open, and the civil servant indicates that Gandhi enter, passing two male secretaries. The civil servant scoots around Gandhi to knock on the inner doors, then pushes them open and gestures Gandhi in. Smuts stands behind a grand desk, nods to the civil servant who bows and closes the door, then crosses the room toward a small cabinet. Smuts looks at Gandhi, slightly surprised at Gandhi's frigid refusal tone, then smiles a wry smile and sits on the edge of the chair directed to Gandhi. Smuts measures Gandhi, unsure of how to deal with him, then affects to take Gandhi's irony at face value after a pause. Smuts stares at Gandhi challenging, expecting some contest, and Gandhi mulls it then stands, uncertain about the sudden change in his status. Smuts signs the last document, sees Gandhi's doubt and misreads it, then the tall civil servant enters and stares. Still confused, the civil servant reaches into his pocket, produces a shilling, and hands it to Gandhi, with his own steel showing in an oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in. The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking confused at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance. A British general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his ADC.",
    "1321": "Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light. Headlights appear on the highway. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face, then pulls out his silver 45. The headlights become a family minivan careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well-dressed man in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car, looking around nervously, scared. Seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously for him inside the car. He races around to the gas pump. Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner. An army of dark shapes are swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family. The father lifts the pump. Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. Kyle fires his gun in the air. Blam! Blam! Blam! At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof. His family heard it too and they start to scream to him. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner. The father dashes to the driver's side. He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a blur of movement rushing at him. His blood paints the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them. He finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms. Kyle moves on to the mother. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him. Kyle freezes. He senses something terribly wrong. Audrey raises the 45 and click. She keeps pulling the trigger. The boy's tears stop instantly. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner, blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere. She's trapped. She notices the open door to the minivan. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. Clunk! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life. Charlie rushes to Michael's side, but he's immovable. Charlie cocks the gun, moves toward the door. Charlie looks back at him, defiant.",
    "1322": "Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges past Charlie and out into hell. With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. In the minivan, Audrey screams as the windows begin to crack. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas explodes into a spray of fire! The minivan is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows explode, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire-rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face. Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the knife is driven down. CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife clatters to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. Charlie shakes her head no. Jeep's light catches something on the ground. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. Michael lowers his flashlight. A flickering light emanates from within the diner. Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Bob and Jeep keep watch. The spectral lights in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder.",
    "1326": "Next to a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE, a man deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine-stained fingers of his right hand. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity. A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE, SANDRA and HOWARD ANDERSON. The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard with a caustic smile. And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Howard turns back to his wife, rigid smile. The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path, HEAVY BEATS thundering from within. KYLE WILLIAMS (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style, passes a weathered road sign. Kyle's expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat. He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead. The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. She lets out a long slow exhale. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette, lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Bob steps off the chair, turns to Kyle. Bob is about to respond when Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's interrupting. Bob's expression darkens at this news. Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right alongside him, not giving up. Jeep stiffens, turns to his father. Bob gives Jeep a hard stare. Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall.",
    "1327": "Bob looks up the highway to the north where dark clouds push over the distant mountains, signaling an approaching storm. He reenters the diner, finding Kyle at the counter eating banana pancakes. Before Kyle can speak, Bob's attention is drawn elsewhere. The TV image flickers, and Bob hits the TV, bringing the picture into focus just as the Emergency Broadcasting System alert appears and its tone fills the diner. Everyone stops and looks at the TV. Bob changes the channels, finding them all the same, then steps back from the TV and bumps into Kyle. Kyle rushes past Percy while Charlie clears dishes from the Anderson's table; everyone's eyes are on the TV. Kyle pauses, then redials the phone. Everyone looks at Howard. Kyle reappears in the diner where Jeep is working under the Uhaul's hood with a socket wrench. The old lady turns to the Andersons as a fly buzzes around Gladys's head; she smiles strangely but doesn't react as it crawls across her cheek. Sandra nods at the old woman, uncertain. Howard and Sandra exchange looks as the door jingles and Jeep enters, heading straight to talk to Bob while keeping an eye on the old lady near the Andersons. Charlie places a steak in front of Gladys and rests a hand on her belly. A fly lands on the steak, and Charlie tries to wave it away, but another fly lands. Charlie freezes, glancing at Kyle at the counter. She shakes her head at Gladys, drops the check on the table, and walks past Jeep and Bob. Gladys laughs as she eats, flies swarming around her. Sandra and Howard are shocked; Sandra covers her mouth. Everyone focuses on Gladys. Howard stands up, then collapses to the floor, causing everyone to panic. Gladys stands abruptly, knocking over her table, blood covering her face and chest. Percy quickly grabs a frying pan and hits Gladys, knocking her head sideways.",
    "133": "Gandhi is staring at the street. From his point of view, there is a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari. Another hollow-faced child leans against her. A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn. A woman in a sumptuous silk sari is trying to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate -- silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa. A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman (Mrs. Nehru) stands next to her distinguished husband (Motilal Nehru). She nods lightly toward Nehru. Nehru is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, ascetic looking, but dressed impeccably (Jinnah), the other with a haunting face -- beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical (Prakash -- whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination). Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash. Prakash grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi. Gandhi nods. He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa. Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others. Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes. Behind him we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society. As Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru and Prakash watch him clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes. Gokhale is pleased, Gandhi amused. Another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly. It is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does. He still hasn't smiled, but Gandhi and Charlie have. This is private -- beautiful and still. Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale. He grins self-deprecatingly but Gokhale persists. He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he smiles. When he speaks his voice is thick with feeling. His eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly. Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach. Gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches. A broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun.",
    "1337": "Javert is puzzled. Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover a heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent. The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is too soft. Valjean, Javert, and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud. He throws himself under the cart at the higher end and braces himself to lift it from beneath. At one end, the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking—the ground is harder here. Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent. Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue. Fantine presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors. They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways. The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus. A man selling dentures stands by his cart, and we hear fragments of his sales pitch. Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the voices of the whores on either side. Fantine heads to the tooth man. A pimp and the head whore watch her progress as the organ grinder grinds out the music. Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore. The pimp pushes her down. She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth. She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed. The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're all fit for business. He moves in on Fantine. Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to draw her into their world. On the rotting warship, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus. Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge Fantine's cheeks. The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the hulk. Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the rotting ship. The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress.",
    "1338": "The pimp joins the captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates like a twisted wedding ceremony. Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel. Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. A rotting straw mattress is seen within as they enter, then Fantine lays down. A man's hand leaving money is seen. Fantine lies alone on the mattress, then pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district, talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. Fantine moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. She is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet. Javert is quietly coldly furious. He shows the blood. Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Valjean steps out of the shadows. Javert turns to Fantine. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream. Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face. Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms. As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them. As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his assistant stops him with an urgent letter. Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake. Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and stands before him. Valjean conceals his shock. He looks up. Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks. Valjean is furiously packing stuff up. The driver is Valjean, hesitating. Close on two horses panting. Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the courtroom. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the doors open and Valjean bursts in. The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-out, stands before the JUDGE. He looks uncannily like the real Valjean. Sensation in the court.",
    "1344": "At a buffet, Charles, large and wearing an ill-fitting black suit, stands with Martin, who is handsome and dressed in a shirt and tie. The setting is a modest Ohio house in 1979, with around forty darkly dressed friends and neighbors gathered. Quiet discussions are taking place, and some people are crying. It is a grey, snow-covered day in early February in Lillian, Ohio. Outside the house, many cars are parked, notably a sheriff's department squad car in the driveway. Joe, wearing a too-big black suit, sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years, solemnly looking down at a locket he holds. A sound makes him look up as a car arrives—a distinct 1968 Buick GSX, a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe down its center. Joe watches as a man in his early 40s, dressed in jeans and a work shirt, gets out and moves to the house, entering through the porch. Joe's eyes remain glued to the house for a while before he looks back at the locket. As he stares, tears come to his eyes. The moment is broken by the sound of raised voices, followed by the sound of something glass breaking. The house back door bursts open, and Joe sees his father, Jack, leading a handcuffed and in-pain Louis Dainard from the house into the rear of the squad car. Jack slams the back door and sees Joe, freezing as their eyes lock. Jack is more uncomfortable and gets into the car, driving away. Joe watches them drive off and, after a beat, looks down at the locket again. Finally, he closes it. Hundreds of kids eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, with girls emphatically embracing goodbye and boys running off, happy to be out. Suddenly, Charles is there, red-faced, handing Joe pages. They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly, Cary is there, with a burn wrap on his right arm now. Joe stops, but his friends don't. Joe, Charles, and Cary scan the candy aisle, and Joe just nods and looks at a magazine. At Charles's house, his mother cooks while his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, Jen, angrily sets the table where his father pays bills. His pale 15-year-old sister, Peg, does a puzzle, and twin 9-year-old boys bicker over an action figure. The TV in the living room plays a Match Game.",
    "1347": "Jack, in an Air Force uniform, runs through a dark building and stops with his back against the wall. He is scared but armed with a rifle. He peeks around a corner and sees guards and vehicles through a window. Spotting an aircraft fuel tank, he unsafeties his rifle with a metallic click. A soldier near a vehicle is on his radio when the fuel tank explodes in a massive blast. The airmen take cover and move nearby vehicles in the resulting mayhem. Jack, behind the wheel of a military jeep, drives through the exit and back to town. He stops in shock as he sees a mass of vehicles driving from the town. Donny drives with Joe in the passenger seat and Charles, Cary, and Martin in the back. Donny turns onto a dirt road and pulls up, turning off the lights. The kids pile out and climb a fence, moving quickly to a trailer locked with a padlock—the Dungeon. Joe tries prying the locks off with a tire iron but fails. Charles also tries unsuccessfully. Martin grabs the tire iron and breaks off the latch. Inside the Dungeon, the boys look directly ahead, their faces showing they've found the mother lode. With flashlights, they hurry down the hall and break a classroom door window to enter. Surrounded by documents, boxes, photographs, 16mm film canisters, and cassette tapes, Charles threads the film. Joe holds up a 20-year-old photo of men in a lab, including a 50-year-old Woodward. Cary plays a cassette revealing a hangar where scientists examine large pieces of unearthly material. A scientist explains something to senior officers, including a 32-year-old Nelec. The film jump cuts to a reinforced lab cage containing a massive creature. Another jump cut shows a soldier, Woodward, offering a bucket of food to the alien.",
    "135": "He is chairing the Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight. At last, he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. And fleetingly, just at the edge of the picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands. And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands, stilling them again. Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it. Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause. Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility. Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve. This is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention. On the platform, the whispered politics go on. On the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things. Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark. And now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too. Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly. He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform. A cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly. On the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily. We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways. Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel. An open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail. Nehru drives, four friends as young as he with him, all dressed in the same expensive, British manner. Nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride. The ashram is only half-finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost. They are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path.",
    "1350": "A soldier hurries off. Joe leads the group as they turn and look back at a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire, houses getting blown to shit in collateral damage. An explosion hits too close, the boys scream as they run between houses. We track with them, four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege, power goes out, and some explosions are much closer than others. Another big hit and they go to a back door of a house and go inside. They run in for cover, silhouetted in this dark space by the explosion light emanating from the windows. They're all out of breath in a strange kitchen. Another crazy loud and bright explosion, the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter. Another loud blast, sound of glass breaking, and the creature roaring. And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window. Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts. Joe runs, the others follow. But as they get to the living room a huge explosion blows out a wall. They all go down, but Martin is in agony all of a sudden, his leg ripped by concrete. There's blood and Martin is in real pain. Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a hole in it; military vehicles can be seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric tie, which Charles fashions into a tourniquet, wraps it around Martin's leg, tight. Charles looks at Martin, can't argue. Charles nods, Joe looks to Cary. Martin screams. Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town. Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves. Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the garages. They're out of breath, they try one garage door, windows caked with dirt. The second door, dirt-caked windows. The third is a barn door, they try it: locked. The two begin kicking the door together, on three, one, two, crash! Again and again, until finally the door kicks open and they almost fall inside. And thank goodness they didn't, because now we're looking straight down from inside the shed, the entire floor of the shed has been dug out, dropping forty feet straight down, dirt piled, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath. Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July sparkler.",
    "1351": "Jack and Louis are in a jeep, Jack driving fast, Louis beside him. It's awkward but not angry, and finally, Louis seems vulnerable, scared, and sad. Jack looks at him, then back to the road, giving a small nod of forgiveness and gratitude. Louis accepts it, wanting to cry but holding back. Meanwhile, Joe begins climbing down a rope into a nearly-dug hole, landing at the bottom where it's dark. Cary follows, climbing down with the barn roof looming above. At the bottom, there are three possible ways to go. Joe thinks about which way to proceed. They start walking into the dirt tunnel, a tall oval shape. From afar, the scene is mostly black with a small speck of sparkly light. They reach an area littered with living room items, looking up to see another hole leading down, dug straight through a house. Continuing, they come to an intersection with a new tunnel branching off. There's dim light ahead where the tunnel bends, and a rumbling mechanical sound grows louder. Joe and Cary move forward, seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them. They cross to the other side where Cary bumps into a hanging Sheriff Pruitt. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away. Makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light, revealing other tunnels. Joe sees something that makes him grab Cary's shirt—a human leg amidst metal and machinery. They would scream if they didn't need to stay quiet. In a panicked whisper, Joe moves to see the other side of the machinery and finds, in an inset section of the rock-wall, three human bodies hanging. Among them is Alice. Joe's heart pounds, his resolve strengthens. Cary sees her too and opens his backpack, pulling out explosives, glancing up to stay out of the creature's view. Joe races with a lit sparkler for light, the mechanical rumbling almost gone. He looks for another way into the creature's space, finds another intersection, turns into it, and disappears down the tunnel.",
    "1352": "Cary creates a long, insane pile of firecrackers and lays a squiggly, long line of gunpowder back, away from the firecrackers and the entrance to the creature's contraption space. The sparkler dies as light begins to reveal Joe, who slows and peers around the dirt tunnel bend, now on the other side of the space. He sees the creature, then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. Cary finishes laying out the charges and pulls out his lighter, but it won't light. Joe watches as the creature finishes with its meal and heads away. Cary frantically tries the lighter. Tina, a 24-year-old, disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. Joe and Alice have helped down one familiar face: Sheriff Pruitt. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in. Joe and Alice follow and run into a tunnel. Sparkler lighting the way, Joe and Alice lead, with Pruitt and Tina behind them. They sprint in the opposite direction, running hard, but after a long moment, Tina is grabbed away into the darkness, her screams continuing behind them. They run and run, but then hit a dead end, a dirt wall. Out of breath, they turn but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness. The only sound is the sparkler and their erratic breathing. The creature looks at Joe, really looks at him, and after a long, scary beat, sets him down. Joe backs up as the creature turns fast and speeds away. Joe is being hugged by his father, and something in his pocket is moving. He reaches in and pulls out his mother's necklace, holding the chain, but the locket pulls toward the water tower. Joe knows what this means. After a long beat, Joe holds the necklace up, toward the tower, the thing pulling. Tears are in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it, not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.",
    "1353": "Joe and Charles enter, and Charles grabs a roll. Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door. Joe is stunned and heartsick. Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack pulls out a pamphlet and places it on the table. Joe looks at the pamphlet for Hewitt Sports Camp, seeing images of happy, smiling, healthy athletic kids. Joe looks back at the pamphlet, his other hand coming up from under the table, and Jack sees that Joe is holding his mother's locket. Jack wants to cry again and wants to throw that locket away, out of sight, but he just turns away. Joe stares at the pamphlet. There is a focus on Quasimodo, a plastic, painted Aurora model. A paintbrush comes into frame, following it to Joe, holding the brush at his desk, making a model. A boy's room is recently devoid of a mother's oversight and is a mess, with comic books and other plastic models, cars, creatures, and a train, all built and painted by Joe. All the boys look, and their faces brighten. Headlights appear, and the boys stand as the car stops beside them. It’s the yellow Buick, now with 14-year-old Alice Dainard in the driver's seat. She sees Joe and looks away, pissed. All the boys are in silent wait. She considers, annoyed, shakes her head, and the boys excitedly scramble into the car. The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape. Cary messes with the radio, and Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat, and she takes the Twizzler he offers, looking back to the road. Joe walks past Alice, who watches him. Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines, and she looks at him, almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling, the tension almost too much for him to bear. He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does, and Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera. Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat. POP! Everyone jumps—Charles turns—Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker. Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, Detective John Hathaway and Mrs. Rebecca Hathaway. Preston walks past them, acting in the background. Joe is now watching Alice.",
    "1354": "Charles is amazed at the depth and truth Alice brings to her role, and she even starts to cry while performing. He watches in awe, as does Joe, who becomes galvanized, his vague interest in Alice now solidified. Martin is thrown by Alice's passionate performance, and mid-scene she looks at Charles, unsure. Charles runs to her, taking her script pages. They prep to film toward Alice with a train approaching in the background; Charles puts on headphones, and filming begins. Joe notices something odd: a distant vehicle turns onto the tracks. Unsettled, Joe looks back at Alice, then toward the train, hearing a blast of air. Alice and Martin continue their lines, Charles pleased with the scene, but Joe desperately watches the train. He swings the microphone down and yells, then they all run off. The train derails, screeching and hissing, steel bending unnaturally. Joe lies on the ground, frightened, then stands to face a mountain of twisted steel and upside-down train cars. He hears loud metal bangs and screeches, gripping his necklace locket. A train door stabs the ground nearby. Joe turns to it, stunned, then looks back but the noise is gone. Focus shifts to Charles' camera on its side. Joe moves forward, and Cary appears behind him, smiling. Joe turns to see Alice, shaken but alive, and he smiles. Suddenly, Joe knows something and moves to a bloody spot, reaching below the train wheels as others watch. He pulls out his crushed make-up kit and brightens. They all move to Preston (except Cary), seeing crates spilled from a train car, revealing thousands of small white-metal cubes littering the ground.",
    "1355": "Joe kneels and picks something up. Behind them, having walked up the angled sides of overturned train cars, Cary calls out. They move up the mass of metal, revealing a vast view of the wreck. It seems to stretch on forever. He points. Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is the pick-up truck, sheared in half upon impact and lying in the overgrown grass. A boom sounds from behind the shattered pick-up as the kids approach from the wreckage. The camera pushes in on them as they arrive at the truck and stop; what they see makes Joe's heart pound—they're stunned—all of them. They just stop. We see now: it's Dr. Woodward—75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves closer, scared and sad for him. But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he leans, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was holding a paper, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it up. Unfolds it: it's an old map—thin, off-white paper. They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward. We see marker writing on it—a black line, from Nevada to Dayton—and numbers written along the way. But a shadow has appeared: a trembling hand—before they can react, it rips the map away—they all scream as old Dr. Woodward is revealed, bloody eyes open, in a daze. They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly. We're on Joe's stunned face—but distant voices make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck. The rest turn to look—their minds are racing, all of them. The kids start moving away. Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera. Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse—she eyes the flashlight men getting closer. Joe grabs his make-up kit—another duffel—runs for the car, past a whining Charles. As the flashlight men approach, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back—Alice slams the car into reverse, screech-backs up, narrowly avoids debris, then rides off—the flashlight men arrive—soldiers—their adrenaline pumping. One man who walks up to the camera, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: Colonel Nelec. He then looks to the ground in front of him. Close on a fresh, empty yellow Super 8 film box. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We push in on his burning eyes and. RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past. Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera.",
    "1357": "Military trucks, tents, and soldiers are present, with helicopters buzzing in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash. He arrives beside her, looking at the train, haunted. Joe stops reloading his gun, looks out, and gets lost as well. Martin has arrived there too, followed by Preston. Joe moves the camera back to Alice, looking through the lens, using the zoom to see the crash up close, panning from one car to another. Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat before standing up and looking out at the crash. The kids sit at a table by the window, the car lot across the street, talking excitedly but quietly. A waitress is there, delivering more food. Cary smiles at Alice. This moment lands for Joe and all of them. The scene cuts to the massive train wreck that goes on for a mile, with hundreds of military personnel working to clean up fast. A truck drives past the camera, taking us to Jack and Nelec, who walk together amid the debris. Jack looks at Nelec, not quite believing him. Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking up reports from his desk, on his way out. Pruitt walks off, and Jack, unsettled, watches him go. Fingers are tapping on a counter, beside a Walkman. The camera booms up to 23-year-old Breen, who is enjoying the Blondie music he's listening to. He is alone in the station store. Behind him, 60-year-old Sheriff Pruitt enters and throws a candy bar at him. Breen pulls off the headphones and exits the store. Charles suddenly appears with Cary. They head off, planning the explosions. Alice looks at him knowingly, considers this, and then starts doing her best zombie impression. Joe smiles, and Alice slowly leans in toward him, putting her mouth on his neck in a fake bite, making Joe go still. When she pulls back, her performance over, she's smiling. Near the gas pumps, low to the ground, Jack, Edie, and Mr. Blakely come out here. They pass small shattered pieces of red and blue plastic and stop at the gun Sheriff Pruitt dropped. Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19, checking out the broken blue and red plastic as he makes a walkie call. Angry Izzy, 65, opens a new car hood, pieces of the engine ripped away, messy. The camera dollies with him, and Jack follows.",
    "1360": "Nelec moves to the door, remaining facing the camera, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the bed. There is a push in on Nelec's face, understanding his true nature. Joe sleeps, the power still out. Then, a knock. He wakes up. Another knock. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly, Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too. It's odd and silent for a moment. Joe stares, amazed at her. And the power returns -- Joe's clock light goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the projector comes back on; the silent home movie of his mother plays. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away. A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that. Finally, quietly, watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Just then, the Super 8 movie ends: the film flipflipflips. Joe turns off the projector -- but a sound remains. A sort of shudder-hum. Then they look: the shuddering is coming from the cube he took from the crash site, sitting on his desk. Joe and Alice move to it. The cube vibrates, almost imperceptibly. Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing shudders on its own. They are amazed. They get low -- eyes at desk level -- the shuddering increases in pitch and volume -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube bullets away -- five-inch hole in the wall! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, stunned -- push in on Joe, his heart pounding. He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the town water tower. Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully toward her room, when a tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe. This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house. Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a distant fiery glow past the factory and over the hills. The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable. But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his Buick -- starts it up -- pulls out fast and goes after her. Alice pedals hard, she wants to escape everywhere. A block behind her, screech: a car turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn. We're with Louis as he drives -- clearly drunk. Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating.",

She tries to deep throat it. Pete loves it. Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other. They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. Sadie walks outside. Jodi follows her. Charlotte is crying really hard. Charlotte sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to DR. SEDUKU, a foreign doctor. Dr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp. Pete cycles with the crew. Debbie looks around the house for Pete. Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air.

    "137": "The movie begins with the darkness of the ill-lit station and the angle of the camera limiting our vision. The sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station. The captain turns briskly to two of his detail. He turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at his point of view. The whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered thick with waiting crowds. They engulf the station house, back and front, and on the other side of the train more people are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the narrow street that stretches through the little collection of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered—men, women with babes in arms, children. He has stepped down from the train. Shukla guides him, Ba and Charlie a step or two behind. Gandhi moves through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a little to either side. As he advances, the crowd parts—it is almost eerily silent. As their clothes indicate, the area is Muslim, so some salaam and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi as he moves through them. Most of the faces are gaunt and lean. And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him. The sergeant and part of the detail are behind the captain. The captain stares. Then he looks around at the crowd, suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi. There is a flicker of recognition, but uncertain. Another glance at the crowd, this time with an air of outraged authority. It has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the captain is a little shaken by it. He glances at Charlie who stands behind Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain. He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown. It is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the captain doesn't like, but Gandhi's unrelenting stare unnerves him. He glances at Charlie again. Again, the empty severity of weakness. He looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd. Where all was silence before there is now the hum of excitement. Already he has scored a victory—and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings. The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling. We feature a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha). He lies on a straw mat.",

The party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are trying to help keep the conversation going. Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is holding two of them, while Larry carries one. Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator.

    "1373": "Harry, Ron, and Hermione are seated on a train when a lady appears at their door. Ron realizes he doesn't have enough money as Cho Chang walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho look at each other and smile, and Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head. Four flying horses pulling a carriage land at Hogwarts, and a large ship emerges from under the water and approaches. The crowds cheer as a man runs up the aisle, limping comically, whispers something to Dumbledore, and leaves. A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle, release butterflies, bow, and everyone applauds. A series of older boys walk up the aisle with bo staffs, twirl them, stab them into the ground with a spark effect, and breathe fire. They embrace as the man seated next to Hagrid yelps because Hagrid has stabbed a fork into his hand. A strange man stands in the doorway, casts magic upwards, seals the roof, and peace is restored. This character enters the room, begins walking, sees Harry through his mechanical eye, limps, and breathes heavily. The crowd is unsettled, people are booing as Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame. A suspicious character enters the room where the goblet is still burning, closes the door, and writes his name on the board. Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger, pops open a jar with a spider in it, and uses his wand to send it around the class. The class is unsettled, Draco laughs, and Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face. Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling as Neville Longbottom stands. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals, then stops. Neville is disturbed as Mad-Eye picks up the spider which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head, and he casts a spell and the spider disintegrates. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window as Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder. Neville nods. Older students are placing their names into the flame and others are applauding, Cedric is one of them. The twins come up cheering, jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names in the flame, do a high-five, but the flame fires up and they're flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have full heads of grey hair and beards. Suddenly they are fired on as Arthur and others approach.",

Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the surface with both Ron and the girl. He's attacked and gets held down, he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface. Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd is. Fleur kisses Harry on the face, then Hermione kisses Harry on the head. Cedric and his friends cheer. As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering him. Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry. Mad-Eye approaches them. Barty walks away from him. Harry holds his head in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless. Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters. Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips at his hand. The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks. Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence. Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor. Igor protests loudly. Barty hits the gavel repeatedly. Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic, he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar. Guards seize Barty junior. Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic out from his head. The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves. Severus closes the door in Harry's face. The champions emerge. The crowd cheer on hearing his name. The Bulgarian crowd goes nuts. The cannon goes off. Mr. Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan out to see the maze is many stories tall. Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being swallowed into the undergrowth. He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry runs.",
    "1379": "The tent blooms softly with light, briefly illuminating a bedside photograph of James & Lily Potter, then goes dark. The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a toilet flushes. Instantly, the shadow stiffens, the blankets dim, and the tent flattens. Just as the bedroom door opens, revealing Uncle Vernon. He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then withdraws. The tent rises. As the blankets blaze, we cut inside, find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks. A blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of Number Four. The light in the hallway snaps on, Harry's tent droops once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. Slowly, he closes the door. Uncle Vernon eyes the parchment in Harry's hand suspiciously. Just then Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his ankle. As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy. Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry. Pop! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand explodes. Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise. Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- Zing! -- a button on her dress sails into the air. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole body billows. And she begins to inflate like a monstrous balloon. To his horror Uncle Vernon himself begins to rise. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And watches Aunt Marge float away. Harry crashes inside, takes his trunk, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard and removes his wand from its hiding place. Turning, he grabs the photograph of his parents. Boom! Boom! Boom! Harry tows the trunk down the stairs, finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty. As Harry storms out with his trunk, we dolly to the street with him. High in the sky, a plump dot rises. Harry walks and walks and walks, then stops. Glances about. An empty playground. Swings creaking gently on rusted chains. A tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Harry, still as a statue. In the trees above, leaves tremble. Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.",
    "138": "Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening in a way that opens the heart. Behind him, a mass of villagers sits stoically outside the dwelling, waiting while their case is heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze, his despair keeps cracking through. Near to breakdown, he gestures around the empty house. He cannot go on. Meha nods. Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, where almost nothing remains. Two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the other older, and a girl, sixteen are seen. And finally, Meha's wife sits near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty. Gandhi nods. The words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes. He glances at Meha's wife. Water comes to her eyes, and she lowers her head. Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps her to her, and the woman breaks, and sobs and sobs. Gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant, his mind locked in sober reflection. Shukla shares the howdah with him but does not dare break Gandhi's black mood. It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but Ba. A ball is hit. The camera pulls back to reveal a lush, verdant pitch, white-garbed players, English, a few ladies dressed in First World War fashion watching under parasols near the clubhouse and in the shade of trees with a few officers and civil servants, while Indian servants discreetly serve cool drinks. The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then. The wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again, he has looked up. A car is pulling hurriedly in near the clubhouse, an officer in it, and people are streaming toward it. A major is standing on the back seat. An Indian corporal drives. The captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, his determination. He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time. He is wearing only a white loincloth, the shawl over his shoulders and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of his life. Charlie studies him a moment, and being Charlie, he understands. He grins, and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi. And Gandhi laughs. And again Gandhi laughs. Charlie turns to the guard. The police guard hesitates, and then unlocks the cell. Charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space between them.",
    "1381": "As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the bell continues to chime—DING! DING!—and the time reversal ends, leaving the room empty except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion. Hermione ignores his unspoken question, eyes the clock on the wall, then grabs Harry's arm and slams through the door. They come to a mad, huffing halt. She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry follows her gaze and blinks in disbelief as he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths. Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the hourglass. A soft smack is heard. They turn, see Malfoy land on the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his kisser. Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later, footsteps clamor over their heads. Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin patch. Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is handing Scabbers to Ron. As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks fiercely. Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing closer. She frowns, glances into the hut. Just then on the ground beside her Hermione notices a jagged star-shaped stone. Instantly, she grabs it, rises, and hurls it through the open window. Smash! The sound of a glass jar shattering is heard within the hut. Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone through the window and—conk!—off the back of Harry's head. Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party arrives, raps on the door. Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope. The coast clear, they slip out of the trees. As Harry vaults into the patch, the crows stir, cawing at his ankles, pecking at his feet. Buckbeak refuses to move. Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into the forest just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie. Harry and Hermione—their view unobstructed by the low stand of trees this time—watch the Executioner approach the pumpkin patch. Quickly, the confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger. The Executioner lifts his blade and—with a brutal fury—plunges it into the flesh of a pumpkin with a sickening chop. The crows scatter to the skies. Harry and Hermione race through the trees as Buckbeak lopes easily behind. Subjective POV, gliding through a thicket of trees, to the forest's edge, the trees thinning, revealing the Whomping Willow thrashing. Hermione disappears down the hole, then a figure approaches the tree, Lupin.",
    "1384": "Fudge turns and Harry glances warily from the steaming tureen of green to Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut sliver. Fudge smiles nervously. Harry eyes the stack of books, one bound by a rope. Through the window, the rooftops of London are visible. A train passes and the camera pulls back, revealing Harry standing with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks, and studies the growling tome -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then gives the rope a tug. Instantly the book leaps to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers snapping. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins nipping viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a pillow. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry pounces -- flumph! The book roars angrily, muffled beneath the pillow. A young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall. Harry exits his room as the witch knocks on a door. As she opens the door, she's greeted by a thunderous roar and a rush of wind. Something small and fast dashes by Harry's feet. Looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking rat (Scabbers), pursued by a decidedly ugly orange cat (Crookshanks). As Harry moves down the stairs, voices come from below. As Harry reaches the bottom, he finds Ron Weasley protectively cradling Scabbers, while Hermione Granger does her best to restrain a hissing Crookshanks. Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn. In the accompanying photo, the entire Weasley family stands before the Great Pyramids, waving. Smack in the middle is Ron, Scabbers perched on his shoulder. Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles. Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster. Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue, then hesitates yet again. She points. Just then, the compartment rattles. Lanterns flicker. The train lurches, begins to slow. Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the corridor. Harry's POV -- all along the carriage, heads look out curiously. Then -- the train jerks -- the car sways -- and the lamps running along the ceiling flicker and die. A thin wisp of steam escapes Ron's mouth. Ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window. Suddenly the car sways violently. From the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin comes out a shivering light, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert, wary. Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand. Harry's glasses. As he leaves, Harry turns to Ron and Hermione. She shakes her head. Harry looks to the window and we push in on his reflection.",
    "1385": "It becomes a glimmering puddle and omitted. SPLASH! a carriage wheel shatters the glassy surface as we tilt up, catch a procession of horseless carriages, carrying students toward the glimmering castle. Gradually, the sweet sound of a choir rises on the air, a flash of lightning bleaches the night sky and we cut to the Great Hall. The camera glides toward the windows of the Great Hall, toward the candlelit silhouettes glimmering within, passing through the glass. At the High Table, Lupin sits with Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, and Albus Dumbledore. We track along the faces of the choir, singing to the strains of a harpsichord, and land on a quintet of toads (one of which -- Trevor -- belongs to Neville Longbottom, who looks on with pride). As the choir's song concludes, Dumbledore rises, beaming over the sea of black hats. Amid scattered applause, Harry, Ron, Hermione clap. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other -- stunned -- then applaud vigorously. Hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending water goblets weaving. At the Slytherin table, Draco Malfoy, flanked by the ever-present Crabbe and Goyle, catches Harry's eye, feigns a dead faint. Students exit the Great Hall, scale the Marble Staircase. Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive at the seventh floor landing and approach the Fat Lady in the portrait. Ron spins. Frowns at Hermione. Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and grasps. All turn, see Lavender bent over her textbook. Harry peers into his cup. The tea leaves shift. The trio emerge from the bridge and make their way toward Hagrid's hut. Students gather around Hagrid as Harry, Ron, and Hermione arrive. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the Slytherins. There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily. The entire class steps back, leaving Harry in front. Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And bows. Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily. Harry starts to step back, when Buckbeak ducks his beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved. Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class claps. Harry smiles. Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's back, and before Harry's settled, slaps Buckbeak's hindquarters. In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons slash down. Malfoy freezes. Looks down at the blood blossoming on his robes. Shrieks. Instantly, Harry dashes forward. Buckbeak whips around, raises its talons and -- seeing Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Breathes. Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table. They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddled over a copy of The Daily Prophet.",
    "14": "Lester knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now. He kisses her—a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex—then turns to the others and grins. Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face. He crosses off. Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, laughing too loud at their jokes. Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally, Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want? Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This situation is loaded and they both know it. Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a joint. Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large catering boss in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint. He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs. Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester quickly hides the joint behind his back. And she goes back inside. Jane and Angela are watching MTV. Jane switches off the TV. She starts toward the kitchen. Lester enters and opens the refrigerator. He turns and is instantly transfixed by: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. She starts toward him. She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. Extreme close-up on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in slow motion. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything slows down, and all sound fades. Close on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a rose petal from his mouth. Jane glances at Angela, irritated. Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Carolyn enters from the dining room. He can't believe what he's hearing. Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door.",
    "140": "The cheap glasses, the nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting. Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice, thrice. Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls. Amid the screams and sounds of chaos, we dissolve through to soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-step, step of the requiem march. The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege, it reveals more and more. We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally, we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence. Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans. We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway. Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands. And behind them a broad mass of Indians. The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body: the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves, and finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father. The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor. He looks up suddenly, then turns back quickly to his work. Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so. The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in. Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner.",
    "141": "Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive. He picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle. Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk. Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward. Sir George looks at the document on the secretary's desk. The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him. Sir George looks at it like a snake. The secretary picks up a pen and offers it. A second, then Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily. Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet. He turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal. Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality. Again Gandhi grins at the extravagance. A polite little laugh; Jinnah introduces him. Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after that comment. Azad gives a gentle salaam. Gandhi turns. He stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention. All the others have been dressed in European clothes. The handsome Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic -- much like the one that Gandhi once wore. For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile. He looks at Gandhi. Again the temper of it produces a little silence. He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea. Of them all, Nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician and Jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it. His stand has produced a little shock of surprise. Holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile. They all look at him with some surprise. As he speaks, he rises and walks to the servant. They all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them. He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him. As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah. It impresses each one of them. But for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution. Patel is the first to recognize the implications. The idea has caught hold. Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly. His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb. He holds the telegrams forward. He glances at the general. That takes the wind out of all of them. Grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens. A prison door opens. Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room. The door is held open by a prison guard.",
    "142": "Nehru waits for Gandhi. He rises when Gandhi enters. The guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from Nehru. The guard closes the door but remains in the room. Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting. Gandhi, who also looks worn, raises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name. Gandhi sighs, and their faces and minds go to more somber matters. Gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair. The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering. The sound of a car and marching feet. The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees, and then suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. He is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis -- immaculate, precise, awesome. Behind them, a staff car with Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer. It is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding. A large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling wall. A large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park. It is political, but the crowd is mixed. We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old men, little children, women with babes in arms. We close in on the speaker -- a Muslim. He clutches a copy of Gandhi's journal. General Dyer, his armored car, his sepoys, moving toward the gate. Dyer looks ahead calmly. The Gate of the Bagh. A rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall. Nearer, a few vendors, loiterers, and children. At the sound of the armored car and marching feet, a few turn in curiosity. The armored car grinds forward. It won't go through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post. Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away. Dyer jumps down lightly -- a man in splendid condition. He walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back. Looking off at the speaker -- medium shot. Medium close -- the sepoys and Dyer. He issues his commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers. A ripple of panic now, everyone pressing back, but still they cannot credit what they see. Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter. Close shot Dyer, still calm. Flash shot along the line of sepoys; the rifles jerk and bang.",
    "145": "They look at each other with a kind of fear a rampant crowd can excite in those who must hold it. The small train station near the ashram. Kallenbach stands by a new (early 1920s) Ford touring car, watching as a train pulls into the station. As people start to jump off the train he moves forward. Despite the Indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive, patrician lawyer he is under the skin. As he moves through the crowded platform, Kallenbach is smiling too. He reaches for the bags again. In the chaos of the Third Class, we see Maulana Azad coming out of a section of the coach. He is carrying a baby wrapped in rags. The child's mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out. Azad hands the woman the baby and she obviously thanks him. He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera. Resume Patel and Kallenbach. Patel grins. Like most witty men, he loves wit in others. Patel groans. They turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall Indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely English despite the sari. The minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled Kallenbach. The camera is on a row of sandals by the door -- Patel's, Azad's, Desai's, Gandhi's. It pans to the room. Gandhi sitting facing Patel and Azad, Desai in the background, making notes of the discussion. Gandhi is carding fiber to thread as they talk. Mirabehn, seated like the others, is almost in the circle, sitting near Ba, and listening like her. Ba's spinning never stops. Gandhi looks up at Azad, Azad shakes his head solemnly. But he does not go on. It has a terrible sobriety. Azad shakes his head. Gandhi reaches out and touches his hand. He holds Azad's eyes, giving strength. Then he turns to Mirabehn, made more aware of her by Azad's reference. For a moment he looks at her sari. Gandhi smiles approvingly. Then a shadow. Mirabehn beams. Mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at Ba. Ba is spinning. She smiles. Mirabehn looks at her, accepting the warmth behind the teasing. It is the beginning of an enduring friendship. A small town. Featuring the faces of six Indian police constables as a torch light parade passes them. There are enough of them in their group to be watching the marchers with a challenging disdain. The marchers are men in loin-clothes and tunics; they brandish torn and ripped English cloth and shout in unison.",
    "146": "Another angle shows some marchers turning at a shout. Some of the tail-enders watch, with a few running clear of the police and others being beaten. Two police have a man on the ground, and one policeman looks up. Patel leans on a table, his mood as devastated as Gandhi's, looking at an Indian paper by his hand. It is a New York Times, and a glimpse of a picture shows a severed head lying in smoldering ashes. In the background, Nehru, Azad, Desai, and Jinnah are present. Jinnah is dressed in a finely cut European suit, while the others wear tunics of homespun. They turn to him with a sense of surprise but don't believe he means the statement. Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah. Azad keeps his eyes fixed on Gandhi, sensing and fearing what is going to happen. He looks at Gandhi with mounting annoyance. Gandhi listens but remains withdrawn. Jinnah turns away in anger, and Patel sighs. Nehru feels helpless but continues to try. Gandhi stares into nothing, mulling. Finally, Nehru stares at him, surprised, and ignores the thought, his mind already on the real danger. Gandhi looks up at him with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi's bungalow, carrying a small tray with a pitcher and a glass. A few people work in the background, and a mass of people are camped near the entrance, all waiting. On the steps of Gandhi's bungalow, a doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch, reading. Beside him is a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment. He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and sees Ba sitting by Gandhi's mat bed in the shadows. Gandhi heaves in a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall. When finished, he lies limp in Ba's arms, and she gently lowers him to the mat, stroking his head. Mirabehn stiffens, not yet a devotee and nurse. She removes her sandals, walks across the room, strokes Gandhi's sweating head, touches his shoulder, and gets up. The two women hold each other's gaze, then Ba smiles weakly and leans into Mirabehn's shoulder before straightening and leaving without looking back. Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side.",
    "149": "Walker becomes too entranced by the ceremony and the depth of layered emotions in Gandhi and Ba's voices and eyes to take any notes. Ba and Gandhi, near to meeting now, take the last step to stand face to face. Their eyes hold for a moment, reflecting the many dreams, hopes, pain, and love of many years. Walker watches, his own face taut with emotion. Gandhi slowly lifts his hand. Both Walker and Collins are touched, the overtly cynical American even more than the likeable Englishman. Gandhi turns to them. A tiny, beautiful city rises steeply out of the Arabian Sea with tall, thick-walled buildings, half-fortresses, half-homes, their white walls tinted amber and gold by the early light of the sun. Gandhi sits on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation. He becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and turns to see Walker approaching with a little knapsack over his shoulder. Gandhi smiles, then scowls up in the early light. They both watch the waves beat on the shore a moment, the changing hues of the sunrise on the whites of Porbandar. Walker studies Gandhi as this profound man reaches a profound insight. Gandhi stares out to sea, his mind locked in reflection, then suddenly his head lifts, his eyes become alert, and he stands, his manner suddenly tingling with optimism. Walker stares at him, then at the waves lapping the shore below them. He turns back to Gandhi, puzzled, but there is no mistaking the sudden glow in Gandhi's face. Gandhi looks at him with a teasing smile, then briskly starts down the promontory. Walker scrambles up after him as gulls fly over them, squawking in the growing light. Gandhi turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident and elated, then continues down the promontory. Still baffled, Walker glances at the sea, at him, then hurries after. The waves run against the shore. Irwin looks in astonishment at his principal secretary, his ADC, a general, a brigadier, and a senior police officer who are with him. Like him, they hold the same offices but are a new team. Irwin looks at him, still trying to penetrate the significance of the act. The senior police officer helps.",
    "151": "He's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European. He gestures to the back of the train. Gandhi is nonplussed and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself. The porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's suitcases. He reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card which he presents to the conductor. Gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence, but is beginning to react to it, this time with a touch of irony. The Porter stares -- amazed. He turns and walks out of the compartment. We are in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home. Facing Gandhi are Khan, a tall, impressive Indian, Singh, slighter and older than Khan, but wiry and looking capable of physical as well as intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed. It is said with a dignity and strength that makes the statement all the more bewildering. Gandhi looks around helplessly. We see Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's naiveté. Gandhi is holding a British legal document; he lifts it pointedly. Gandhi looks at Mr. Baker almost in disbelief. Mr. Baker smothers a smile. Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously. He smiles, but his eyes show that it is no joke. Gandhi glances from one to the other them -- absorbing the inconceivable. And then almost before our eyes his innocence of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of it all. Its tone is chilling, and Gandhi's firmness is shaken a little. The sturdy Khan is studying him with a look of wry interest. Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly determined to take it. A wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire. Before them, a small crowd, mostly Indian (Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims), but with a few Whites drawn by curiosity. Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd. We see the English reporter waiting skeptically. Near him, trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables). A horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them. We see five or six women in saris standing together. We feature Gandhi's wife, Ba, standing at the front of the women. She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not. Gandhi wets his lips nervously. He glances with a little apprehension at the police, then takes his notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire.",
    "152": "A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play. The crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them. A newsreel truck and crew ride along about two-thirds of the way back, while a car of cameramen and reporters tails at the end. Gandhi looks at Walker, walking along a few paces behind him, at the side of the procession. Walker is wiping sweat from his face. Gandhi smiles and turns back, shaking his head. Grinning, he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd. As the procession trails into the village, several villagers with knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders run around the police and join the end of the procession. Gandhi is in the center of the wildly cheering crowd, the camera pulling back and back, the shot becoming black and white, and the music of Movietone News is heard. The Movietone Music tag plays as the film fades and the lights go up on a couple of civil servants moving about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office. The general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's ADC, and the principal secretary are all present. The two men who ran the projector are quietly dismantling it. Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets but answers the implied questions. Irwin sighs, nods, and for the first time, he is truly angry. His face falls. Men, women, and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables. A group of policemen barge into the room, knocking tables and salt and paper in every direction with their lathis, seizing some of the volunteers for arrest. In the chaos, an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street. The truck is loaded with boxes that contain salt packets, and Nehru and eight or nine others are selling them to people who flock about the truck. The sound of horses is heard. Nehru lifts his head. Mounted Indian police are coming down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center. Some of the people run, others deliberately stand fast. The mounted police converge on the truck. Nehru is grabbed and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street. One of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman.",
    "155": "Bourke-White, who has been moving and crouching to shoot Gandhi and the light, sags back against the wall, relaxing at last. She has a smile as penetrating and warming as his. Gandhi grins and glances toward his dhoti, meaning he doesn't wear many clothes. Bourke-White bursts into an appreciative radiance—already she has assessed him and been won. Gandhi walks along, Bourke-White loping along beside him, a little distance away, listening, but searching too for an angle, a moment that is right. She has Gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him. Gandhi shrugs but suffers it. We feature him, low, from her point of view, as he walks on, the soldier pacing on the wall in the background. She clicks. A spinning wheel works rapidly. Gandhi is at the wheel and he is smiling off at Bourke-White, who is trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning wheel. The garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful. She's grinning at her own frustration and she keeps trying, but there's no doubt she means it. Gandhi's smile broadens. And they both laugh. A guard on the wall distantly looks at them wonderingly. He pivots around, moving beside her, and slowly demonstrates the process, taking her hands, guiding her. Bourke-White watches him as much as the wheel. And he smiles a little wisely at her. His tone is not altogether patient. She looks at him in surprise and he sighs tolerantly. Bourke-White accepts it at face value. She opens another line of inquiry. Ba pauses. Again Ba smiles. She shrugs. The implication is it was a long time ago. She looks at them soberly and then they all burst into laughter like girls. Military move quietly but urgently in and out around the main entrance. Two military ambulances are drawn up nearby. A British major comes down the steps quickly. He is almost at the bottom when a British army doctor starts to go up them. The major signals him to one side. They talk quietly and confidentially. The major looks defeated and depressed by the news. Ba lies on a mat, a pillow beneath her head, her eyes closed, her breathing short. Mirabehn sits next to her, rubbing a hand up and down her arm. Gandhi sits a little distance away, staring at the floor and into nothingness. Pyarelal sits inconspicuously behind him. Azad and Patel come to the doorway, Patel makes the pranam toward Ba and holds it as he obviously prays. Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.",
    "157": "An Indian regimental band begins playing martial music as a detachment of Indian Royal Air Force members comes to attention following their NCO's shouted command. An elaborately dressed military aide opens the door for Lord Louis Mountbatten, who steps out onto the platform in naval uniform. He pauses and salutes. Nehru, Lady Mountbatten, and other dignitaries are present. English and Indians watch as Mountbatten approaches microphones labeled NBC, CBS, BBC, and others. He grins and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd, which is interrupted by the sound of a door opening. Jinnah stands by a pillar of the immense portico during a break in their Independence Conference. As he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with Azad. Jinnah's anger is evident, and he addresses Gandhi in hushed but fierce words. Nehru and Patel approach from the conference room, both looking worn and angry. Jinnah raises his voice deliberately so Nehru will hear. He sneers at an idea but cools slightly. Gandhi stares at Jinnah, trying to understand his anger and fear. He turns to see Mountbatten standing in the doorway, feeling the conflict is best handled in formal discussion. Gandhi nods, and reluctantly, the adversaries move back to the conference room, with Gandhi being the last to enter. Elsewhere, Godse waves a black flag and shouts, revealing a gathering of Hindu youths near the ashram entrance. The youths and Kallenbach look back toward the ashram. Nehru steps out onto the porch, his presence silencing the youths. Gandhi rises from the floor, pausing halfway to listen, then sighs wearily. Mirabehn spins across the room, signaling someone out of sight. Gandhi's grandnieces, Manu and Abha, rise quickly at Mirabehn's signal; Manu helps with his shawl, Abha holds his sandals. Gandhi looks worried. Mirabehn smiles, and Gandhi taps Abha on the head sharply, then gently. Abha nods obediently, smiling faintly. Gandhi looks almost saddened by her youthful beauty before going out.",
    "159": "Patel reacts with surprise and apprehension. Patel and Azad are present along with Pyarelal, and now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan is with them for the first time among Gandhi's intimate group. It is an empty and despairing echo of Gandhi's words. He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly. It has almost stopped him. He is moving toward the door. It stops them all. Gandhi turns, looks at him bleakly. There are fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, of looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles and occasional sirens. The camera zooms in on a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets. Outside one of the houses is a car, an army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers and a group of people. It seems a little island of calm in a sea of wild chaos. On the roof of the house, a figure moves into the light. He peers down at the dark, rioting streets. Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose house this is, Mirabehn and Pyarelal are with him along Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A police commissioner moves to Gandhi's side, demanding his attention. A surging gang of youths, many carrying torches, and far outnumbering the little group of police and soldiers, are shouting up at the roof. We see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them. A few hold knives still wet with blood. It is a comment too grave for glibness, and Gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it. He pauses for a moment, staring down at the youth. Nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many. He grips his temples. Nehru thinks on it solemnly, then nods yes. The sounds of rioting and looting on nearby streets, but here a mass of people are gathered. Many youths with black flags. It runs up the side of the building and is lined with waiting people. Azad clears someone aside and ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning. Nehru pauses as he lowers his head. Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot. He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain. A doctor sits near the foot of the cot, Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White. They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting. She knows Gandhi's feeling for him. Bourke-White stares at him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly, almost reflexively, for her camera.",
    "16": "Carolyn switches on the bedside light and sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, likes it, and feels good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers contentedly, smiling. We're flying high above the neighborhood, seeing the two Jims jogging below us. We approach them steadily until we're at street level, following the two Jims. Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison as Lester runs into frame, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches up, then the three men run together in the early morning light. The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the urine sample in front of him. The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when he sees Lester and the Jims jog down the street. Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting. He laughs, extends his hand to the Colonel, and salutes him good-naturedly, grinning. An awkward beat follows. He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. Ricky enters, followed by Lester. He gives the urine specimen to Lester, then locks the door. Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it. Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a drawer. He takes clothing out and piles it on his bed. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a false bottom, revealing rows of marijuana, tightly packed in zip-loc bags. Lester smiles, thinking this kid's cool. Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut roses, passes by the garage window. She stops and sniffs the air, frowning, then peers through the window. Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new weight bench, doing bench presses with shiny new barbells. The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary. Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up. Lester looks up, squinting at the door raising to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a remote at us. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights, and she's gone. Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document. Lester sits across from him, smiling. Brad laughs, then stops, leaning back in his chair, studying Lester. Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years.",
    "165": "He turns and waves to the parlor window. The three boys are there -- all bigger -- and Ba holds a new addition; they all wave. And Gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street. He gestures Charlie on and starts walking. Charlie nods uncertainly. He looks back at the cab in confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace. They have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down. Ahead of them three youths (twenty, twenty-one) in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path. They react to the sight of Gandhi -- fun. Then stride the pavement menacingly. One of them tosses aside his cigarette. Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head. He starts to move forward. Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself. They are getting closer. The youths laughing, whispering. One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard. It lands at Gandhi's feet. He pauses, looking at the youth. He starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly frightened, but. And he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, but. A woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly. It is the first youth's mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably. A snickering response from the other youths -- but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of Colin's mother's attitude. Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth. And he steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly. As they stride on, Charlie glancing back. Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner. A busy street in the center of the town. Gandhi and Charlie come around the corner into it. He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting. And now he turns to Sonja. Sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding. Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly. A strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document. Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts. A cameraman records the moment with a flash photo. General Smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document. The reporter who stands opposite him is Walker, much, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral. Smuts has risen. He knows how to concede with grace. The gaze is firm, strong, cynical. The sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot.",
    "174": "Harry's smile goes away. Chili smiles at her. Hooked. Martin is leaning forward. Martin leans forward. Bo Catlett exchanges a look with the Bear. Then, Bo Catlett signals the waiter. Karen, Martin, and Chili walk out to the driveway. Chili follows Martin over to the minivan, opens the door for him. Bo Catlett and Harry are laughing as Harry, very drunk now, finishes another drink. Harry looks at Bo, can't believe what's happening to his life, thinks a moment, then. Harry shakes his head, looks around the restaurant. Bo and the Bear exchange a look. As Chili and Karen enter the restaurant. Chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing. Keeps his eyes up there as he says. Another glance at the Bear. And they all look. Chili moves to the staircase, now sees the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top. Chili slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until he's looking at the man's bearded face. Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table. Chili unbuttons his coat. Chili gets within three steps of the guy and stops, but doesn't look up, keeps his eyes fixed on the man's gut. Bo walks past Chili, goes down the stairs. Karen watches now as Bo Catlett puts a hand in his coat pocket, steps right up to Chili. Karen looks at him. Even Karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering Harry. Karen and Chili look at each other as Harry finishes his drink. Harry looks at the two of them, differently now. Chili looks at Karen, smiles, shakes his head. Harry looks at him. Harry hangs up at the other end. Bones thinks about it a moment, then tosses the book aside. Phone to his ear, Harry downs another drink, sits up. As Bones bursts out of the john and grabs the phone. This gets Bones' attention. Bones stares at the phone. He sits there a moment, also staring at the phone. Chili stands there while Curtis opens Chili's wallet and looks at the driver's license while Dunbar in the plaid shirt pulls the Lakers T-shirt out of the athletic bag, feels around inside. Chili watches Curtis pick up the note with the Newark flight number and arrival time written on it. Chili glances about, makes sure no one's around, then pulls the key for the 'right' locker out from a crack in the pavement, near the stairwell. Now there's a big guy in a plaid wool shirt next to him, the same guy we saw when Bo Catlett was here. And Christ, another guy now, this one down the aisle, talking on his hand radio.",
    "176": "He steps on Harry's neck with his shoe, pinning him to the floor. Harry can't speak; his jaw is broken. He looks sad lying there pinned beneath Ray Bones' shoe, wondering how it all went so wrong. Harry, a crumpled heap, looks up and we see his bloody pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room. Bones pulls a 9mm from his coat pocket and aims it down at Harry's face. Bones aims the gun at him. Ray Bones looks over as Ronnie Wingate strolls into the office. Harry actually looks glad to see him. Ronnie opens his jacket so that Ray Bones can see the .357 Ronnie's got tucked into his belt. Bones looks at the gun, looks up at Ronnie standing there, hands on his hips, holding his jacket open. Bones raises his own gun. Harry looks pleadingly at Ray Bones. Harry rolls over on to his side. Beer in hand, Chili sits in a chaise longue by the pool. Karen watches him a moment from the doorway. He looks over. She comes over, sits down. Chili looks at Karen a moment. Feeling him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset, and tries to change the subject. He looks at her, puts his drink down. And he leans over and kisses her. Karen and Chili lie in bed together. She looks at him. She leans over and kisses him. Chili and Karen both jerk upright. As Doris leads Karen and Chili towards the triage area. Karen and Chili exchange a look as they follow her into. Doris smiles as two UNIFORMED COPS walk past. Where Harry lies in bed in a pain-killer stupor. Both of his eyes are black. His face is swollen and purple. They all look over as a RESIDENT walks over trailed by several. Doris winks at one of the young med students as the resident then turns to her, Karen, Chili. They step back as the Resident pulls the curtain shut, blocking their view of Harry. Standing beside some giant mutant maggot or something. Bo Catlett looks at the Bear, then smiles at Farrah. Bear watches uncomfortably as Farrah sits down with Bo. Bo looks up at the Bear. And he winks at Farrah. Bo Catlett keeps his mouth close to her ear. He opens the door for her. Chili's minivan is parked out front. As the valet drives off with Chili's minivan, a CAB pulls up and Harry - his hands bandaged, his neck in a massive brace - gets out. Harry waves them off points to himself as he mumbles through his wired jaw. He then pushes past them and limps up the steps. All eyes are on Harry as they're led to a table.",
    "180": "Laurie comes back downstairs, takes a key out of her purse, and steps to the window before moving to the front door. She puts the key to the Doyle house in her pocket, locks the Doyle house, and walks away out into the street. The camera moves toward the Wallace house, dark and ominous, as the wind whips Laurie's clothes and hair. She moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind, and sees Bob's car sitting on the street. Laurie picks up her speed, moving up the sidewalk as the house looms closer. The camera moves up to the front of the Wallace house while Laurie walks up to the front porch. She knocks on the door and rings the doorbell, then stands there a moment, listening for any sound of life from inside. Laurie waits, thinks a moment, then looks to the street. She steps off the porch and walks around to the side of the house, with the camera tracking her. Laurie turns and walks through the breezeway between the house and garage around to the back door. She pulls open the door and steps into the house, standing there a moment staring into the blackness. The kitchen is dark, and Laurie searches for the wall light, looking again into the darkness. Hearing a dragging sound from upstairs that stops abruptly, Laurie moves to the head of the staircase and slowly starts up the staircase. As she slowly moves up the stairs, she reaches the top and stops. At the end of the hall is the bedroom door, with the faintest orange glow coming from around its edges. Laurie moves for the door, with the camera tracking her, and the camera slowly tracks through the darkened bedroom of the Wallace house. She reaches the door, and it swings open to reveal a Jack-O-Lantern casting an eerie glow around the room. There is someone lying on the bed, but from this position, Laurie can't see. She moves forward toward the bed and sees Annie lying there, her face chalky white with a huge red gash across her throat. Laurie stares at the bed and then screams at the top of her lungs, jumping back to the door. She sees Bob strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling, dangling in the middle of the room with eyes open and staring. Laurie shrinks back into a dark corner as a door next to her slowly opens, revealing Lynda standing there, propped up by a chair, staring at her with glazed, dead eyes. Laurie backs out of the bedroom, her mouth open in speechless horror.",
    "185": "Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them as the two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small suburban home. Annie walks up to her door, while Laurie looks around cautiously before searching down the sidewalk again. The camera tracks with her as she turns around and glances back down the street. Suddenly, Laurie walks right into a man standing on the sidewalk in front of her. She screams and drops her books. It is Lee Brackett, Annie's father, a tall man in a county sheriff's uniform. Laurie bundles her books and hurries up the street as Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house and pauses a moment, glancing down the street. Several children in costumes are going door to door collecting their treats. She slams the receiver down, and almost immediately, the phone rings again. Laurie looks at it and picks it up. The camera begins on the trees that line the residential street, twisting and writhing in the dusk wind. Laurie carries a tote bag with schoolbooks and knitting needles stuck inside, and a large pumpkin. The sun is a pale glow behind the trees as the camera slowly booms down to Laurie waiting outside her house by the street. She turns her gaze down the street, where more children in costumes walk from house to house, some with mothers and sisters, trick or treating. The wind blows their costumes, billowing them outward. She watches the trick or treaters as a car swings around the corner and pulls up in front of her. A wide shot shows an old graveyard on a windy hillside, and the camera booms down as a car pulls up on the small road in the foreground. Sam Loomis gets out, along with Taylor, the graveyard owner. He glances at a small notepad as the two men begin walking along the graveyard, winding around headstones and flowers. Taylor stops cold and points to a plot right in front of them, giving Loomis a quizzical look. Loomis stares at the headstone that is missing, uprooted from the ground. He shakes his head and looks across the graveyard. Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots. Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see Loomis' station wagon pull out of an alley and follow along. Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint as Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield. Following behind is the station wagon. Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols Hardware Store, and Annie's car stops at the police cars. They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing out the marijuana smoke. Lee Brackett strolls out to the car and leans down to the window.",
    "187": "Brackett steps closer to the object and bends down to it. Both men look down off screen at the animal. He stands back up and looks at Loomis. Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away, then looks back at the dead animal. They glance at each other. Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting and turns to glance at the window. Brackett looks at him a moment, then turns and walks out of the bedroom. Loomis slowly walks toward the window and, for a moment, stares at the rain gutter in the broken window. The camera slowly tracks in toward the window as Loomis stops by it. Brackett draws his gun and the two men step inside. Meanwhile, Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a story. Tommy has his Halloween costume on and a big bag of candy on the floor. He pulls out a stack of comic books from underneath the couch. Laurie glances through the stack of comic books. She goes to answer the phone and picks up the receiver in the den. Lester, a large German shepherd, trots happily into the kitchen, spies Annie and walks over to her, then growls at her menacingly. The house has a dining room, living room with a big bay window looking out into the street, and a staircase leading to the bedrooms upstairs. Tommy rushes out of the den and dashes up to the front window to look out. They see the man as he passes under a streetlight on his way. Tommy runs to the window in the den and points. Laurie walks over with the phone and looks. The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallaces' house. Annie stands by the kitchen stove making popcorn. The shape stands close to the camera watching Annie. She starts to pour the butter over the popcorn but instead pours it on herself. She hangs up the phone, quickly takes off her blouse and blue jeans, and stands in the kitchen in only her panties. She pulls a box of cornstarch out of the closet and sprinkles it on the stains of butter. The shape moves closer to the kitchen window and knocks over a potted plant, crashing noisily against the side of the house. Annie is startled by the crash and looks outside the window. A hanging plant swings in the wind. The shape leans up close to the kitchen window, looking inside. From the darkness of the back yard, Lester springs forward into the camera, snarling and barking viciously. The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog snapping right after him.",
    "19": "She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way. He gulps at the contact but covers his self-consciousness. She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. The two waitresses signal their protests. Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper. He hangs near their table. His discomfort builds in this limbo. The Woman starts to protest. There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin senses that he's gone way too far. A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing down. She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room sofa. Each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. The Young Man stops and looks at her. Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway. She takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough. Carol now goes into her son's room. The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights. Two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption) a waste basket. A night stand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit. Along with some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged into the tiny space. Carol feels his head. Then he coughs -- trying to suppress it. She brings up a waste basket as he throws up. She comforts him. He apologizes. As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack. He palms the cigarette. Resumes making out. His hand squeezes her breast. Then he stops and looks at his hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste. She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth. Seeing the Hustlers. He leads the way back toward the studio. Chatting away unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment. And he turns and sees the naked model. Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes. Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon. Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation. There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity. Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar.",
    "193": "Uncle Billy picks up something, while Potter is seated behind his desk with his goon alongside him. A distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank, stands in front of the desk, mopping his brow with his handkerchief. George bangs the receiver down and turns to meet Uncle Billy's anxious look. He realizes George has hung up and clicks the phone furiously. An ominous sound of angry voices comes from the other room. George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office. More people have crowded around the counter, their muttering stops and they stand silent and grim, with panic in their faces. As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street below. The crowd turns to the windows, then back to George. Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene, and Mary stands watching silently. A man, Randall, comes in and makes his way up to Tom, then starts out. A few other people start for the door. George vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. During this scene, Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out. George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom and speaks to Ed, the next in line. Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. George, Uncle Billy, and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door, then slams and locks the door, and scurries around the counter to join the others. Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle. The four of them parade through the office, and George puts the two dollars in the safe. George rushes into his office to look out the window, then hurries into the scene. An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather, is shown. It once had class but has not been lived in for years. This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on. The rain is pouring down, and a faint glow of light shines out from the bottom windows. George stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps. Bert and a man are working in the rain, sorting through travel posters.",
    "194": "A sharp whistle is heard. Ernie is leaning from the window. Bert and the man are putting up travel posters to cover up the broken windows. Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door. Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler. This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat. George enters. They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy. They remain embraced. They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead. Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head. The Martini family is moving. Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are carrying out the last of the furniture. The family consists of Martini, his wife and four kids of various ages, from two to ten. George and Mary are helping the Martinis move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Mary gets in the front seat of the car, with the baby in her arms. The family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids. In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles. One of them is George Bailey's rickety car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods. The rickety caravan starts off down the street, to the cheers of the neighbors. The kids enter, with screams of delight. New lawns here and there, and young trees. It has the promise when built up of being a pleasant little middle class section. George and Mary are on the porch of the new house, with the Martinis lined up before them. Sam Wainwright is standing in front of his big black town car. Sam is the epitome of successful, up-and-coming businessman. His wife, in the car, is a very attractive, sophisticated-looking lady, dripping with furs and jewels. Sam is watching George across the street. Mrs. Martini crosses herself. The Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around. Potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk, with his goon beside him. His rent collector, Reineman, is talking, pointing to maps spread out on the desk. A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk. Reineman exits. He flips the switch on the dictaphone. George and Mary are talking to Sam Wainwright in front of the latter's car. His wife, Jane, is now out of the car. There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into their car. The big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.",
    "197": "Potter is behind his desk, spreads out a newspaper and mutters. He sees an envelope, looks inside at the money, then indicates the office door to his goon. Potter opens the door slightly, peers into the bank, starts thumping his pockets with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket. Meanwhile, Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope, appears puzzled, thinks hard, and looks concerned before rushing out into the street. The goon wheels Potter back to his desk, where he sits deep in thought with a crafty expression. Uncle Billy runs across the street towards the Building and Loan. George exits a room, having just met with the bank examiner, and sees Violet Bick. He hears a noise, sees Uncle Billy entering the office. Uncle Billy hurries in, picks up the phone, speaks distractedly, hangs up agitatedly, and goes into his office, leaving Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace dumbfounded. George finishes writing something, slips the paper into an envelope. Violet looks at him, says something strange, kisses him on the cheek leaving lipstick, and exits. George opens the door for her, and they are watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace, and the bank examiner. Violet notices the lipstick on George's cheek and dabs at it with her handkerchief before exiting. George sees Uncle Billy frantically searching for the missing envelope, the office in disarray. He stops, notices Uncle Billy's tragic eyes, and enters the office, closing the door. Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, Cousin Eustace beside her. George strides out, searches the safe and cash drawer but doesn't find the money. Carter waits in his office doorway. Cousin Eustace runs to George. Finally, Uncle Billy and George retrace Uncle Billy's steps through the snow, pausing on the sidewalk.",
    "198": "George and Uncle Billy continue their search down the street while Potter watches them through the slats of a Venetian blind. They search a shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room, which has been almost turned inside out and upside down to find the missing money. Drawers of an old secretary have been pulled out and are on the floor. George grabs Uncle Billy by the lapels and shakes him, then jerks him to his feet and shakes him again. Uncle Billy stands with his pockets turned out and empty, and George throws him down into his chair, shouting at him with an almost maniacal expression. George kicks a waste basket viciously as he heads for the door. Uncle Billy, seated behind the desk, starts sobbing hysterically with his head in his hands, continuing to sob with his head in his arms. Mary turns and sees George enter the hall, covered in a slight powdering of snow. He sneezes violently, and Mary stares at him, realizing something unusual has happened. George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap, crying quietly while Mary helps Pete decorate the Christmas tree nearby. Janie plays the piano in the background. Mary realizes something is seriously wrong and leads George out toward the kitchen with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails. As they go, the camera pans with them. Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove. George paces about the kitchen worriedly and goes toward the doorway. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then goes over to Pete. George goes upstairs, and the knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He considers hurling it into the living room but replaces it instead. The sound of Janie playing the piano can still be heard. Zuzu, aged six, is sitting up in her bed with a lamp burning beside her, holding her prize flower. George tiptoes in, and seeing she's awake, sits on the edge of her bed. She starts to get out of bed but then shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few petals fall off, which she picks up and hands to George along with the flower.",
    "2": "We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground. Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV. Now Jane is watching him. After a moment, Jane takes his hand. His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this. Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips. Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself. Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane. He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened. Jane just stares at the plate in front of her. Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice. Jane is sitting on her bed. There is a KNOCK at the door. Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in. She stares at Jane, then starts to cry. Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard. Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out. We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She waves. Ricky just keeps videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt. She has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra. We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily. On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him. She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable. Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters, incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes meet his father's, he knows what's up. Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the floor. From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of her. Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence. In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.",
    "20": "Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action. Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch. Melvin just looks at her. She exits. The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every second of silence during the transition. he gestures Vincent to take it down. A beat and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and the scene -- gone before we can examine him further. where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio. And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins. The three attackers leave. as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear. A single BARK from VERDELL. A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. Melvin is standing against the wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him. Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic little CRYING. As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell. Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings. VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger. Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside. We STAY with the dog during the O.S. VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming. Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room. ignoring Verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick. Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to Melvin. Frank on the phone. As Jackie enters. He turns toward her. Simon's face is something of a horror. The sight is a jolt.",
    "200": "George is seated at the bar, having had far more to drink than he's accustomed to. The camera moves closer to George, who is mumbling. Nick, the bartender, watches him solicitously. Martini comes over to George's side, but George shakes his head. Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual drinking a beer. Suddenly, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, knocking him out. Martini, Nick, and several others rush to pick him up. Mr. Welch reaches into his pocket for money, but Nick and Martini shove him out the door and run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding. He starts for the door, shrugging off Nick and Martini's attempts to stop him, and exits to the street. George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out. The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident, then stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, looking at his tree, and leans over to examine the damages, but George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man. George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing. George stops by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard. He stares down at the water, dotted with floating ice, passing under the bridge, desperate, trying to make up his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump. From above George, a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified, quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. He comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and swims toward the man. The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below. George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.",
    "204": "George encounters a transformed town with nightclubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, and pool halls playing loud jazz music, Gower's drugstore turned into a pawnbroker's establishment, and the motion picture theatre now a burlesque house. He stops at the former offices of the Building and Loan, where a crowd watches the police raid the place and drag screaming women, including Violet Bick dressed as a tart, into a patrol wagon. George talks to a cop who shoves him aside, and he sees Ernie's taxi cruising by. He enters the taxi, and as they pass the burlesque house, Ernie sees Bert the cop and motions for him to follow, indicating a worrisome passenger. The taxi stops at a dilapidated house with broken windows, sagging porch, fallen roof section, and askew doors and shutters. George approaches the house while Bert and Ernie watch. Ernie turns on the cab's spotlight, illuminating the house's interior. George yells out, and Clarence appears. Bert, with gun in hand, rushes toward George, who struggles to explain. Bert raises his gun, but Clarence bites his wrist, freeing George who dashes out. Bert tries to handcuff Clarence, but Clarence disappears, leaving Bert amazed. Bert runs away, and George returns to the house, knocking on the front door.",
    "205": "The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him. It is a cruel blow to George. She starts to close the door, but George stops her. She slams the door shut in George's face. George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. They walk out of scene. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. The two walk into the cemetery. George wanders like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels. George jumps up. George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him. George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the ground, where he rubs his neck. Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different, no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life. Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-satisfied and efficient. George, as he watches her. She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues on. George and Mary, on the sidewalk. Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately. He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself. Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar. Mary comes running in, screaming. George comes in, practically insane. It is crowded. The place goes into an uproar. Some of the men grab and hold on to him. Many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar. Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into George as he comes out. He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the button, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun and fires several shots after the fleeing figure. Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George. The same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in.",
    "208": "A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. As the camera moves up closer to him, he turns and we see George as a young man for the first time. Suddenly, George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, and the picture freezes, becoming a still. Over this hold-frame shot, voices from Heaven are heard. The closeup of George springs to life again, and he brings a large suitcase up from under the counter. The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, and a jukebox and many little tables have been added. There are now three kids jerking sodas, and a man is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George, and Gower is a different man now, sober, shaven, and good-humored. George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter, closes his eyes, and makes a wish. As he snaps the lighter, the flame springs up. A pan shot shows George crossing the street, with Uncle Billy, cousin Tilly, and Cousin Eustace leaning out of the second-floor window of the Building and Loan offices. Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase inside. As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he sees Violet, now obviously a little sex machine, come toward him. Her walk and figure would stop anybody. She reacts to this, giving him a sultry look. As Violet goes by, George and Bert raise their heads above the top of the cab, and Ernie sticks his head out from the driver's seat. On Violet's back as she goes, an elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car that pulls up with screeching brakes. Bert looks at his watch, then takes another look at Violet's retreating figure. Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table, and there are sounds of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling. Annie pounds on the ceiling with a broom. Pop is smiling and poking his plate. Mrs. Bailey is calling up the stairs, then goes up the stairs. A commotion is heard on the stairs, with the boys imitating fanfare music. Down they come, holding their mother high between them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap. Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys. Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out for her and, as he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny.",
    "21": "Jackie breaks into tears. They share a helpless half-laugh, then Frank appears in the doorway. She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse but thinks better of it. He holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror. Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, then he takes a breath like someone about to dive underwater. He starts to look, first giving himself a small, mumbled pep talk. He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror. An establishing shot featuring Verdell tied up in front. Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye on his dog. She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon and he goes nuts. She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty. Melvin nods, a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon. As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat before Melvin, a remarkable event. Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. Melvin slows, observes the dog mirroring his behavior, again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud, puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level. Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes. Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud to the dog. As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise. Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to the door. He turns the lock, then checks that they are locked. Anguished, until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on. Melvin opens the door, looks at the scarred Simon in a wheelchair and shudders. A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply. Simon pats his leg, trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up. Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word. Melvin shakes his head, as if things weren't bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before he's at all comfortable. More patients in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin passes through, visibly drawn and upset. He stops. Eyes on them. They look stricken. He exits. Cheryl, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table, unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and arranges them.",
    "214": "The hobos stare as Everett gives an ingratiating smile, and behind him, the second convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar while the third convict keeps pace outside. The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and disappears, and the middle convict is yanked out immediately after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward, smashes his chin onto the floor, and is sucked out the open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves on the boxcar floorboards. The hobos impassively watch as the three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment. Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom. They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the muck and watch the train recede. Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds. Everett looks desperately about. Both men look interrogatively to Delmar. He looks from Pete to Everett and nods agreeably. Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen. The men turn in unison to look up the track. A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward them. As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw handle. The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs. The flatcar draws even and slows. The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping. The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the blind prophet. The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame. The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate his words. Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men. The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front porch and a dark screen door. The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years old, wears tattered overalls. He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands. Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly at a stick. He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, then returns to his whittling. The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair brings him to table height. Wash glances at the little boy. The three men slurp their stew. He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.",
    "215": "The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet. It is indeed Tommy Johnson. Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard. A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses. Tommy looks back over his shoulder. Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes is mortified. The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and. WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up- CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.",
    "218": "The rumble builds and erupts into a deafening roar. A wall of water crashes through the hollow, engulfing everything and everyone. The cabin is ripped away, and the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their feet; all is noise and confusion. Then, a silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural slow motion, surrounded by scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade and other spinning objects: framed sepia-tinted family portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, a wild-eyed frantically paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it. The churning torrent opens into a lowland, forming a newly created river, fast-moving but no longer violent. After a moment, a pine coffin bobs up to the surface. It floats downstream, and Everett pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish freeing himself from the rope around his wrists. Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air. The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. Dazed, they look around. The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or treetop poking out of the newly formed river. Everett waxes smug, but his voice trails off as he notices something. A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its eaves, and a cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring at Everett, who returns the stare. He shakes off the vision and clears his throat. Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a half-submerged piece of furniture. The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current, and to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place like a hamster on a wheel. Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk. He fumbles in his pocket. Everett shakes his head. Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two are pulling forward out of frame. We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal. The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and Everett, off. The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of frame. A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.",
    "222": "He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the roadside and murmurs. He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop. One of the cows drops and the rest stampede toward the road. Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing. In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes. The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through light traffic as George fires into the air. The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the three convicts emerge to follow him. Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through the door of the bank, followed by the three men. He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table. He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on the lips. Delmar nudges Everett. He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of dynamite. He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as customers murmur. George whirls. The customers stare mutely back. The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to steer him toward the door. George responds, barely audible and without brightening. Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded Delmar. George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the campfire's flickering circle of light. Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money. A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if conducting the music. He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby. The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun shimmering off the rough pavement. The three men stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of ice. A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy Bottom Boys.",
    "232": "A mess. Szpilman goes into the kitchen and from a bread tin takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps it. He tries to cut the bread when there's a loud hammering on the front door. Szpilman stiffens. The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looks around, confused, not knowing what to do. From the other side of the door come female voices, words indistinct. He is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket, grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of his things, stuffs them into a paper bag. The hammering stops. Szpilman cautiously approaches the door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out. He slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops dead. Kitty, young and fierce, stands on the stairs, blocking his way. Szpilman hesitates; she shouts more loudly. On various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out to see what's going on. Summoning all his strength, Szpilman makes a dash for it, pushing past Kitty. Szpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor landing. Another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes past her and out of the house. Heavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street and runs. He darts down a side street. Szpilman lurches into the narrow street. He stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of himself. He leans up against a wall. He removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper Gebczynski gave him. He reads it. Szpilman drags himself along, trudging through snow and slush. He comes to a villa. He goes to the front door, rings the bell and waits. The door opens and Dorota stands there. She is pregnant. They stand for a moment staring at each other. Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room. Szpilman sits down slowly. Awkward silence. He gazes at her. She looks away. He nods. Brief silence. Again, the awkward silence. The door opens and Michal Dzikiewicz enters. He sees Szpilman and stops. He shakes hands with Szpilman. Szpilman, dizzy, leans on the table for support. He and Dorota look at him. Szpilman asleep on the sofa. The sound of a cello. He opens his eyes. Listens. He swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and crosses to a door. Quietly, he opens it a little. Szpilman and his POV - another room. Dorota, partially turned away from him, plays Bach on the cello. Szpilman watches her and listens. A padlock being unlocked. Then, a key is inserted into the Yale lock, turned, and the door opens. Michal and Szpilman on the landing, enter the flat. A large room, sparsely furnished but with an upright piano and a bed.",
    "234": "Three young Poles carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper appear. One man looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package to his shoulder. Rapid firing sounds, revealing the barrel of a machine gun wrapped in newspaper. His two companions also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming at the Schutzpolizei building. The sentry is hit and falls. As if signaled, gunfire sounds from all over the city. Pedestrians scatter except for an old man who eventually disappears into a building. Rifle and machine-gun fire comes from the Schutzpolizei building. The firing is intense. The three young Poles maneuver to the corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building. A battle rages. Germans fire from the hospital. Grenades are thrown, and machine-gun fire is exchanged. Szpilman watches from his window and sees smoke rising in the opposite direction. He sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poke out from a window in the next-door building. The Panzerfaust fires, and the shell hits the hospital. The city is in flames. The sound of firing becomes sporadic. Isolated explosions occur. Szpilman lies on the bed, staring at the ceiling. The interior of the Schutzpolizei building is burnt to cinders. A horse-drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the street, then out of sight. Szpilman sees a man and woman walking with their hands in the air directly beneath him. A German soldier appears, pointing his rifle at their backs. The man and woman begin to run. The man turns and disappears. The woman also turns, but the German soldier drops to one knee and fires. The woman clutches her stomach, drops to her knees, and collapses on the street. Szpilman watches, aghast. He hears voices outside his door, shouts, footsteps, and panic. He runs to his front door and listens. More footsteps clatter and descend stairs, accompanied by more shouts. Szpilman stares at a German Captain. The Captain studies Szpilman, then with a nod orders him to follow. Szpilman picks up a tin and follows the German Captain through a double door hanging off its hinges into a room with a broken table in the center, what once was the dining room.",
    "235": "Szpilman and the German Captain enter through a set of doors. The German Captain's boots echo as they come into a spacious room with faint moonlight filtering through the large windows. There is fallen masonry and broken glass, a couple of chairs, and a grand piano in the corner. The German Captain points at the piano. Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits. The German Captain stands and watches. Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays Chopin. The German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. Szpilman finishes playing. The German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment, Szpilman nods. Szpilman just stares at him. Szpilman hesitates, takes the tin and then shuffles past the German Captain towards the door. The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder in place, leading up to the loft. Szpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him. Szpilman shows him the tin. He goes quickly. Szpilman opens the package, finds bread and marmalade. Then he finds a tin-opener. Snow. The Germans are evacuating the villa. Men carry out boxes, filing cabinets, desks, papers and load them into trucks. He opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain in the attic, carrying a package. Szpilman faces the German Captain. He hands Szpilman the package. Szpilman opens it to find inside several loaves of bread. Szpilman shivers with cold. The German Captain takes off his coat and gives it to him. Freezing weather. Empty streets. Then the sound of recorded music, as a car, with a loudspeaker and a Polish national flag, comes into view, the Polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker. Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he recognises. He's astonished, puzzled. He comes to a decision and starts to leave. Cautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots down the staircase into the empty hall. He goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously goes out. Szpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly. She runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen. So does the man. Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him. Szpilman runs, the firing continuing. Szpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building. He peers out to see Polish soldiers beginning to surround the ruined building, firing shots, lobbing in a grenade or two. The Polish soldiers: Two of the officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts.",
    "236": "Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts are a million miles away. He passes two German officers, who stop. Father stops, turns fearfully, and approaches the Germans. One German Officer cracks him hard across the face, catching his ear. Father reels, collects himself as best he can, and starts to shuffle on. He steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter, continuing on. Szpilman composes at the piano, playing and making adjustments with a pencil to the manuscript. Halina enters with a newspaper and hands it to him. He looks at it, and his expression darkens. The newspaper shows a map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller. She looks over his shoulder and reads. Henryk stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused. Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified. He laughs, but they're disturbed by a sound from another room, the sound of crying. They look at each other puzzled, then Halina opens a door and looks in. Szpilman and Henryk join her. Father is asleep, but Mother is sitting on the bed, holding a purse, crying. Halina sits beside her, puts an arm around her. Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note and weeps. Halina tries to comfort her. Szpilman and Henryk watch. Podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight fingers on the piano keyboard. The hands belong to Mr. Lipa, a dealer in his early fifties. He sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer. Regina stands in the bow, watching him. Henryk is at the table, also watching intently. Szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to Mr. Lipa. Henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him, a rough struggle takes place and during it Mother and Father appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled. Henryk subsides, glowering at him. A great column of Jews of all ages make their way towards the area that will become the ghetto. On foot, on bicycles, on horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings. A great moving mass of humanity, they're watched on either side of the street by Poles. On a horse-drawn platform, the Szpilmans with their belongings. All wear armbands. Szpilman, Halina, and Henryk walk beside the platform with Mother, Father, and Regina seated on it. Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles, and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, who is close to tears.",
    "241": "They struggle desperately, then start to walk and continue walking on. A wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small ghetto to the large ghetto, with few people about, mostly beggars and children. Szpilman and Henryk climb the stairs of the bridge, but as they reach the bridge itself, Henryk stumbles and sinks to his knees. Szpilman gets hold of him and tries to help him stand, then supports Henryk and helps him towards the back of the cafe. Henryk, finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread, sits at a worktop with Szpilman and Benek in a small, busy kitchen with cooks, waiters, and washers-up. A dense crowd of people cross the bridge in both directions. Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and meets Jehuda Zyskind coming towards him, accompanied by the small man, Majorek. Szpilman stops, and they are buffeted by the crowd. In the street below them are cars, trams, pedestrians, and German guards. The name 'Samuel Szpilman' is written on a certificate, and the clatter of sewing machines is heard. Schultz, a fat, sweaty German, fills out the form at his desk, with Majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him, and having a quiet laugh. In the doorway are Szpilman and Father. The small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where Jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter. Schultz stamps the certificate and hands it to Majorek, who gives it to Father. A great mass of agitated people cross only one way: from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings, as a German film crew records the scene. They struggle across the bridge, and a truck backs up. The tail-gate is opened to reveal a huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, bedclothes. Three Jews inside the van start to unload the stuff, dumping it in the yard. Other Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among them the Szpilman family. Each has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother, clothing. The sounds of trains are not far off. They carry the stuff into the warehouse. Szpilman and the others bring their piles of things into the warehouse, which is crammed with similar objects. The activity is continuous. A large room has an improvised partition of blankets to separate the men from the women, with three-tiered bunks. On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, Henryk on the lower. Then a volley of shots and German voices shouting. Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it, and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers. The NCO cracks Szpilman across the face, turns, and goes.",
    "242": "Szpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding. The women watch from behind the blankets, but Mother hurries towards Szpilman and wipes his nose. It is still quite dark. The Szpilmans and about twenty others are lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of German vehicles. The NCO goes along the line, making a selection, using his pistol to prod people into moving. When he gets to the Szpilmans, he selects Henryk and Halina. Then, he turns to those who are left and turns his pistol on the young woman, shooting her through the head. He marches off while she lies on the ground with blood spurting out of her. The partition has been pulled aside. People, including the Szpilmans, are dressing or dressed, packing up their belongings. Sounds of shots, screams, shouts, a piercing whistle can be heard. It is a hot, fine summer's day. Jews, among them Szpilman, Mother, Regina, and Father, clutching their meagre belongings, walk towards wooden gates and come to a halt. Jewish policemen approach and order the people about, pushing and shoving them into line. The gates are opened. They shuffle forward. Szpilman, Mother, Regina, and Father, with others, enter through one of the gates, which closes on them. They pause for a moment to take in their new surroundings. People walk up and down. A young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying. Her cries continue at intervals. The sound of trucks is heard. Everyone looks towards the gates. More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched through the gates. Mothers, children, old people, begging, most of them holding papers. The sun is high, blazing. Szpilman is wandering around, occasionally greeting people. The place is crowded now, packed. Old people are lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether some of them are alive or dead. Women carrying dehydrated children drag themselves from group to group. One WOMAN approaches Szpilman. Szpilman shakes his head sadly. The woman with child wanders off to another group. EHRLICH is haranguing Father. Another man, Grun, joins in. A loud cry from Mother. Regina and Szpilman also call and wave. Henryk and Halina struggle through to them. Halina falls into Mother's arms and they hug. Mother comforts her. Father smiles sadly. Szpilman stands and stares at her. The place is now packed to suffocation. People are calling out names, trying to find each other. The wailing of women and the cries of children can be heard. The Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book. Grun leans across to her. Halina looks at him in disbelief. Szpilman takes the book and reads the title page. The Szpilmans are seated on the kerb.",
    "243": "Their attention is caught by a BOY selling sweets from a box on a string around his neck. He is pocketing money from his sales. Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over. They search their pockets and handbags and hand over to Father what change they can find. He, in turn, hands the money to the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way. Father then carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six parts. He hands a part to each of the family. They all exchange a look, acknowledging each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately. The whistle of a locomotive is heard. The sound of trucks rattling over the rails follows. Suddenly, there is a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the compound. The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt. A cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards are present. Among the great throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train. Szpilman and Halina are walking together. A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon. The rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. Szpilman tries to resist, causing a scuffle. Another Jewish policeman shoves him. Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs. He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads and shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk, and Halina clambering into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered. Father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, smiling helplessly. He raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks. Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders. Heller turns on him. Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. Then he turns and starts to run. Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. Workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them and they pass through the gates. The doors of the trucks are closed. The train begins to move. Szpilman catches his breath by a building. An SS man and Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German. He points to the train. They laugh as they walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street. He begins to weep, loud, agonized sobs, and staggers on. Szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears. He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open, windows smashed.",
    "244": "The boy and girl laugh together, pausing briefly. A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee and pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette and calls to the Waitress, then looks at his girl. The Waitress pours him some more coffee. The Young Woman scans the restaurant, seeing all the PATRONS eating and lost in conversations, and the BUSBOYS collecting dishes. A smile breaks out on the Young Woman's face. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up, and rob the restaurant. In the front seat of a car are two young fellas, one white, one black, both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Jules is behind the wheel. They close the trunk. Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. We track alongside as they enter the apartment building and walk through the reception area to wait for the elevator. The elevator arrives, the men step inside, and the elevator doors open with Jules and Vincent exiting. A STEADICAM moves in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall. Jules stops Vincent and looks at him a long moment, realizing he's been set up. He starts walking down the hall with Vincent, smiling, walking a little bit behind. They move away from the door, facing each other, still whispering. Jules makes a gun out of his finger and places it to his head. Jules just looks at him. THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries, and soda pops laid out. One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway. The two men stroll inside. The three young caught-off-guard Guys are: MARVIN, the black young man who opened the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner; BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. Vincent and Jules take in the place with their hands in their pockets. Jules grabs the burger and takes a bite of it. Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase, and looks up at Jules, closing the case. As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger BLOWING him out of his chair. Vince smiles to himself. Brett can't say a word, so full of fear it's as if his body is imploding.",
    "246": "Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone. Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone while JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe, is present. The camera looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area, where a crap game is being played on a fancy crap table by gamblers in tuxedos and lucky ladies in fancy evening gowns. The Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in and then hangs up the phone. A silver Porsche whips the corner leading to Jimmie's home in hyper drive. Jimmie opens the door to reveal the tuxedo-clad man standing in the doorway. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie. In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up. The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car in silence. Jimmie exits, then returns to hand The Wolf a cup of coffee. He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action. The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen. The Wolf stops and turns around, then takes a step toward him. The Wolf is on the phone. Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen. Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up, with Vincent in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. Both are twice as bloody as they were before. The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. The Wolf circles the car examining it. Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes a bloody mess, but they have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those gun nozzles attached. They follow instructions given by Wolf. He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap and hits the trigger, water shoots out, smacking both men. The two men, trembling, scrub themselves. The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground. Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across their bodies. JULES AND VINCENT are now in their tee-shirts and swim trunks, looking a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met. The Wolf and Jimmie laugh. The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The Wolf slams it closed.",
    "25": "After an enormous amount of time, a seriously clean Melvin finally emerges from the bathroom through a cloud of steam. They exit, and as they enter, the car goes right across the street to a shopping mall. Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly. The camera reveals that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible. Melvin watches her approach. They arrive at the table. He holds out her chair for her. Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up, actually ready to leave. He waves her down. She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly. Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit, flattered, momentarily moved and his for the taking. Carol moves to the chair next to him. She sits very close and he tenses. Their faces are close and she looks at him. Her face moves toward him as he is wide-eyed and afraid. She closes her eyes for the kiss. But now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant. He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense, a lump in his throat as he is trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him. He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he needs help. As Carol enters with some energy. Simon struggles with his shirt and she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so. Simon laughs as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath. We are on Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have Carol sitting at tub's edge. A towel around her, the towel falls and a better than perfect breast exposed. And now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair. He leaves the bed. He takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol. Simon's pen moves across the blotter. Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel. Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to the bartender.",
    "253": "Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. He walks out of the alley, ready for anything, crosses the street, and enters his apartment courtyard. He is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal—the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door nothing appears disturbed. Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. His apartment hasn't been touched. He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door, and takes a quick look around. Butch walks into his modest kitchen and opens the refrigerator. He goes to the bedroom. His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment: neat, clean, and anonymous. Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts, and puts them in the toaster. Butch glances to his right, and his eyes fall on something. What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the music starts, he sings along with it. He drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut. Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see. The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exits Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, and continues walking. He stomps on the gas pedal. The little Honda slams into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts, and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. Butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad-sided by a gold Camaro Z-28, breaking all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. A pedestrian pokes his head inside. Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. Gawkers gather around the body. This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.",
    "256": "A knee-level tracking shot follows a six-year-old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he walks around the trailer, swinging a big stick. The shot shifts to Hi, who is bent down to grab a couple of beers from the refrigerator. Hi raises his voice to be heard over the noise of children playing in the room. Hi pauses to think, then looks down and starts laughing before catching himself. He laughs again, but Hi doesn't react. Hi watches the six-year-old hitting the TV with his stick. A kid in a cowboy hat reaches up to slap Hi on the ass. Hi takes a sip of beer and sees another child finishing drawing the T in FART in crayon on the wall. Glen chuckles, looking at his child. Suddenly, there's a sound of shattering glass, and Glen looks around. Dot sits with Hi and Ed at a picnic table laden with grilled hamburgers, rolls, green jello mold, a cooler, and more. A younger child sits in the middle of the table, occasionally throwing jello at Hi. Dot and the other woman don't seem to notice. Hi sits motionless with a stony face. Dot shrieks, and Hi shrugs, then flinches as jello hits his shoulder. Dot looks offscreen. The scene shifts to Hi and Glen walking side by side, Glen soaking wet in only a swimming suit and wing-tipped shoes. His body is pale except for a sunburnt V-area at his neck and arms. Glen laughs heartily and slaps Hi on the back. Hi walks on silently. Glen eyes Hi shrewdly and stops walking, causing Hi to stop and look at him, puzzled. Glen places a hand on Hi's shoulder, looks around to ensure they aren't being overheard, and speaks confidentially. Glen nods energetically, and Hi's fist suddenly swings into frame, hitting Glen's jaw with a THWAK. Glen flies back and lands in a heap, then starts to run as Hi advances menacingly. Glen shouts back at Hi as he runs but crashes into a tree and drops. Hi drives with his jaw set rigidly, his temple throbbing, and Nathan Jr. sitting in a safety seat between him and Ed.",
    "26": "He sits on a bar stool, heartbreaking. Excited and smiling, he watches Carol holding a pose for Simon. Later, he holds a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter, his style cramped by his cast. He struggles with the cast, then decides to struggle no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from the cast, freeing his hand. He roars ironically, then is back at his center. The door opens and Simon enters, while Melvin is having a room service breakfast. Carol follows Simon out, her arms filled with the hotel soaps, shampoos, etc. Melvin reacts and Carol looks at him. Simon finishes dialing the phone, hangs up, and moves over to Carol and Melvin, totally satisfied with himself. Carol appears as if a load has been lifted. Melvin stalks out. The car is parked near a phone booth. Carol walks up to Simon in the car and hands him a baseball cap. Melvin hangs up the phone. She shakes her head and walks off. The door opens, revealing them. Simon notices some of his paintings and looks at Melvin with some sympathy. Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart. He sits in a chair still fully dressed. A beat, then Simon's whispered voice is heard. As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer, but something gnaws at her psyche. He speeds him out. She's just broken up with him but is being nicer than ever. He enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him. He moves for the door, stops suddenly, jolted, and walks reluctantly into the apartment house. Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty. The windows open, reading one of Melvin's books. He hesitates, looks at his watch. Carol, in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe, walks to her wide open window and looks over. The convertible is at the curb. She hesitates. Melvin gives up and starts out, turning as the sudden blast of being buzzed into Carol's life sounds. He bolts for the door and enters. She opens the door. He reaches her side, half turns to leave. Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part. Carol has not ever heard anything like that before. Melvin cannot leave well enough alone. She disappears into her room, then looks at him. Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door. They walk quietly, Melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps. Though an improvement is seen, it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines.",
    "260": "Hi is shaking his head, and Gale chuckles. Hi continues shaking his head as the camera moves in to a close shot of him staring glumly at Gale. Following the camera, we see the rear wheel, fender, and twin exhaust pipes of a motorcycle, with flames boiling in each pipe as it roars. We view the scene from behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night. The camera creeps in towards a trailer park, tracking towards one trailer with a single window illuminated by a feeble yellow light. Hi, in voice-over, is composing a letter as the camera creeps in on his hunched back at the kitchen table, the only light on being a yellow lamp on the table. The camera also creeps in on Gale and Evelle, sprawled on the sofa and easy chair respectively, sawing boards, and then on a pimply-faced Cashier asleep behind the counter with a dirty magazine on his chest. It then creeps in on Nathan Jr., asleep in his ottoman armchair, lit by the TV, with a half-full glass of milk nearby, his robe disheveled and eyeglasses slid down his nose. The camera finds Ed and Nathan Jr. asleep together in a double bed, Ed's arm draped protectively over the infant. The motorcycle's rumble starts to mix up again, and we see the night sky. The motorcycle tire enters the frame as the bike halts, and the Biker plants a jackbooted foot in the foreground. The engine rumbles as we crane up over the Biker's back, revealing the trailer park below, with one trailer's window glowing with yellow light. We float in towards the Biker sitting motionless by the campfire, his eyes unblinkingly open with only fire visible in them. A jackbooted foot grinds out a cigar, leading into a showroom as the Biker's mail-and-chained fist pushes the door open. We follow the jackboots through a showroom of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures, and the Biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot as he walks.",
    "269": "He indicates Ed with a nod of the head, clears his throat, and turns to the door. His tone hardens again as he snaps off the lights and disappears into the hall. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom, we start to crane down. A beautiful dusk landscape is seen as we float in over the field next to the prison where Gale and Evelle emerged. In the background of the extreme long shot, two men are walking across the field. Floating forward, we get closer to the two walking men, revealed to be Gale and Evelle, both still dyed blue. They approach a hole in the ground, and Evelle starts to climb in, disappearing, with Gale following suit. Elsewhere, a front door has a holly wreath on it, and five three-year-olds in pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on. Focusing on one child, we see them unwrap a package marked to Nathan Jr., revealing a shiny red plastic football. Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle is parked behind a car. Glen leans out the driver's window talking to the state trooper. Glen grins, talking with his hands cupped, much like when he told Hi about the Pollack. The trooper, in a crash helmet and dark sunglasses, listens stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and slaps his knee. The trooper clicks open his ballpoint pen and reaches for his citation book. Meanwhile, a football sits on a tee in the middle of a football field. A cleated foot kicks the football out of frame. Looking up with arms out, waiting to receive the kicked ball, he catches it and starts running, skillfully avoiding and stiff-arming tacklers until he reaches the end zone and spikes the football. He removes his helmet, revealing the face of a rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser. Still craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi, a man and woman sit on a sofa in the foreground of Hi and Ed's trailer living room, suffused with warm golden light. With their backs to the camera, they face the trailer's front door. They both have white hair, the woman's in a bun. The old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl.",
    "272": "Nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper, muttering to himself. Florence enters as he gets into the driver's seat. He hands her the infant, then hands her the copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. He nods as he pulls away from the curb. Ed suddenly bursts out crying as the lights are thrown on. The room is hung with streamers. Ed is entering with Nathan Jr. He reaches for the child and takes the baby in both hands, holding him out at arm's length, pointing him at the various places of interest. The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one. Impatient with the nonsense, he is propping Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch. Hi sits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair. Hi beams at Nathan Jr. Ed smiles at Nathan Jr. Nathan Jr. looks from one to the other, deadpan. They seem to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. Suddenly, Hi slaps his knee. Ed is getting up as she picks up the baby. He is frantically reaching for a Polaroid camera. She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts screwing the camera into a tripod. Absently, as he sets up the camera, he peers through the lens. As she complies, Hi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera. Ed nestles her head against Hi's shoulder. Through his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen camera, the two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended at a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank. As Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as Evelle gets in. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light. By the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become quite loud. He looks up, alarmed. The front door of the trailer. Someone is pounding insistently. He sits up and tenses. He looks around. There is squinting at Hi and she hisses. As Ed turns back to the bedroom. As Ed enters and shuts the door. She listens hard at the door: Hi's footsteps cross the living room, the click of the door opening, silence. There is a burst of raucous male laughter. Gale roars with laughter. Ed smiles politely, then squints at Hi. Gale is admiring the baby. Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his throat. Gale is staring at the streamers and decorations, and reading aloud. Hi and Ed respond simultaneously.",
    "277": "Jeff's attention is drawn to something across the way while he is on the phone. The object of his look is revealed to be two pretty girls who have appeared on a distant roof. He looks up expectantly, with almost a touch of eagerness in his expression. The girls are smiling and talking, each wearing a terrycloth robe. With their backs to the camera, they take off the robes and spread them in front of them before lying down on the roof and out of sight. They have all of Jeff's attention, but he seems a little disappointed. His eyes then become set upon something else in the neighborhood. Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. He asks eagerly and alertly as a girl moves gracefully across the room to the rhythm of music and dance, toward the ice box. The camera is now focused on the window of a small building where loud ballet music is pouring from the open window. The girl, now dressed in a dark and revealing leotard and ballet slippers, begins a modern ballet interpretation. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door and moves rhythmically back to the center of the room, gnawing a chicken bone. She twirls over toward a table with an open package of bread slices and some butter nearby. After putting down the chicken leg, she gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg. Jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one underneath, where a faded, refined type of woman looks up in the direction of the music and adjusts the volume of her hearing aid in a calm routine fashion. At this moment, the sounds of a piano playing a simple but broken melody are heard. Jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees this. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music. On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house.",
    "278": "Jeff quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window, his eyes moving closer toward Jeff's apartment. Jeff is in his chair, facing the window, with Stella beside him. Suddenly, Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm, then propels his chair backward quickly as Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. Both are now in shadow, and Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood, then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. The camera pans down, revealing that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The camera moves forward and pans down, showing that the little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. The old lady, wearing a faded house-robe, is faintly heard saying something to the effect that the dog will get into trouble. The dog turns to glance at her and, apparently taking heed, moves away. Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room and begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. The salesman is carefully wiping out the interior with a dust cloth and has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room. Jeff continues to watch the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought. Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door. Jeff swings halfway around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. She turns around as Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door. She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out the case, and brings them to him. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door. As Stella goes out the door, the camera moves in until Jeff's head and the binoculars are filling the screen. He immediately swings to the window and lifts them to his eyes.",
    "279": "The salesman has completed cleaning the case and is placing it on the floor. Jeff quickly lowers his binoculars and edges back a few inches. He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the binoculars again, turning to glance out of the window. The man moves out of the living room, and the binoculars pan him through to the small kitchen seen through a side window. The man starts to busy himself in the kitchen with his back turned, but the image is very unsatisfactory. Jeff lowers the binoculars, an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down and looks about him, then backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door, and takes out a long-focus lens. Then from a shelf above, he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. Through the view-finder of the camera, we are brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen, his back still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper, spreading it open along the drainboard. From the sink, he takes out a large butcher's knife and a long, narrow saw, laying them on the newspaper and proceeding to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper-wrapped parcel. For a moment, he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. Jeff lowers the camera for a moment and watches tensely. Suddenly he puts it up to his eye again. Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room. He sits down on a couch, displaying fatigue, not carrying anything. Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. Jeff lowers the camera, watching the living room for a moment. His eye travels briefly back to the kitchen, then returns to the living room. The thermometer outside of Jeff's window registers 83 degrees. The camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the song-writer's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano, and plays a couple of notes with one hand while he stands.",
    "282": "Jeff is looking out of the window tensely, as the camera moves in until he is in big profile. From his viewpoint, all the windows are dark, including the salesman's apartment. Suddenly a match flares, and the salesman lights a cigar, the flame illuminating his face for a moment. The camera is now facing Jeff, who talks in a low voice while keeping his eyes on the salesman's apartment. Lisa also talks in a low, quiet voice, with Sixth Avenue visible behind her at the phone. Jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment as he puts the receiver down and resumes his vigil. When the match dies out, only the glow of the salesman's cigar is visible. Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair, talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. The camera pulls back slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray with breakfast on it. She squeezes past Jeff, places the food tray on a window seat in front of him, and peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Stella moves to the sideboard, returns with a table, and sets it up across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food, pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment, then places the breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee on the tray table in front of Jeff. He moves back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled and hangs up. Jeff looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork, and begins eating appreciatively. The hand carrying the bacon to his mouth hesitates for a moment, then stops again before it reaches his mouth. Jeff puts the bacon down on the plate, his eyes moving slightly toward the left, and just stares ahead. The focus shifts to Thorwald's apartment, with the shades up, revealing that the salesman is in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, as smoke from a newly lighted cigar starts to ascend toward the ceiling. The rope-tied trunk still sits in the bedroom.",
    "283": "Jeff's eyes are intently staring at the backyard over his coffee cup. His gaze strays upward as he puts down the coffee cup, but then moves down again. Abstractedly, his hand reaches toward a piece of bacon, but he pushes the food away and picks up the coffee cup instead. Meanwhile, Miss Torso, in a ballet outfit, is hanging up small wash on a clothesline while practicing her leg movements; the wash consists mostly of lingerie. Jeff seems to be getting bored of constantly watching Thorwald's apartment, his eyes straying around the neighborhood and ending up looking toward the newlyweds' apartment. The shade is down, and it's business as usual. Jeff smiles affectionately and starts to turn his eyes away, but something startles him, and he looks quickly back. The shade suddenly goes up in the newlyweds' apartment, revealing the young husband leaning on the windowsill, looking out with satisfaction. He is wearing only his pajama bottoms, and it's clear he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. Jeff's head snaps toward the center of his window as Stella appears behind his wheelchair. Two men wearing tan coveralls are standing outside Thorwald's door. Thorwald, with disheveled hair and unshaved, leads the two men across the living room to the bedroom. One of them carries a clipboard. After a short exchange, he admits the two men, leaving the door open behind them. Stella and Jeff watch intently, Jeff feeling down alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars. A close view shows the two men carrying a trunk across the living room toward the corridor. Jeff lowers the binoculars quickly and turns over his shoulder to watch Stella move toward the door quickly. As Stella goes out the door, she calls back, already going up the steps. Jeff lowers the binoculars a little, taking a normal eyesight on the alleyway. A freight truck momentarily blocks out the side of the alley. By the time the two trucks part, only the back half of the freight truck is visible before it pulls out of sight. Another truck crosses from the left as Jeff quickly puts the binoculars up. They are held for a moment until a puffing and blowing Stella arrives at the opening of the alleyway.",
    "287": "Having completed his call, Thorwald returns to the bedroom carrying the handbag. He goes to a pile of coats lying on the bed, lifts the top two coats slightly, and slides the handbag under them and out of sight. There is the SOUND of footsteps coming down the corridor to Jeff's apartment. He lowers the camera lens and turns his attention to his door. The door opens, and Lisa stands silhouetted in the entrance, back-lighted by the corridor lights. Jeff's head is turned toward her, his back more toward the neighborhood. It's an attractive picture. Jeff abruptly turns back to the window, as Lisa dashes into the picture behind him, and looks out. The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into the garden, nonchalantly. He stops, turns to her quickly. Jeff turns back to the window. Then he turns, puts his unfinished drink down on a table, and goes to the door. Thorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his hand. He puts the light out in the living room and goes out the door. He walks briskly down the corridor. He picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection, as Lisa moves back to him. The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the room. As he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. Jeff watches her. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. THE CAMERA eases back. She comes over to Jeff. Her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration. He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek. Then Jeff moves back a little to look her straight in the eye. There's a pause. She cuts him off with a kiss. Lisa smothers him with another kiss. When she pulls back. She lets up. She smothers him with still another kiss. Then moves back. She laughs, gets up. Goes to the large handbag on the table. She comes to Jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the inside of the case. It is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case. She has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay.",
    "293": "Jeff and Stella turn toward the window, then Jeff grabs the long-focus lens and lifts it up. Thorwald has his wife's new alligator bag and moves slowly across the bedroom, out of sight behind the door. He reappears and puts the handbag into a suitcase, then continues packing. Jeff puts down the lens and turns to the room, where two women watch him expectantly. Stella looks fondly at her ring finger, and Jeff looks at them aghast. Lisa moves for the phone book and hands it to Jeff, who looks for Thorwald's number and dials Chelsea 2-7099. The women watch tensely as Lisa, then Stella, then Jeff look toward Thorwald's apartment. Thorwald, wearing a light summer coat and tie, comes out of the bedroom toward the phone, hesitates, then picks it up. There is a pause before Thorwald hangs up, and Jeff hangs up before Thorwald can reply. Thorwald stands at the phone thinking, then starts for the door, testing it to ensure it is locked. Jeff turns his wheelchair as Lisa and Stella start for the door, pausing at the sound of Jeff's voice. The door slams and footsteps fade down the corridor as Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and watches the alleyway. Thorwald goes past the alley opening, and Jeff puts down the lens, wheeling quickly to the wall cabinet. He finds a box of flash bulbs and a reflector, puts them in his lap, and returns to the window, leaning out a little and looking down. Lisa is in the courtyard below and has reached the stairway, where she waves at Jeff as Stella comes up to her carrying a shovel. The two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron ladder.",
    "294": "Lisa climbs over the wall and helps Stella down into Thorwald's yard. Jeff dials the phone, and a woman's voice answers, puzzling him. He looks out the window, seeing no sign of Thorwald, then glances towards the intersection and back to Lisa. Lisa leaves the shovel on the ground while Stella abandons it, leaving flowers and dirt scattered. Jeff watches Lisa climb the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment. As Lisa starts up, Stella runs towards the wall to climb over. Lisa reaches the second floor and tries to enter through the kitchen window unsuccessfully, then manages to get in through the living room window. She goes to the bedroom, checking a suitcase and finding an alligator handbag, initially triumphant but then dismayed to find it empty. Jeff uses a long-focus lens to watch, sweating with anxiety and muttering to himself. Lisa searches the bedroom drawers and looks around, finding nothing. Stella bursts into Jeff's apartment, and as he reaches for the phone, she pushes his hand down. They both look out the window, glancing at the song-writer's apartment as a new melody starts. Miss Lonely Hearts listens, distracted from her pills by the music.",
    "297": "She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune and still wears her hearing aid. She settles into a folding, canvas deck chair, then gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He kneels down, inspects his flowers, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He notices her but doesn't speak. She begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The strong movements of his mouth show he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away from the fence, startled and a little shocked. Jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. Behind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. Stella McGaffery comes in. She pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark-haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. As she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand, she carries a small black bag. She puts her bag down on a table, takes off her hat and coat, and hangs them on a chair. It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff. A look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it. She swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her. She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down, looks at it. She talks as she works. As she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it, talking all the time. He takes out the thermometer. Jeff has no answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. Defeated, he puts the thermometer back into his mouth. Stella goes on with her work. THE CAMERA PANS HER over to him. She takes out the thermometer, looks at it, gets down the thermometer. She helps him stand on one foot, then she helps him off with his pajama top. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil. The CAMERA is very low at one end of the divan. Jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the foreground. Beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking.",
    "305": "Joe is behind his desk and looks at Vic, who swallows some Remy. Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie, who bobs his head up and down. Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his portable car phone. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. The three men are stomping the cop into the ground. They are completely disheveled, hair a mess, shirttails out. The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still wailing on him. Eddie steps inside the warehouse. Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps. Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange. Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves. Mr. Blonde slowly turns his head towards the cop, then slowly walks toward the cop and slaps his face. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth. The cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes his playing possum piss and walks past the sheriffs over to the sink. He looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands. Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop, opens a razor, and turns on the radio. Mr. Blonde sings along with Stealer's Wheel and stares into the cop's face, holding the razor, singing along with the song. Then, like a cobra, he lashes out, a slash across the face, and cuts off the cop's ear. Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop to see. We follow Mr. Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse, opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of gasoline, and walks back inside the warehouse carrying the can of gas. Mr. Blonde pours the gasoline all over the cop, who's begging him not to do this. Mr. Blonde lights up a match. The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's gashed face and the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be. Marvin starts to weep. We see Mr. Orange, now known as Freddy Newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot Holdaway, and head his way. We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide into the booth to Holdaway. Holdaway is listening to Freddy. Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles. Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words.",
    "306": "Freddy enters from the same direction he exited previously, finishing his sentence. In a wider shot, Freddy is seen performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking lot, pacing back and forth. Later, Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie, and Mr. White sit around a table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy is then seen standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd, with all eyes on him and everyone frozen. A freeze frame shot of Freddy standing before the sheriffs is shown. The camera does a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room, then pans away from the sheriffs to Freddy at the urinal. A sheriff yells at the barking dog, which then quiets down. Some sheriffs glance at Freddy but turn their attention to Sheriff #2 as he talks. The camera pans with Freddy as he finishes washing his hands and turns on the drying machine. A closeup of his hands drying is shown. Mr. Orange looks from left to right. Freddy turns and walks out of the room. Joe lights a cigar. Freddy answers a call, and the camera follows the receiver up to his face. A closeup of Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone is seen before he hangs up. The camera follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment, puts on his jacket, and exits the frame. From an unmarked car, two cops see Freddy walk to Eddie's parked car. Freddy gets into the car with Nice Guy Eddie behind the wheel and Mr. Pink in the passenger seat. The car laughs, reacts badly, and laughs again as the camera tracks across the men's faces. Joe points a finger and everybody laughs. The camera leaves the team and goes to a blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store. Outside, a car whips around the corner into the alley. The doors burst open and Mr. White hops out. The alley is empty. Freddy opens the side door and runs to the end of the alley as a police car comes into sight. Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.",
    "307": "Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing. In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work. Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt. The carburetor will not set properly. Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk. Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it. The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern. Andrea is visibly shaken now. Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office. Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book. Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan. Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room. Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads back into the kitchen. She drops her purse in shock when she sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE by his side. Evan sees her but remains expressionless. He seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it. Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile. He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan. Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out. Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. The rec-room/basement. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly. Panic spreads across Evan's face. Dr. Redfield leads Evan inside. Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass. JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement.",
    "308": "Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. Evan sighs and gives up. Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale. Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason. Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat. Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings. Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively. Guarding his food. Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house. In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall. Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror. Evan walks past some junkies and enters. Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel. He knocks on a door. Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She looks around, waves him in. The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. His eyes begin to water. Kayleigh eyes the wallet. She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table. She gets up and puts on her coat. She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves. Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO- ED. On Evan's bed. Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall above Thumper's head. Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox. Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him. Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but no major injuries. Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail. The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically. Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand. We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a.",
    "310": "Jason finally sits and smiles warmly, speaking in over-enunciated tones. Instead of seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a ceiling. However, his view is blocked by Jason, whose face is now monstrous with rage and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around Evan's throat, choking him. Jason wrestles a baton from under his chin, hits an orderly in the kneecap, and comes for Evan with the baton. Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton. Andrea hugs Evan, who is now in shock. All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter, and jams the fuse into the unlit end. Meanwhile, Lenny paces back and forth next to a three-story mailbox, trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods, the other kids watch anxiously. Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox and sprints to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back. Evan pats Lenny on the back. The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches this and seems disturbed, quickly turning back to the mailbox. He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground, with Lenny falling on top of him. Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being followed. Kayleigh and Tommy help Lenny up and carry him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm, and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as they can. Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance. Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop. Evan looks helpless and lies on a couch. Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles. Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head. He moans and begins shaking on the couch. Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him. Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose. Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out. Evan follows her to a small alcove. She begins to cry. He reaches to comfort her, but she winces and pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise. She looks into his eyes. They lean into each other for a tender kiss. They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd.",
    "311": "Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. Suddenly a FOOT reaches out and trips Tommy. He falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him. Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking. Tommy suddenly lunges at the TEEN PUNK who must be at least a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan. Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's FRIENDS look on helplessly when TWO SECURITY GUARDS SEIZE TOMMY. As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick smile on his face. Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless. Andrea drives through the winding roads, her eyes Tormented. It's revealed she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent. Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car. Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window. Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes. The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Lenny looks back at the model airplane. Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods. As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon. Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously follows behind. They exit the woods to find. Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid. Next to a campfire. Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and SWINGS! Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head. Knocking her unconscious. Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's knee cap. BASH! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid. Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack. Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog. As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and CHARGES Tommy at FULL SPEED. His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground. Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.",
    "315": "She giggles and snuggles into him. He's grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy. The phone rings and he automatically answers it. Evan smiles to himself and hugs her tighter. The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food, and what might be vomit. Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor Theta Chi pledge wears as a hat. As she takes a step toward the table, flower petals shower down on her. She looks up to see two more pledges standing on ladders, delicately tossing petals. Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down. Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever. Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks. Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill. Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off, and the steering wheel sits on the roof. The most unnerving thing, however, is a spiked leather dog collar hangs off the rearview mirror. By now a crowd has gathered. She stares at the collar. Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. He then locks the door, reaches into his desk, and finds a tiny canister of pepper spray. Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs. Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the pepper spray and nails Tommy in the face. Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with his free hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with pepper spray. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad. Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down off camera. Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. Sirens come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body. A security vehicle pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints. Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison.",
    "317": "Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence. Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes. Evan nervously approaches. Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. They continue to stare. Rick stands. Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when Carlos bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch. Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf. Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other white supremacists charge the cell. Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door. Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open. Words from the entry begin to shimmer. Reverberant sounds of barking break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a frenetic blur. Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers it to Lenny. Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand. Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away. Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell. With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through Tommy's throat. Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys the scene in shock. Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and screams when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat. Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer. His original college dorm. Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks. Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of Evan's brain. Dr. Redfield stares ahead. Andrea stares at him blankly. Dr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. Evan looks around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door. He looks in every room of the wing until he finds. Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.",
    "32": "He nods approval to Abdul, then a German appears in the doorway. Abdul starts to close the door on the man, but the man tries to push his way through the door as Rick walks up. Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up. At this moment, Ugarte, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. He gets through and passes Rick. The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him. Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table. If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout. Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs. Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table and sits down. A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks and places one before Ugarte. He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table. Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte and does so. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up. He starts across the floor but stops as Rick comes up to him. Ugarte hesitates for a moment as Rick looks at him steadily. Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room. The cafe is in semi-darkness. During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano. Ferrari, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam. Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number, Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick. Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano. Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away. Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler. Back at the bar, Yvonne, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy. Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne. Yvonne has never taken her eyes off Rick. Rick looks the check over and tears it up. He pays no attention to her. Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him. She looks at him bitterly, without saying a word. Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury. Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab. He pulls her along toward the door. Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab. Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport. Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance. Rick walks over to him.",
    "323": "Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway, throwing the Fellowship into pitch blackness. A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a creepy glow across the old wizard's face. The Fellowship crosses a precarious bridge above deep mine workings and continues up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. The graves are despoiled, dwarf skeletons are strewn about, and goblin graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. The atmosphere is very sinister. The path splits into three passages, each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning, and the Fellowship nervously waits while he sits, staring intently at the three tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. Suddenly, there's a glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. Frodo, nervous, approaches Gandalf. An emaciated, leering creature blazes like a silent flash of lightning. Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously and stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin, and they fall silent. Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt, and Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's scabbard. Frodo draws the sword and stares at its glowing blade. Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something and turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. BOOM! The door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in two goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle. The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn, who stumbles backward. The huge club descends for the killing blow. Suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll, it rears back, spewing green blood. Sam is backing up against a wall, a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation, he swings wildly at a goblin with a saucepan, it keels over, and Sam looks surprised. He wallops another goblin, and it too drops. The cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall. The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down. Merry and Pippin jump on him. Legolas fires an arrow, and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor. Frodo appears to be dead.",
    "324": "Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Hobbits look horrified. Suddenly, Frodo coughs and takes a huge breath, then opens his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest. Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber. They hurry towards a distant door as Goblins start scuttling down the pillars behind them, like cockroaches. Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army rushing toward them. Suddenly, a deafening roar fills the air and a fiery light dances down the hallway. They back fearfully away from the approaching beast, melting into the darkness, the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. A huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall, the ground shakes, and an unearthly sound rumbles. Aragorn hesitates, looking at Gandalf concerned, and Gandalf glowers at the young Hobbit. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway, Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. The fellowship race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo, leaping across a gaping chasm. They reach a narrow bridge spanning a bottomless pit, and Gandalf yells to the others. Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the chasm. They race towards the slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge, but Gandalf, the last, pauses in the middle of the span, facing the Balrog with staff in one hand and sword in the other. Frodo looks back in horror. The Balrog, a massive creature with a mane of flames, rises from a chasm, a great 40-foot man-beast with a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in one hand and a whip of many thongs in the other. Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away, following the Balrog into the bottomless abyss. Frodo cries out, and Boromir scoops him up and carries him away. Frodo slowly turns, a look of numb shock on his devastated face. The Fellowship marches on. Aragorn scours ahead of the company as they stumble on in the fading light. In the distance, the shimmer of a large forest can be seen, Lothlorien. The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers, above is a roof of golden leaves held up by silver pillars, the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks nervously around. The Fellowship is suddenly surrounded by armed Elves with deadly arrows aimed at their heads. Haldir, the Elvish captain, steps forward, looking at Gimli with disdain. Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo. Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a hilltop. They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. Several miles towards the south, a large hill rises out of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others. Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city.",
    "327": "Frodo peers out from the seat as the world seems to shrink. In all directions, views of far-off lands telescope towards him through the mist. \"They will fall!\" Frodo leaps off the seat and tumbles down the stairs. The Eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring. With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger and lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen, below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him and backs away from Aragorn, who is shocked by the movement. Frodo uncurls his fist, and in his palm lies the ring. It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun. Aragorn's eyes are drawn to it, and he freezes, drawing his sword. Frodo hesitates and backs away into the trees as 200 Uruk-hai swarm onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn. Aragorn attacks the leading Uruk-hai like a madman, bringing two down with his sword and leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Sam looks around for Frodo. Aragorn battles the Uruk-hai amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen, while Lurtz orders his troops. Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight, and darts down the steep hillside as heavy feet thunder down behind him. Elven arrows smash into the Uruk-hai. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow, and Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his mighty axe. Frodo stumbles and falls, quickly crawling behind a tree as the sound of Uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out above him. He turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow a few feet away and looks at his friends, slowly shaking his head with great sadness in his eyes. Merry's eyes meet Frodo's with understanding. Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo, but Merry grabs at his arm. Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling Uruk-hai in his path, while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear-guard action. Many Uruk-hai fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin. Lurtz takes aim, and a black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and another brings him to his knees. Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by Uruk-hai. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze, and Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand. Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt. Frodo looks to the far side of the river, and the camera moves in on the ring. Tears fall down Frodo's face. With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushes the Elvish boat into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake. Frodo is already paddling away. Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing. Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backward in the boat.",
    "332": "The strange tower of Orthanc, hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian, rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs and sweeps down them. He moves quickly towards Saruman, grimy and weary from his long ride. Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasting with Gandalf's dusty grey robes. They are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber, then stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere-like shape is draped with a cloth. Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir and sits upon his throne. Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door, horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. He slowly turns to Saruman, a look of dawning horror on his face. At that moment, Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room and slams against the wall, pinned there by some unseen force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff at Saruman, blasting him off his feet. Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. Saruman screams, eyes blazing, and Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp, flying across the chamber into Saruman's hand. Gandalf is flung to the floor, breathing hard, his eyes looking into the madness of Saruman. Commanding two staffs, Saruman sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse, and the roof of Orthanc rockets toward the camera.\n\nFrodo and Sam are walking along a country lane which borders Farmer Maggot's fields. Sam is looking up, and Frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. Suddenly, a figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow, sending Frodo flying. Merry, Pippin, and Frodo pick themselves up, and a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow with angry shouts from Farmer Maggot. Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with Frodo and Sam on their heels. They tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. A winded Pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings, pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. He has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road—small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms, but Frodo is tense and watchful. He picks himself up and looks around quickly, realizing they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air, whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind.",
    "338": "Pippin finishes his bittersweet song and looks up at Denethor, who continues his actions as if he has not sent his son to his death. Pippin turns away, his sorrow etched on his young face. Meanwhile, Gandalf sits quietly in a courtyard, alone and defeated. Great siege towers and catapults roll along the repaired bridge which spans both sides of Osgiliath, heading straight towards Minas Tirith. Aragorn, Theoden, Eomer, Merry, Legolas, and Gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees, teeming with men, horses, and tents. Theoden acknowledges Grimbold, a marshall of Rohan, as he passes by a group of soldiers and smiles grimly as he rides on. Aragorn joins Theoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment. The camera cranes to reveal thousands of men and horses, with smoke from many small camp-fires filling the valley. Aragorn turns to Theoden, who realizes that no matter the numbers, he must commit to war by the morning. Theoden nods as horses whinny loudly in the distance. Theoden looks up at the mountain which looms behind them, while horses rear in terror as Rohan soldiers try to quieten them. Legolas and Gimli move through the camp, with Legolas looking at a group of Rohan soldiers sitting quiet and hunched, no one speaking. Legolas then looks toward Eomer, who is unsaddling his horse, while Gimli's eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones that mark the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. Aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed, with a horse whinnying and pulling at its ropes nervously before him. A ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom, startling Aragorn, who then stares down at the little dwarf. Aragorn casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following Gimli, and all is quiet in the encampment. Eowyn kneels before Merry, adjusting his helmet, and Merry exhales, excited and terrified in equal measure. In his excitement, he draws his sword, causing Eowyn to step back, laughing. As Eowyn and Merry leave the tent, Eomer and Gamling are sitting nearby, finishing a meal. Eowyn ushers Merry off, and Merry hurries off with Eomer watching the young hobbit leave and Gamling stifling a laugh. Eowyn turns on both of them. At the plateau edge, a guard looks down the steep precipice as a horse and rider move along the ridge. The hooded figure slowly rides up the narrow zigzag track leading up to the plateau. Aragorn tosses in his sleep, disturbed by images and voices. As Arwen lies dying, the Evenstar falls from her fingers, and at that moment, Aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand. A guard stands in the doorway, and Aragorn hurries towards Theoden's tent. Theoden looks up as Aragorn enters.",
    "339": "Theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting Aragorn a strange look as he goes. The figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal Elrond. Elrond's face is etched with pain. Aragorn receives this news, ashen-faced. Elrond's eyes fall to the Evenstar which hangs around Aragorn's neck. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. A fleet of black sails moves along a silver ribbon of water. Elrond hesitates a beat. A sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. As Aragorn looks at Elrond, an image flashes in his mind's eye. The ghostly figure on the Dimholt Road. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. Aragorn's eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which Elrond draws from beneath his robes. Elrond's long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal an elven sword glints in the firelight. Aragorn takes the sword staring at it in wonder. Aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. Elrond stares hard at Aragorn. A heavy silence hangs in the room. Aragorn re-sheathes the sword. As Aragorn readies Brego for leaving Eowyn approaches, her temper barely held in check. Aragorn looks over his shoulder at her. Aragorn rounds on her. Aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. Eowyn steps back as though struck. She watches stricken as Aragorn leaves. Aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the Dimholt Road. A light flares ahead of him. A short figure steps out of the shadows, pipe in hand. Aragorn looks at Gimli, grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. Aragorn looks at Legolas as he appears, leading his horse, already saddled. Gimli steps closer to Aragorn. Aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli slowly ride towards the back of the plateau, past the ancient standing stones that lead to the narrow pass. Theoden and Gamling watch the retreating figures of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Rohan soldiers emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see Aragorn leave. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli disappear into the shadows of the mountains. Theoden moves forward. Theoden looks at Eowyn who stands as if turned to stone. She is looking up at a lightening sky. The quiet before the men depart for war. Eowyn turns to the king, her face a blank. Theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. Eowyn slowly lifts her head. Theoden lifts Eowyn's face to look into her eyes. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli make their way up a gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. The shadowed ridges of the Dwimorberg mountain rise before them. It is a spooky place. Silence surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind.",
    "340": "The group rode with only the ominously muffled thud of their horses' hooves on the dank fir needles. Before them, at the root of the mountain, a sheer wall of rock towered. Within the walls, a creepy dark door gaped like a mouth of night. Signs and figures were carved above its wide arch. At that moment, a chill wind seemed to rush out of the doorway. Aragorn stared into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly. The horses reared and bucked in terror, turning and disappearing. Aragorn turned resolutely towards the doorway and walked into the blackness. Legolas quickly followed. Gimli, left alone, hesitated, struggling with his fear. Gimli then plunged into the tunnel behind the others. Much activity ensued as the entire camp was on the move. Fires were doused, tents pulled down, horses saddled. Theoden strided through the camp, Eomer at his side, preparing a little pony with a saddle and supplies. Merry, wearing an oversized helmet and Rohirrim clothing, looked at once nervous and excited. King Theoden broke away from a column and rode up to Merry, then wheeled his horse away. Merry was bitterly disappointed. He stood, head down, a tiny dejected figure, as the mighty Rohirrim on their large horses rode by. Suddenly, Merry was plucked off the ground. A soldier had snatched him by the collar. Merry twisted around, looking up at the soldier. Beneath a helmet and mail hood was Eowyn, disguised as a man. Merry's face was visible under the cape. The valley floor swarmed with thousands of horsemen riding out after their king. Great siege towers and catapults were rolling across the Pelennor Fields. Thousands of flaming torches lit the snarling, slathering Morgul orcs, marching in ragged lines. Flowing torrents of orcs streamed past cave trolls, beating the drums of war. Minas Tirith lay ahead. Aragorn led Legolas and Gimli into a wide cavern, waving his torch through the darkness, illuminating a huge cavern. A ghastly cracking noise, like stone being sundered, cut through the silence. A ghostly figure stepped from the rock walls. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli looked on in horror as a mummified spectre loomed before them: eyeless sockets. The King of the Dead appeared, fog swirling around as the ghost snarled at Aragorn. Aragorn moved forward. The fog suddenly rolled back, forming a retreating wall of grey vapour. Slowly, rank upon rank of spectral warriors were revealed, a dead army of many thousands assembled around the cavern. Aragorn stared grimly at the King of the Dead, holding his gaze. The King of the Dead moved relentlessly towards Aragorn. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were now surrounded by an army of the dead.",
    "342": "Gandalf looks at the approaching Orc Army, now less than 50 yards from the walls of the City. Mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of Minas Tirith are fired. THWAT! THWAT! THWAT! Catapults send their great rocks high into the air, over the battlements! Dizzying aerial shots of huge boulders flying up close to camera then falling away towards the Orcs! CRUNCH!! Boulders flatten Orcs. THWAT!! 100 more rocks. THWAT!! another 100!! The Orc front ranks are in disarray. As the great boulders land among them the Orc start to panic. Gandalf walks the battlements as the huge boulders rain onto the Orc Army below. Gothmog glances up at a whistling sound -- a huge boulder hurtles towards him. He side-steps calmly out of the way spitting on the boulder in contempt. Suddenly! 9 Nazgul dive out of the dim sky, clad in battle. Soldiers throw themselves down as the Nazgul zoom overhead, emitting their piercing shrieks! Gondorian soldiers run for shelter in panic, covering their ears. Mighty wooden catapults positioned within the walls of Minas Tirith are fired! The Nazgul circle low over the City, like vultures seeking doomed men's flesh. Soldiers are plucked into the air by shrieking Nazgul and dropped to their deaths hundreds of feet below. Towers and buildings are destroyed. Chaos as soldiers, women and children dodge falling masonry. Gondorian soldiers send a rain of arrows at the approaching towers and trolls. Too late! The towers reach the walls, their doors crashing down, releasing Orcs directly onto the lower levels. As the Orc swarm from the tower, Gandalf realises Pippin has come down from the Citadel. Pippin looks on stunned, as a huge Orc leaps towards him. Gandalf intercepts the beast, striking him with his staff. Gandalf wields his staff, cutting through the attacking Orc with ease. Behind him, an Orc prepares to cut down Gandalf. Pippin instinctively slashes his sword at him. Gandalf turns on Pippin, smiling despite himself. Out of black swirling battle. Smoke crawls an iron monster! A massive wheeled battering ram. 60 feet high and 150 feet long. Pushed by 20 huge mountain trolls. A massive iron head, cast in the likeness of a snarling wolf. This is Grond. The battering ram from hell! The Orc are chanting as the beast is wheeled closer and closer to the. Gandalf blanching at the sight of this crawling. Gollum leads Frodo up a long ravine between columns of torn and weathered rock. Ahead is a great grey wall, a last huge mass of mountainstone and in the shadows at the base of the towering rock lies a tunnel. Frodo reacts to the foul stench coming out of the black hole. Smeagol sensing his plan unravelling.",
    "346": "Gorbag spies Frodo's body and peers curiously at him, leaning down and poking at Frodo's lifeless body. Sam, hidden in a rock crevice, is swept with shock. The Orcs grunt as they lift Frodo and carry him back towards the watch tower, laughing. Frodo is carried up the steep stairs. From the shadows, Pippin watches, aghast, as Faramir is laid on a funeral pyre. Denethor kisses Faramir's sweating, fevered brow. Bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around. Pippin rushes forward, desperately pulling. Denethor grabs Pippin by the collar and roughly carries him towards the door. Denethor throws Pippin outside and slams the door shut. Pippin races down the steep streets, passing soldiers running back from the burning city. Great balls of fire are hurtling through the air. The city is in chaos. Amidst the fleeing soldiers, Pippin desperately pushes against the tide of soldiers retreating from the fighting. Gothmog turns to his second lieutenant. As Orcs run through the streets, men, women, and children flee. The pitched battle continues. Suddenly, in the midst of the battle, Gandalf turns. Rohan has come. Gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns. 6000 horsemen, led by Theoden and Eomer, step up to the skyline. Minas Tirith lies less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. Over 50,000 Orcs are swarming around the base of the city. Thick black smoke belches from within it. Merry blanches with fear. Eowyn puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. On the battlefield, Gothmog walks among his troops. The Orcs prepare for battle. Theoden gallops in front of his army, issuing urgent orders to his captains. Theoden rides to the front of his army. He rises in his stirrups, tall and proud, yelling in a clear, loud voice. A ray of sunlight escapes through the black clouds, bathing the Rohirrim in golden light. Weapons and armor gleam as 6000 horsemen hold their spears aloft. Below, on Pelennor Field, the Orcs kneel and raise their lances in readiness. Eowyn, her arm around Merry before her. Merry looks on in shock. As Theoden rides past the ranks of soldiers, he runs his lance along their spears. Theoden faces his enemy. Merry is swept up in the emotion and whips out his little sword. All the horns of the Rohirrim burst blast upon blast. The 6000 Rohirrim move off, a great wall of horses and spear points, building up to a gallop like a rising tide, as they charge towards the 50,000 Orcs. Merry, wind blowing his hair, Eowyn's arm around his chest, yells at the top of his lungs. Gothmog marshals his troops.",
    "36": "She can't go on. She lifts her face to his. He kisses her gently. He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time. Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass. It's raining very hard at the train station. There is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by. Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase down and glances at his watch. He nervously checks his watch again. Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice. Suddenly Sam appears. Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens it, and stares down at the letter. Raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing. Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train starts to move just as he boards. From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him. Close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe. Rick's hand reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and he's very drunk. Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen chair. Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table. Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet determination beneath it. Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink. She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes are searching his face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one. He takes a drink. Ilsa gets up and leaves. Rick's head slumps over the table. Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork. Strasser looks at him. Laszlo and Ilsa make their way through the jam in the lobby of the Prefecture. Jan and Annina talk to an officer. Laszlo and Ilsa enter Renault's office. Renault bows to them both. Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment. Strasser observes their reaction. Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them. As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an OFFICER comes in. Signor Ferrari turns around. He's pleased to see Rick. They shake hands. He hails a waiter. He eyes Rick closely. Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe. Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open window in the direction of the linen bazaar. Rick gets up.",
    "360": "Minas Tirith, with seven walls of white stone, seems carved by giants out of the earth's bones. The sun climbs over the eastern hills, sending a shaft of sunlight that gleams against the city's face. The Tower of Ecthelion stands high within the topmost walls. Gandalf steers Shadowfax up the steep streets of Minas Tirith, drawing stares from frightened Gondorians as he and Pippin gallop through the winding streets. An aerial shot shows Shadowfax carrying them up towards the seventh level, the highest of the city's seven circular defensive walls, reaching nearly 1000 feet. A towering bastion of natural rock shaped like a ship's prow bisects the city from the second level. Shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the city's summit, 1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. Gandalf and Pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to Shadowfax. Gandalf hurries off, while Pippin takes in his surroundings, noticing a dead tree in the courtyard with four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it. Gandalf leads Pippin across a flat court of white stones surrounded by green lawns towards a great hall beneath. In the long solemn hall with rows of black marble pillars and tall stone kings, Gandalf strides down with Pippin following. At the far end, a large empty throne sits upon a dais of many steps, with the image of a flowering white tree set in gems on the wall behind. At the foot of the dais, Denethor, the Lord Steward, sits in a small stone chair, gazing at his lap. Denethor raises cold eyes, holding up Boromir's broken horn. Pippin remembers Boromir falling to his knees as Uruk-hai arrows strike him. Unable to remain silent, Pippin starts forward, dropping to his knee and offering Denethor his sword. Denethor looks at Pippin blankly, overcome with grief, then turns his gaze slowly to Gandalf, smiling as if amused. Gandalf looks shocked, and Denethor's eyes narrow. Horrified, Pippin watches as Gandalf looks at Denethor closely before turning to leave, with Pippin following. They stride from the tower hall, and Denethor slumps back into his seat. Later, Pippin carefully lays out a small uniform of the royal guard on a bed.",
    "363": "Gandalf watches as the beacons burst into flames, his eyes flashing briefly with triumph before he hurries off. The beacon glows brightly on the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, high above Minas Tirith. Gandalf hurries to the battlement, looking further west along the White Mountains. Denethor stares at the beacon from the citadel window, a look of black fury on his face. Gandalf, with a strange smile, sees an aerial shot moving over the White Mountains as the trail of great fires slowly winds from peak to peak. A rocky peak high above Edoras shows a great beacon fire being ignited. A bell tolls urgently as Aragorn looks tensely out across the mountains. Aragorn runs towards the Golden Hall and bursts in, causing Theoden to look up startled. Eowyn and Eomer turn to look at their uncle. Tension builds as Theoden, with his head lowered, slowly raises it to look Aragorn in the eye. At the Edoras lookout, a soldier rings the great bell in alarm as soldiers mount their steeds in the courtyard below. Theoden strides purposefully outside, flanked by Eomer and his soldiers, and watches as the soldiers prepare. Eowyn hurriedly pulls on riding gloves, preparing to mount her horse, but turns and runs into Aragorn. Aragorn smiles and reaches past her to lift a cover revealing a sword strapped to the side of her saddle. Eowyn deftly pulls the cover back down and looks at Aragorn. Theoden stares around at the streets and people of Edoras as if he knows he will not see this place again. Eomer, astride his horse, calls to the assembled, and Theoden, astride Snowmane, rides out with Eomer, Aragorn, Merry, Legolas, Gimli, and a great column of Rohirrim, thundering towards Dunharrow in the mountains. Faramir and his men fight a losing battle against the Mordor invasion. Ominous sounds of wind rising are heard, and a sudden terrifying shriek rends the air. Soldiers retreat through the ruins of the city as the Nazgul swoop high in the sky above. Madril is cut down by an orc, his breathing quick and shallow. Gothmog, hideously deformed, stands over the prone figure of the injured ranger, grabs a spear from a nearby underling, and drives the shaft into Madril's chest. Gothmog surveys the carnage with satisfaction. Faramir and a few survivors flee West Osgiliath, desperately riding toward Minas Tirith, with dark shapes pursuing them in the sky above. Suddenly, the Nazgul strike from on high, swooping out of low-lying, murky clouds, tossing men in the air like limp rag-dolls. Across the plain, a figure clothed in white rides towards them, and from the battlements of Minas Tirith, a call is heard.",
    "365": "The Beast journeys past a dangling fish hook baited with worms, a tempting lure sparkling in the sun, and a swiping bear claw, but it isn't worried. Will Bloom, age 3, listens wide-eyed as his father Edward Bloom, in his 40s and handsome, tells the story. Edward is larger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction. A few years later, Will sits with other Indian Guides as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe, pointing to his wedding band glinting in the firelight. While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored. Years later, Edward chats up Will's pretty date to the homecoming dance. She enjoys the story and Edward's charisma, finding him hypnotizing. Will, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His mother Sandra, from whom he gets his good looks and practicality, stands with him at the door, looking gorgeous and happy. Will can't take any more and tries to leave, but Josephine tries to hold him back. As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father. Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him, and he focuses his words on Sandra. A laugh comes from the crowd, and Edward motions for Sandra to join him. As she crosses, it's clear that thirty years of marriage have not lessened their affection for each other. As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way, and the crowd applauds. Edward toasts the happy couple, and Josephine covers well for her absent husband with a warm smile. Later, an argument occurs on the sidewalk with both men a little drunk. Will won't let Edward get the last word, and Edward waves a hand and walks away, leaving Will still fuming with righteous anger. On a typically busy day, Will is on hold with the phone cradled under an ear, sorting through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk. He finds a hand-addressed envelope and rips it open. At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich and starts to eat. Sandra stands by the window, watching as Edward swims laps in the family pool. Edward is born to the water, staring intently into it like a lion in wait. Looking down at the river, Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something changes, and looking up again, it's a younger Edward Bloom, in his 20s, staring into the water.",
    "366": "Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time. Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his fated love. Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back. As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll never find that girl, the love of his life. Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He spots Edward walking back into the tent. Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN. As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him. He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him. Amos smiles, amused. Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he can say no. He shrugs. Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a MONTAGE. CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead. The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes Edward antsier. His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride. Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air. Amos is walking past. Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally. He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the concept. Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. But all he can think about is. CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest bit of information. A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. But Edward KNOCKS anyway. Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck. Edward turns the knob. Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue. Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.",
    "370": "Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward. A black car pulls up and two ARMY OFFICERS get out. Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. Later, Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a tunnel of fabric. Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see a shadow on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze. She knows it can't be him; he's dead. She turns away and with all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket. Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him. Later, under the covers, a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be Sandra. She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. Edward is startled. Both women quickly gather plates. Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to happen. It settles for a beat after they leave. Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving. With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks. Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell. Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it. Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound. A memory. Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. Will can't believe what he's reading. A beat, then Sandra stands. Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered. Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand. Edward's VOICE begins as a memory. On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd. Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as ever.",
    "374": "A beat, then slowly the first blue light of day glows through the vertical blinds. It's very early morning, and Will wakes up a bit at a time, still in his chair. The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand. He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What woke him up? He looks to his right and holds his gaze for a breath. His father, Edward, is awake, silently gasping for breath, eyes open, scared, and confused. Edward shakes his head unambiguously, then nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand and holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink and pushes it away. He wanted something else. It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought, like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world. Will realizes this. Edward nods and looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He sees the end approaching but doesn't know exactly what's coming. Without the story, he's lost, fighting the urge to panic. Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate, and looks to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it, but Edward throws back the covers and rolls the chair himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with him. The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room. Seeing security guards heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down. Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close. Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the Chevrolet. Will lifts his father out of the chair and sets him in the passenger seat. Edward unscrews the cap from a bottle, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself and soaks the blanket. Will pops the trunk. Edward is focused completely on Will's story. Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He honks, trying to get around the jam. Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force. Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back. They reach the same stretch of the river where it all began. A crowd of more than 100 is waiting, including Amos Calloway with the circus folk, Mr. Soggybottom, Edward's Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way. While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet. Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.",
    "382": "He controls his breathing, trying to push through it. She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain. A devilish smile. We are where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment in an Alabama field. He's still carrying the backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip through Spectre. Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top. A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act to tremendous APPLAUSE. As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence. From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd. Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a quieter moment. The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside. A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man. In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. A tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention. He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt. stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will happen next? ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling. ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows. As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos. As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she looks back at Edward. The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES. A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake. Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman.",
    "384": "The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, bounces off, and comes to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. His wallet is tossed onto the desk. The chief leans forward, takes the wallet, and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity. He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card. The Dude stares. The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude. It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere. The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk. He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts kicking at him. The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his face and scalp. The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap. The Dude’s place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped. Quiet. Maude emerges from the bedroom. She is wearing a bathrobe. She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches. The Dude is stupefied. A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint. He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it. She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap. She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. He picks a White Russian off the bedside table. The Dude spits some White Russian. The Dude is staring off into space, thinking. The Dude is leaving the bedroom. The man nervously complies. The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit. He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. The Dude shouts to cover his fear. The Dude is stunned. He is fumbling in his wallet. The Dude looks at the picture. It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. He is holding out another picture. A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape. He hands back the picture. The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. Four people sit at a booth: Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen.",
    "386": "They turn to leave, but are scattered by a strike. Music and head credits play over various bowling shots, showing graceful releases, balls gliding down lanes, bowlers hoisting balls, sliding feet, and a ball return spinning up a ball. The music transitions into boomy source music from a distant jukebox as the credits end over a clattering strike. A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench. We track in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud. He has dark worried eyes, a goatee, and hairy legs emerging from his khaki shorts. He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next to Walter. The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears some of its foam on his mustache. Reflected in the plaque, we see the Dude entering the room with a young man. Pulling back from the name Jeffrey Lebowski engraved in silver, the plaque from Variety Clubs International honors Lebowski as Achiever of the Year. The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look, as does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to. He wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin. Our continuing track and pan reveal a framed Life Magazine cover headlined \"Are You a Lebowski Achiever?\" with the Dude's sunglassed face mirrored under the magazine's logo and headline. Entering the room is a fat, sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair, Jeff Lebowski. He wheels himself behind a desk as the Dude sits facing him and Brandt withdraws. The Dude rises, heading for the door. As the Dude opens the door, he shuts it on the old man's bellowing to find himself outside. A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming pool to a garage. Brandt and the Dude follow. Arcing around a woman's foot as she finishes painting her nails emerald green, she looks up at him. She is in her early twenties and leans back, extending her leg toward the Dude. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them, tentatively grabbing hold of her extended foot. She waggles her foot and giggles. The Dude looks over at the pool where a man is bobbing in an inflatable chair, passed out. He is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.",
    "389": "As the picture fades in, bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the Dude opens his eyes, we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. His head is now resting against the hardwood floor, not rug. The rug is gone. We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway. We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY. Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. The Dude glares at Walter. Walter stares dumbly for a beat. The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to grab the laundry. There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. He flings it out the window. Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle. Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road. Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel. Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper. The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel. The car clunks and screams around in a skid. The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something. As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The Dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air. Walter is just rising from the ground massaging an injured knee. The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away. He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap. Donny is trotting excitedly up. The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space. The Dude walks away across the lot.",
    "39": "Sylvie Gaudet, a French, attractive, blonde woman in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join Reggie and Jean-Louis. Jean-Louis scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly. Sylvie notices Reggie's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee. Reggie picks up a chicken leg and starts off. Sylvie regards the devastated table before following. They pass through a magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond, their conversation continuing. An open balcony runs around two sides of the pool, with sun-worshippers lying in deck-chairs. Sylvie stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. The figure wears a strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The camera pans down to include Jean-Louis, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask. Including Reggie, the man, Sylvie, and Jean-Louis, Sylvie sizes up the situation and rises. Sylvie and Jean-Louis start off, but not before the boy squirts Peter with his pistol. The Arc de Triomphe is at the far end of the Avenue. The camera pans to pick up a taxi as it pulls up before the handsome building. Inside are Reggie, Sylvie, and Jean-Louis. As Reggie climbs out and the driver begins unloading her suitcases, Jean-Louis sticks his head out of the taxi window. Reggie looks at Sylvie, surprised. Reggie walks toward the house with the driver, who carries her cases. She presses the button that electrically opens the front door. As the elevator rises, Reggie gets out, followed by the driver. He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door. The driver leaves. Sighing, she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. Now, the camera following, she goes into the Salon. It is also empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still in the wall. She rushes now, going into the bedroom, the camera following crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain. She pulls open the drawers -- nothing. Including Reggie, in a state of near-shock. We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too-familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin. Looking straight down at the tops of Reggie's, Grandpierre's and an attendant's head and smack into the open drawer. Grandpierre lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.",
    "390": "The Dude is slumped in his easy chair, hand over his sunglasses, with two policemen seated on the couch. A portable phone in his lap chirps, but he waits for the rings to end. Later, in a loft dominated by an unfinished canvas, the Dude looks into the vast space and turns as footsteps approach. Something huge and white hurtles towards his head; he ducks and sees a naked woman in a sling painting a canvas on the floor. Two young men haul the sling back for another push. The loft is sparsely furnished, but the Dude's rug is on the floor. A woman aims a remote at a TV, revealing Dieter on the screen. The Dude, at a bar, pauses with a bottle of kahlua. He then sits in a limo, holding a White Russian, listening to the chauffeur. The Dude mentions feeling shitty earlier but sips his drink, leaving milk on his mustache. The limo stops, and the Dude exits, still holding his drink. The chauffeur, Tony, signals the Dude to look back. A Volkswagen with a fat man is parked halfway up the block. Suddenly, the Dude is grabbed from behind and forced into another limo, holding his drink away from his chest. Inside, Brandt sits catty-corner from him, and the big Lebowski sits directly across, with a comforter on his knees.",
    "394": "He puts his arm around her and drags her on, then holds her hand as they approach a small canvas tent with a sign reading \"TOILET.\" Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight, but his hand can still be seen holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored, and listens to the sound of him urinating. Her eyes flick around the carnival and settle on a tall dark-haired man in a dark jacket who nods. Jody staggers out, buttoning up, and goes to kiss her, but she turns her head away and pulls him over toward the water. Jody follows her as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. He sinks down on his knees toward her and she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward as a shadow falls across them and a gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly, and the gun whacks him across the cheek, causing him to fall sideways. Jude scrambles to her feet and darts through a field. Jody feels his cheek and sees her blond head vanishing among the fields, then looks up to see a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun. A mini drives down a country road with two men in the front and three in the back. On the floor of the car, Jody lies with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head, and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun and smokes a cigarette, his movements slow and somewhat innocent. Jody is pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood as Jody remains motionless. All the men drink tea as the blond woman comes in with a plate of food. Jude enters with a flashlight, moves over to him, and prods him in the legs with her foot. She lifts the hood ever so slightly to peer inside. Suddenly, the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, and throws his body, tied to the chair, over Jude. He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair, and writhes on top of her.",
    "395": "As they pass Jude, she smiles. Outside the restaurant, Fergus marches Dil away. They pass out of shot, and in the background, we see Jude rising. Dil and Fergus make their way to their seats at the bar, where a figure is sitting down. She leaves, and Dil watches her go. She looks at Col, with tears in her eyes. She stands and staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there, with an expression in Col's eyes that makes him feel very small. But Fergus rises and walks out. He looks toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting. She grabs his arm and draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting. They get inside, with Dil sitting inside a taxi watching. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her, and Fergus sits in the back. Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks him on the teeth with his closed fist. Jude drives and the car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. In the car, Maguire turns off the engine and nods toward the building, then toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away. Fergus looks from the window to the car, and Jude turns around to look at him. Jude and Fergus get out of the car and walk down the street, past a brothel-cum-club, to a cafe-bar with tables outside. They cross the street and take their seats by the tables, with the brothel visible down the way. She checks her watch, and Fergus is sweating. The door of the brothel swings open, and an old, portly gent in a City suit emerges from it. The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens. Fergus, walking like any pedestrian toward the brothel, quickens his pace. Jude, by the cafe, watches as a burly security man emerges from the car, walking toward the old gent. Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door, with the old gent's stomach brushing his elbow. Fergus walks on as Jude watches him and the old man being eased inside the Daimler. The door closes and the Daimler pulls off. When it has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back. Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches. She begins to walk away, and Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe.",
    "401": "Jody runs, whipping through the trees, always ahead. The old man pours whiskey into a teacup, then pours Fergus more whiskey. The ferry churns into the sunset. FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust, Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust, hacks at a wall with a sledgehammer. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall, working furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. The wall has the hammer striking it, one brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole. More bricks fall away. Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight, a patch of green is seen. His rhythm slows. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The dust begins to clear, drifting across and revealing a cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the green. Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters through a white door. He dresses, putting on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls, flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil, and puts it in the pocket of his suit. Fergus walks down a street looking for an address. Some distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR. Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looks in the window with the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his point of view, then Fergus walks inside. He enters. She leaves the salon, checks her watch, stubs out a cigarette, comes toward him, and fiddles with his hair. She pushes his head back into a basin behind him and begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo. The hands with the purple nails run over his scalp. Fergus sits up. She begins to cut, imitates his accent saying it, and Fergus laughs. Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. Dil makes her way through it and sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat.",
    "402": "Dil looks at Fergus, who blushes and buries himself in his drink. He throws his eyes toward her again, and she, with her face turned away, sees him in the mirror and eyes him. The barman approaches Fergus with weariness. As Fergus is about to talk, Dil pipes up, and the barman mixes her drink. She stares at the mirror, looking at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink, and a burly man sits down beside her. She slaps the man's hand away and turns back to Fergus, finding his seat empty. Fergus, standing across the road from the pub, is sweating. Dil comes out of the pub, looking around as if searching for Fergus. He stands back into a shadow as Dave, the burly man, comes out and grabs her by the elbow. She walks off, and Dave follows, grabbing her by the elbow again. They stop outside a door on a dilapidated street full of squats. Dil opens the door with a key from her purse, and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing, as a light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters, her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain, followed by Dave's shadow. He begins to remove her blouse as she stands absolutely still. Fergus, in bed, sees Jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera. Jody releases the ball, and Fergus is seen in bed, breathing heavily. Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball, imitating the motion with his sledgehammer. A voice interrupts him, and he turns to see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is, beside Franknum, the cockney foreman. Fergus resumes work. The place is now crowded with people of various styles, all the women heavily made-up. Fergus walks through, out of place in his cheap suit, making his way to the bar. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles, pushing a colored cocktail with a Japanese umbrella toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink and the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way. Fergus takes out the umbrella, holding it in one hand and drinking with the other.",
    "403": "Fergus shrugs, and she looks at him directly before sitting down next to him. Fergus says nothing and shrugs again. A burly man approaches her, suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink, and drags her through the crowd as the barman eyes him. Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door. He comes out, walks a few yards, and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it and sees Dil pushing Dave away. Dave grabs her and turns her roughly, but she beats his arms away and staggers away from him. They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch. She smiles, and Fergus holds something up to show her. Dave eyes Fergus, who then grabs Dave's wrists and upends him on the ground. Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck and presses down, looking to Dil. Fergus presses his foot again, and she bends low to Dave, but his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot, and Dil grabs his arm, drawing him away. They walk out of the alley, and Fergus looks back to see Dave rising. Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs as Dave, holding his neck, is seen lower down the staircase. Dil leans close to Fergus and tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her tenderly, and she goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus. He takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them with theatrical feeling, laughs, leans toward him, and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain and all clap. She takes his arm, and they walk off. Fergus and Dil look at their menus, and a waiter places drinks on their table, then leaves. They walk in an alleyway toward her house, and suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it. The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches off. She looks down toward where the car has pulled away. Another car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus, and she touches his cheek. Dil comes in the darkness, and Fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway. The light comes on, and she takes off her raincoat. Fergus enters slowly and looks around the room, noticing an exaggerated femininity about everything in it. He looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. Fergus's reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside—Dave's. She opens the window door, and they see Dave on the street, in a neck brace.",
    "405": "She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her shoulders. Fergus runs his hand down her throat. She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. They kiss passionately. She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks extraordinarily beautiful. He draws her toward him. He begins to kiss her face and neck. She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders. Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man. Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her. Fergus says nothing. She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. Fergus smacks the hand away. He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet. He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub. She lights a cigarette. Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A trace of blood on her mouth. Fergus comes out of the bathroom. She looks up. Some hope in her face. And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him. He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor. Fergus sits. Col turns to him. Fergus touches her arm. She whips her arm away. She walks into the crowd, toward the door. Fergus leaves. Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus. Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing.",
    "409": "Standing poised by the door, the classroom doors open and students start to file out. Elaine comes out of the classroom and starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door. Ben follows her, moving out of the way of the other students. Elaine and twenty other girls are in basketball uniforms. Elaine sits on the bench, watching, as Ben stands behind her. She turns and looks at him. Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot. Elaine and several other girls run onto the court as a number of girls run off the court to the bench. Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine. There are many other students scattered around the room. She starts to get up and starts to move away. Ben and Elaine are standing at the entrance. Ben remains standing in exactly the same position. After a few moments the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside. Ben turns and starts away from the door. A tall bearded MAN comes out and goes past Ben. Through the window of a hippy jewelry store we see a saleswoman modeling a ring for Ben. He nods, she takes it off, puts it in a box and gives it to him. He pays for it and exits PAST CAMERA, WHISTLING. Ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers. Ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time. He opens the door to his room and steps in. The room is dark. The figure of a MAN is silhouetted against the window. Ben freezes just inside the door. Ben takes a step forward. Mr. Robinson stands at the door. Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall. Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall. Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs. Mr. McCleery is standing on the stairway, listening. Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery who looks up at Ben. He walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr. McCleery, then shuts the door. Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the stairs and out of the building. Through the door we see him run down the street and out of sight. Ben reacting. The elevator at the end of the hall opens and a fat GIRL walks toward us with an envelope in her hand. She walks into CAMERA. Ben driving his car SOUND: An ENVELOPE being read. Ben follows her through the hall into Mrs. Robinson's room. Mrs. Robinson, without stopping, puts Elaine's clothes down next to a half-packed open suitcase on her bed and moves to a telephone on the night table.",
    "411": "Across the fence on the other side of the house, a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, are holding drinks and watching. One of them holds a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds, and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house, while the others are grouped at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up, then moves over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen, and speaks quickly in a fake sotto voce towards the window. He moves away from the window and readdresses his audience. They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the response to his snappy comeback. Mr. Braddock darts back to the window, then moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside. At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full-length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand. The people in the backyard applaud. Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall. Everything is slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. We move out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We move down the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool. He has a big smile. We surface again and pan around for a last look. Through the slightly distorted glass of the mask, Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock are watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house are looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold is nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock is on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.",
    "412": "We go under and sink to the bottom of the pool. Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black-suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it. In a phone booth, the booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway. Ben holds the receiver to his ear. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of very old people start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, a dozen young people, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the clerk behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. He points vaguely in the direction of the other young people. Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk. She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it. Miss Dewitte, who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, Miss Dewitte, takes Ben's hand. Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's hand. Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand. Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding. Ben is backing out. He rises quickly. They sit down. Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table. Ben looks toward a passing waiter and raises his hand. Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically. The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them. The waiter moves to their table. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson. The waiter moves away. Ben watches him go. He shakes his head. Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby. Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.",
    "413": "He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben. Ben writes his name on the card, stares at it for a moment, crumples it up, and fills out a second card. Ben reaches for the key, and he hands Ben the key. A waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone. Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the glass into the lobby. Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away. Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in the Veranda Room. He hangs up, leaves the phone booth, and walks back into the main lobby. As he passes the desk on his way to the elevator, he starts to pat his breast pocket. The desk clerk looks up. He clears his throat and then he kisses her. Ben opens the closet door. She turns her back. He undoes the zipper at her neck. She turns and looks at him. He backs away, slams the bathroom door shut, and the light in the room disappears. The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool. Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds a beer can in one hand. Ben opens his eyes and moves his head slightly. Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire. Mrs. Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil. He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool. He climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a chair, and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and goes through. Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him. He is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers. PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her bracelet and watch. He moves to a chair and sits. Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in front of him, and starts to unbutton his shirt. We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock den, in which Ben is sitting. In the dining room, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward Ben. Ben stands, crosses back to the door to the den, and shuts it. On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits. A television set, facing the chair, is on. Ben picks up a can of beer and drinks from it.",
    "415": "Mrs. Robinson is sitting there when Mr. Robinson exits. Ben and Elaine are in Ben's car, shown from the back. Ben leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in and out of the traffic. He leans on the horn. The car directly ahead does not move to the right. Ben jerks his car over to the right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him. Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance. Ben and Elaine are then seated at a table. Elaine sits with her back to the stage, folding her hands on the table and looking down at them. The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine. The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses, down to a tasseled bra and g-string, twirling the tassels. Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper, and turns back. Later, Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls her arm away. Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him. She keeps looking away and starts to cry. People on the sidewalk are looking at them. She turns away from them. Ben moves away from them and around in front of her. She brings both hands up to her face. Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony. Then, very determined, he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face. She looks up startled and starts to give a little cry, but before she can, he is kissing her. She closes her eyes. He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face. He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands. Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on. After a while, she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side. He looks at her. She is watching him carefully. A car with a couple of teenagers has driven up in the slot on their right. Its radio is tuned into a rock and roll station and is playing loudly. Ben leans across Elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel. The kid turns the radio up. Ben and Elaine roll their windows up. From outside of the car, Ben is talking with great animation—Elaine is watching him. They are both eating as Ben talks, telling Elaine a story. Their windows are rolled up.",
    "416": "The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson house. They sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's hand touching her shoulder. There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off the road. Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door. They start in a few steps. ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out. CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY. A BELLBOY passes them. The room clerk smiles at them. Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby, passing Ben and Elaine. Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch. Ben and Elaine are in his car. He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes. He turns off the ignition and the lights. He puts his head down on the steering wheel. He lifts his head. She nods. He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. He freezes with his hand still on the key. He turns off the engine. He starts the car and drives out. It is raining. On the seat beside Ben is a package. From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift. Ben's right hand is on it as he drives. Past Ben and through the windshield as the Robinson house comes closer and closer. The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passenger side and climbs in. Ben starts the car forward down the driveway. As they drive, Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block. There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression. Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package. TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the driveway toward the Robinson house. Ben gets to the front door. Ben runs up the stairs. He still carries the package. Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom. She is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe. Ben pushes her back into her room. Ben turns and looks. Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house. He holds her against the wall in the corner. Back in the corner.",
    "417": "Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder. Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring. She moves toward him as though to hit him. Elaine slams the door shut. Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben. He looks at her in horror. She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream. Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fishtank, smoking. Ben drives by in his car. He looks at the house. Ben, dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking the backyard. Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop. Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's window. Ben moves aside. Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house. In the driveway of the Robinson house, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car. Mr. Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car. Mrs. Robinson stands at the door. Mr. Robinson gets into the car and starts it. The car drives down the driveway and down the street. Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk. He is writing. On the piece of paper is written: DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several dozen times. He stops and looks up. It is early morning. We see a swinging door pushed open to reveal: Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree. Ben stands inside the door. Mr. Braddock starts to smile. Ben driving his car. The campus is empty except for Ben who, dressed carefully in his black suit, sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of Wendell Hall. During which Ben remains static while the quadrangle and the area around him fill up with students; walking, talking, hurrying to class, strolling, sitting, reading, handing out petitions, etc. Elaine comes out. She walks, carrying her books, in Ben's direction. Approaching from the distance. As she walks, she is joined by another GIRL with whom she converses as they walk. Watching. As they approach, they are joined by a tall BOY with a beard. He starts toward them, falters, straightens himself. Mr. McCleery stops and turns. Ben almost runs into him. Mr. McCleery takes a couple of steps up, Ben following and stops again. Mr. McCleery takes a couple more steps and stops again. He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall. The lady sitting next to Elaine takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again.",
    "421": "He stops for a moment to look at his hands. The casts are off. He knocks on the door with his wrist, as he would if he still had them on. When she opens the door he holds them up boyishly before her face. She kisses his hands. Eddie flexes his fingers, then tries out a shot on one of Johnny's pool tables. He uses the simpler, open hand bridge to support his cue. Bert Gordon enters, and watches him play. Bert smiles at Eddie. Eddie and Sarah enter a quiet, elegant restaurant, one with soft piano music and subdued lighting. They had walked past it the first day they met. She has on new dress and Eddie, looking a little ill at ease, has on a suit and tie. The headwaiter seats them at a table. Eddie and Sarah exchange smiles. A waiter approaches. Suddenly she breaks into laughter. The waiter returns with the bottle of sherry and holds it out to Eddie for his approval. There is a long pause as Eddie looks from the bottle to the waiter. Finally, Eddie realizes he must respond. The waiter pours out the sherry as Eddie and Sarah stare at each other over their glasses. Then Eddie looks away. Sarah proposes a toast. They touch glasses. The waiter brings the check. Eddie nods and drinks down the last of his brandy as the waiter leaves. Sarah sees that Eddie seems somber, preoccupied. She picks up her purse and gloves and leaves. It is raining heavily. Sarah emerges from the building and leans wearily against the awning. Eddie, having hurriedly paid the bill, follows after her. He catches up with Sarah, taking her by the arm, and stepping out into the street to hail a cab. She angrily breaks away from him and walks out into the rain. Eddie grabs Sarah and starts to pull her back under the awning. The door opens and the two of them enter, thoroughly drenched. She walks to a chair, limping noticeably. He reaches across and pulls her to him, burying his face in her head. Bert Gordon leans on the hood of a cab. His face drops when he sees Eddie and Sarah walking toward him. Eddie carries two suitcases and his leather cue case. He sets the suitcases on the curb and the cab driver moves to take them. Courteously, Bert opens the door of the taxi for Eddie and Sarah. Sarah eyes Bert distrustfully and starts to get in the cab. Eddie, Sarah, and Bert squeeze through the door of the train compartment. The redcap exits, carrying the luggage. Eddie shuts the door. Bert and Sarah sit across from each other.",
    "423": "Findley spots Bert, takes a long drag on his cigarette, and saunters toward them. Bert points to Eddie and snaps his fingers, pretending to forget Findley's name. He nods to them all and leaves. Sarah gives Bert a look. The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah, descending the stairs, looking on at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent. She moves slowly, dreamily past the combo, past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress, past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her side. He leans over and whispers something in her ear. Her face hardens. Angrily she turns and throws her champagne in his face and smashes her glass on the floor. Then she starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders. The music stops. The dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd. Eddie tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words. Eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs. Bert watches them go, wiping the champagne off his coat lapels. The music starts up again. A Negro maid sits patiently in the room, watching over Sarah and the coats that Sarah is lying on. A woman enters and, disgusted, pushes Sarah off her fur coat. Eddie appears in the doorway. The woman takes her coat and leaves. Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out. Findley, drink and cork-tipped cigarette in hand, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his game room. It is a beautifully appointed salon, wood-paneled, filled with plush divans and decorated with terra cotta Roman statuary. In the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth. Findley goes to the bar. Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table. But it's not a pool table -- it's a billiard table. Eddie finishes uncovering the table.",
    "428": "In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table, bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder. The balls are returned and Eddie makes his break shot, a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table. Eddie looks up, with a smile. Fats walks around the table and peers at the balls. Placing his cigarette on the wooden rim of the table, Fats rams the cue ball into the pack, dropping the six ball into the pocket. The table is now his. Eddie sits down unhappily. Fats plays quickly, moving from shot to shot with studied authority, his eyes and hands working fluidly together. The shot goes in. As Eddie watches, the prancing, elegant Fats maneuvers around the table. The shot goes in. We see Fats' bejeweled fingers curl around the cue stick, the stick then darting out to send a ball caroming off a far bank and into a side pocket. Fats keeps sinking shots. It is eleven o'clock. Eddie is up. The crowd at Ames sits stolidly in their seats, watching each player, each move. The shot goes in and he lines up another. The shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls. As it rolls in, the crowd breaks into applause, and Fats bangs the butt of his cue stick on the floor to show his appreciation. So Eddie does the same. Fats peers at the pack of balls huddled together, then points to one that lies in the middle of the pack. Big John looks around -- the shot seems impossible. Fats slams the cue ball into the pack. The balls carom outward in all directions. Only the seven rolls slowly into the corner pocket. Eddie slumps back in his seat as the crowd applauds. It is twelve o'clock, and Fats dominates the play. As he calls out the litany of his shots, we see, superimposed over his hands and his face and the sound of socking pool balls, the spectators, stupefied by the action; Charlie, swallowing hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play; and the bills endlessly unfolding out of Charlie's hands and floating onto the table. One-thirty and Fats is still shooting. The shot rolls in. The shot goes in. Fats pounds his stick on the floor. Fats allows a perfunctory bow of his head, a courtly gesture, to Eddie's manager. Charlie looks away, avoiding his eyes. Now it's Eddie's voice we hear calling out the shots. He circles the table, a proud, cocky smile on his face, and superimposed over his movements we see the spectators, hunched up in their chairs, and Fats' face, glowering, hostile.",
    "431": "Eddie looks over at Charlie, asleep in the next bed. He rolls out of bed, goes to the window, and sees a neon sign flashing across the street that reads AMES BILLIARDS. Eddie returns to his bed, leaves the keys to the Packard and some money on the night table next to Charlie. He picks up his valise, his hanging bag, and his leather cue case, then goes toward the door. As Eddie enters carrying his bags, a few early morning travelers—some soldiers and a man in a Stetson hat—pass him by. He has been up all night and is in a typical bus station washroom at that time of the morning. The residue of a full day's traveling is in evidence: crumpled paper towels, cigarette butts, etc. Part of the residue is a drunk who sits on the shoeshine seat, fast asleep. Eddie looks at him, shaking his head. A sign on the wall reads IS THIS YOUR LUCKY DAY? Eddie laughs to himself, puts his hanging bag and cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the mirror. A wizened old attendant sits nearby. The attendant, whose every move seems to require a tremendous effort, shuffles over and grabs a towel as Eddie removes his jacket. Near the row of coin lockers in the waiting room is a small lunch counter and several tables. At one table, facing the lockers, is a young woman, Sarah: a book is open before her, and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears, then her eyes return to the printed page. He locks his bags in a locker. He now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven. Moving toward the counter, Eddie notices Sarah. He goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her. He sniffs some wrapped sandwiches. Eddie wanders over to a table next to Sarah's and sits down. She ignores him and returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence. There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-sufficiency, about her. And a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation—or the lack of it. Sarah goes back to reading. The waitress arrives to take Eddie's order. Eddie holds up two fingers to the waitress, who departs. The coffee comes. Eddie leans back against the wall and shuts his eyes. He slips off to sleep. The waitress brings a check.",
    "437": "Don enters the living room, which is in disarray with books on the floor, furniture misplaced, and clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Only the telephone, next to an open portable typewriter, is active, ringing. Don, however, does not answer it. Instead, he notices a bottle and a glass by the big chair. He moves towards it, picks up the bottle, and empties its remaining contents into the glass. Two empty bottles and a sticky glass are nearby, and the portable typewriter has a nearly blank sheet of paper in it. Don takes the two empty bottles and holds them over the glass, yielding first one slow drop, then two more meagre drops that barely stain the bottom of the glass. He empties these drops into his throat, then quickly checks his pockets for money. He has exactly two cents. He looks around the apartment and spots the typewriter on the desk. He walks towards it, removes the sheet of paper, closes the typewriter, and picks it up. He drags it to the little hall, puts on his hat, steps over two newspapers and two bottles of milk, and starts down the stairs. A note from Helen is still pinned to the door as he leaves the house with the typewriter. He encounters a steel gate drawn across the pawn shop's entrance and is confused. He notices a woman standing nearby with a baby carriage and straightens up under her stare. In the next block, he sees another pawn shop and starts towards it, each step painful. He leans against the elevated train tracks, shaking, as a trolley car passes and he continues to cross the street. The second pawn shop is also closed. He peers through the iron gate into the dark shop, then turns around and sees a third pawn shop across the street. Sweat pours from his forehead as two men stand grinning nearby. He picks up the typewriter and starts walking back.",
    "439": "They wear terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas, canvas slippers on their feet. In the listless, burned-out collection, Don is the only person who moves with purpose. There are canvas slippers on his feet. Sitting on them and milling aimlessly around, are some thirty alcoholics. It is L-shaped, about fourteen feet wide. He goes around the bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard. Don goes to the door, tries to open it. At this moment the door is opened by another male nurse, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillow cases. Don tries to take advantage of the opening of the door to get out, but the guard pulls him by the arm, while the entering nurse locks the door with his own key. Don turns. At the bend of the corridor stands Bim, with a tumbler of medicine in his hand. Don approaches him slowly. He points at a man in a wheel-chair. Bim seats Don on his bed. He points to the man with the sensitive face, who stands against the wall. It is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors. On his cot lies Don, his eyes wide open. Don pivots in the direction of the sound. On a cot in the corner is the man with the sensitive face and the addiction to beetles. He is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning. He rises and begins to slap the wall and scream. Don stares at him through the dimness. Through the glass doors come two male nurses with flashlights. They run to the cot of the D.T. victim. There is a wild scrabble as he fights them off. One of the nurses races back to the door and calls. A third nurse races in, throws a straitjacket to the first nurse, hurries to one of the other beds. Seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on which are hypodermic syringes, etc. He enters the ward and dashes in the direction of the beetle patient. The doctor must have been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung a dark blue overcoat. As he goes, he tosses the overcoat on the empty cot next Don. Don looks after the doctor, then is fascinated by the coat lying beside him. In the corner the three nurses and the doctor are working over the beetle patient, the doctor giving him a hypo, the nurses getting him into the straitjacket. He looks at Don. As his gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas slippers.",
    "441": "Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door as Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. She bangs on the door, rattling the doorknob helplessly. Still no answer, and she raps on the door again. Don sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray his presence. He is bathed in sweat, tears of terror in his eyes, staring at the door. She turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her door, peering up. She hurries to the stairwell and calls down it. Don's eyes are on the door, now focusing on the door chain. He realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but it's not too late. With a desperate effort, he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door. Don is almost at the door. With his last strength, Don raises himself against the door, stretches out his hand, gets the door chain, tries to slip it in its notch, but misses. Dave, the janitor, a ring with labeled keys on it in his hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the door is open. Don throws all his weight against the door but it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway. She stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen enters, closing the door behind her. A shaft of light comes from the corridor. Don crouches behind the door. She kneels down beside Don. They are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on. She leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained wall. She seats him on the bed. She turns on the bed lamp. Don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room. On the armchair near the kitchen door lies Helen's leopard coat. Helen lies asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from Wick's bed. In the door to the bedroom stands Don. He wears the dark suit (the one he wore to the opera) and as his eyes shift from Helen to the coat, he is just tying his tie. Very cautiously he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard coat and starts towards the entrance door. Just as he is slipping out, he shuts the door behind him. She flings open the door and runs out. In the next second Helen hurries into the shot. She is wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. Helen runs to the banister and looks down. She is barefooted, just wearing the foulard dressing gown.",
    "443": "Helen and Wick watch Don. Don's face relaxes into an innocent grin and his eyes meet Helen's. Hers are infinitely distressed. Wick has twisted the string off the bottle. With the bottle in his hand, Wick goes through the living room toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him, then follows him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Wick has stepped to the sink. He opens the bottle, turns it upside down and lets the whiskey run out. Helen trails after them, acutely embarrassed. Don and Helen come to the door from the living room and stand watching. Don has something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of a very good friend, but he senses Helen's eyes upon him and preserves his nonchalant expression. The bottle emptied, Wick puts it in the sink. Wick shrugs and goes to the hall for his hat. She kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. She turns to go, but Don holds her back. Then, so that he won't see her moist eyes, she turns and hurries into the entrance hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has followed Helen to the entrance hall. Helen comes out quickly and taking a handkerchief from her bag, hurries past Wick into the hall. Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open. He goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don steps quickly to the door, presses his ear against it to hear what the two are saying outside. It is narrow and simple. Every so often down the stair there is a light bracket, always burning. A skylight, somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor back. They descend a few steps. Wick takes her arm quickly. They go on down the stairs. Don stands at the door, panic in his face. Has his brother discovered the other two bottles? He puts the chain on the door to insure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom. Don dashes in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register in the side wall, pries it out with the file, looks inside, puts his hand in. He looks at the hole wide-eyed, pushes back the grille and runs out. Don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches under the side of it which was towards the wall. His hand explores among the springs. He sits up. His face is covered with sweat. He takes out his handkerchief and wipes his face. Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is the noise of a key being turned in the lock. It opens as far as the chain will allow, stops with a sharp bite of metal on wood.",
    "448": "Don Birnam, dressed in a light summer suit and carrying a florist's box under his arm, paces up and down the lobby while keeping an eye on the elevator doors. He walks towards a circular plush settee, sits down, places the flower box next to him, and adjusts his tie, still watching the elevators. On the other side of the settee, a middle-aged couple, Mr. and Mrs. St. James, are seated. Mr. St. James wears a linen suit and a yellowing panama hat, while Mrs. St. James is a cheerful little woman with glasses pinned to her dress. Don overhears their conversation and eventually realizes they are Helen's parents. Uncomfortable, he leans his head back, then picks up the florist's box, rises, and moves away from the settee. Once behind some potted palms, he looks back just as Helen enters through a revolving door, wearing a new spring suit. She sees her parents, greets them, and they discuss Don's anticipated arrival. Don, undecided, locates the public telephone booths and steps into one. He deposits a nickel, dials the Hotel Manhattan, and watches through the glass door. Helen, noticing his absence, uses a house phone to speak briefly before hanging up and rejoining her parents, looking crestfallen. Don emerges from the booth, careful not to be seen, and exits through a side door. Later, Wick enters a dim room to find Don lying on a couch with an empty bottle on the floor beside him and a half-filled glass in his hand. Wick turns on the light, removes his hat, and tosses his briefcase into a chair. As he enters the living room, he notices Don's presence. Don puts his arm over his face, and Wick snaps off the light.",
    "449": "Wick goes and sits beside Don, taking the glass from his hand. He has bent over Don and loosened his tie. Paying no attention to the sound of steps from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short. Wick freezes. Don sits up on the couch. Don, clinging to Wick's arm, pulls himself up. Wick pushes him through the doorway to the dark bedroom, closing the door after him. He snaps on the lights in the living room, rolls the empty bottle under the couch, takes the glass of whiskey, puts it behind the pile of records. As he is starting towards the door, the bottle rolls from under the couch. From under the couch has rolled the bottle. Wick stops and rolls it back again, then goes into the hall and opens the door. As Helen speaks, he tries to get near it without her noticing. Suddenly she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under the couch. He walks over to the records and picks up the glass. He stands with his head against the door post, listening, harassed. Helen comes into the living room. He takes a drink. Wick stands, the glass of whiskey in his hand, startled taut at the sight of Don who comes in, not too steady on his feet. Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back. Helen comes back into the room, staring at Don. She is beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass in Wick's hand. He takes the glass out of Wick's hand. He opens the drawer, takes out two bullets, holds them in the palm of his hand. Helen looks at him for a second, then takes off her hat and throws it into a nearby chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette. She raises herself to her tiptoes and kisses him warmly. Nat and Don alone. Nat is behind the bar, putting toothpicks into olives which he takes from a bowl and arranges in a row on a plate. Don jumps up. He jumps up, runs back to the bookcase, starts pulling out books, row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, pulls out all its contents, throwing them on the floor. He goes back to the big chair, throws himself down, exhausted. His eyes fall again on the empty bottle and the empty glass. Something is written on it but it is distorted by the glass.",
    "452": "Westley examines where the flames burst over Buttercup. He then grabs her, pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up. Buttercup is frozen with fear. Westley takes her hand, gently leads her forward as they move slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle. Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, and goes right on talking without missing a beat. He takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow, and the vines groan as they fall. Westley has been chatting away the entire time. He picks Buttercup up again, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch. The two of them have by now crossed the pond. Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way—it's Lightning Sand—a great patch of it, and it has her—a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone. Westley whirls, slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half—it's still connected to the tree. Then he grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. Now nothing can be seen, just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal. Then a giant R.O.U.S. darts into view. The R.O.U.S.—a Rodent of Unusual Size—is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes. The lightning sand, as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine. Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes, her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues to pull them to safety, the R.O.U.S., high above them, watches. Buttercup, placed against a tree, Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face. The R.O.U.S on a much lower branch now, it stares down at Westley. Westley stares back up at the beast. Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her. Now there are two R.O.U.S.'s. They have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down. Westley, picking her up, puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking.",
    "453": "As Westley speaks, a R.O.U.S. attacks him from off-screen, sinking its teeth deep into his arm. Westley punches the beast and reaches for his sword, but the R.O.U.S. returns, initiating a fierce battle. Just as it seems Westley can't win, he flips the rodent away and scrambles for his sword. The R.O.U.S. then targets Buttercup, who is terrified. They summon strength and increase their pace, reaching the edge of the Fire Swamp, where they unexpectedly encounter Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him, and three armed warriors mounted behind. Buttercup looks exhausted, and Westley looks worse. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. Buttercup looks around, noticing armed warriors with crossbows aimed at Westley from multiple directions, blocking any escape. Humperdinck and Westley turn to face her, and Buttercup tries to speak but is swept onto Humperdinck's horse, and they leave. Westley stares after her as Rugen's warriors bring him to the Count, who clubs Westley across the skull, causing him to fall unconscious. Westley wakes up in a dank, underground cage, chained and helpless. An Albino enters, carrying a tray of food and medication, and tends to Westley's wounds. Westley winces as the Albino studies him, nodding and shaking his head. Meanwhile, Buttercup, looking sad and possibly ill, wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle, unseeing as Humperdinck and Rugen watch her. The camera holds on her as the Grandfather's voice reads. The courtyard is packed with people, and Humperdinck, Rugen, and the Queen stand high on the balcony.",
    "455": "The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. There are two large tubs, one filled with steaming water, the other with icy water. Without a word, Fezzik stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then pulls him out and ducks him into the steaming water, and after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot. A wild look hits Inigo. Yellin enters and kneels, showing the key dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters. The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck. The Prince whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever, and calls out. Prince Humperdinck shoves the lever all the way up. There has never been such pain. A few children pale, bolt toward their parents. The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes at his chest. The Albino shakes his head and says nothing. Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head. The Albino drops without a sound. Inigo kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees and starts to talk, his voice low and strange. Inigo rises, eyes still closed, and walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind, walking blind through the grove of trees. Inigo moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. Inigo stops. For a long moment, he stands frozen. Suddenly, he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot—nothing. He has failed. In utter despair, he collapses against the tree, against a knot in the tree, against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. Fezzik and Inigo look at each other, then start down. Westley is dead by The Machine. Fezzik leans over him, listening for a heartbeat, then looks at Inigo and shakes his head. For a moment, he just sags. Inigo is in despair. We're back in the Pit. For a moment, he just sags. Inigo, Fezzik, and Westley approach the door. They knock. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. Inigo pounds again. He shuts the window. They rap on the door. Inigo and Fezzik hurry inside. Fezzik carries Westley, who is just starting to stiffen up a little.",
    "456": "He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp. He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. He goes to get a huge bellows. Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. He stops pumping. And he presses lightly on Westley's chest. And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we. It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed. He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. FEZZIK helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. WESTLEY, absolutely stunned. He shakes his head from side to side. Inigo and FEZZIK do. They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind. BUTTERCUP, in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. BUTTERCUP, and she couldn't seem more serene. WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK, looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands. Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing clergyman imaginable. Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door. He has an impediment that would stop a clock. THE BRUTES AND YELLIN, by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. And it is a bit unnerving--a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. YELLIN, keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold.",
    "457": "Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight. The Brutes, as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames. The Chapel, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on. Fezzik pulls off the holocaust cloak and rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is indeed closing quickly. Fezzik grabs the gate and swings the tonnage back upward. Yellin just watches in fear. Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head, and she's right. It's there. Yellin is pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik close in. He whips it out, hands it to Fezzik. Buttercup is standing there, dazed. Count Rugen and his Four Warriors are racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous. Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik are moving toward them. Actually, Fezzik is dragging Westley, who is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash--Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it. Count Rugen, as the confrontation is about to start. As his Warriors attack, Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warriors are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth Warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor. For a moment, he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs away. Inigo, momentarily surprised, then takes off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks. Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He tries again. Fezzik with Westley, who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls back. Inigo, desperately pounding at the heavy door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles. And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley. The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead. Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead. He's very surprised and pleased. Rugen is running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back. Inigo is behind him, coming like a streak. The intersection, with the large suit of armour, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley. Count Rugen, flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his pace.",
    "459": "Inigo pushes slowly off from the wall and attacks, slashing with wondrous skill, but none of his blows get through. Inigo moves forward as Count Rugen retreats more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder, thrusting home where the Count had gotten him, then strikes again, his blade entering the Count's right shoulder in the same spot where Inigo was wounded. The six-fingered sword strikes, leaving a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks, then flashes again, creating a parallel slash on Rugen's other cheek. Almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time, and Count Rugen cries out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center. The sword goes clear through the Count, and they are almost frozen like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and the Count pitches down, lying dead with ashen skin, blood still pouring from the parallel cuts on his cheeks, and eyes bulging wide, full of fear. Inigo stares at Rugen. Westley lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side. Buttercup is alongside the bed, her eyes never leaving his face. Humperdinck enters the room, staring at them, and pulls out his sword. Westley, lying there comfortably, grips his sword, watching. The look of fear that was in Westley's eyes at the wedding starts to return. Humperdinck does his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. Westley, lying there, stares at him, and now, slowly, begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand, and now he is standing, sword in fighting position. Prince Humperdinck, panicked, doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch, and throws his sword to the floor. Westley speaks to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits, and as she sets to work, Inigo enters, looking around. Humperdinck starts wrestling mightily with his bonds. They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and Fezzik is leading four great white horses. He glances up, sees them on the balcony, and as he holds out his great arms, Buttercup floats through the air, jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can catch her, but her fall is in slow motion so it might seem like she is flying.",
    "460": "Great waves of people kneeling. Buttercup, terribly moved, stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears. Hold on her beauty for a moment. Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse easily. Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in. Three men, standing close together in the path. Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his name is Vizzini. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel. Beside him is a giant. As she starts to fall. A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long. Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready. The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision. The horse takes off. They start for the boat. Vizzini hops onto the boat. Vizzini, in a fury. Inigo and Fezzik, as Vizzini advances on them. Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them. During this, Inigo has gone close to Fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received. As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes. Inigo is at the helm, Fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly--or do they? Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds. Inigo nods, glances back. Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess. Inigo keeps staring behind them. And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do. It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the wind whistles. And the waves pound. And suddenly it's all gone ominous. Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini squinting back, trying desperately to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths. Then-- The moon slips through and-- Inigo was right--something is very much there. A sailboat. It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap. Staring at the other boat. Buttercup, diving into the water, starting to swim away. The boat, and Vizzini screaming. Buttercup, still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water. Buttercup, treading water, still not far from the boat. Buttercup stays silent. Buttercup, and she's a gutsy girl. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past. She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- and the eel slithers closer, closer-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.",
    "463": "The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears gloves. Inigo stares at them. He glances up--the question clearly baffles him. He hands his sword to the Man In Black. Even now, this still brings pain. The Man In Black looks up at Inigo. And on that word, what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different. The six-fingered sword feinting here, feinting there. The two men, finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest. Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In Black retreating up a rocky incline. And he shifts his style now. The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin. Inigo stares down at him. And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent. The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more than that. And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being forced toward it. Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles. And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns. The Man In Black, stunned, doing everything he can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate. And the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again. A rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo--nothing can stop Inigo--and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.",
    "464": "Inigo fails in his attempts, and everything he tries is unsuccessful. He makes one or two final desperate moves, but they are ineffective. The Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six-fingered sword. He changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined. To his amazement, Inigo is being forced back down the steps. He tries different styles, but the Man In Black seems to be in control. Before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword. The Man In Black watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly. He copies Inigo, dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer, and dismounts with a backflip. Inigo stares in awe. The Man In Black dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle, and Inigo pitches forward unconscious. The Man In Black grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess. Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, sees far below the Man In Black running. Fezzik, carrying the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the morning. Vizzini points to them. There is a large boulder nearby. As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away, Fezzik grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder. The Man In Black, racing up the mountain trail, sees a bend in the trail ahead and slows. Then he stops, listening. Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend, a rock flies into frame, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him. He moves into the mountain path, picks up another rock, and holds it lightly. He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, and begins the approach toward the Giant. Fezzik flips the rock away. The Man In Black has never been a shrimp, but Fezzik towers over him so much. There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at Fezzik's chest, slams him with several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and makes any number of terrific wrestling moves. Fezzik just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery. Finally, the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant. They get set to begin again.",
    "466": "A knife is pointed at a throat, revealing Vizzini munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's throat. She is blindfolded. A picnic spread is laid out with a tablecloth, two goblets, a small leather wine container, some cheese, and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely spot high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea. The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, and slows. The two men study each other. The Man In Black nods and comes nearer. Vizzini jabs his long knife harder against Buttercup's unprotected throat, causing her to gasp against the pain. The Man In Black stops fast and nods again. As Vizzini fills the goblets with dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini. Vizzini studies the Man In Black now. As Vizzini's pleasure grows, the Man In Black's disappears. Suddenly, Vizzini stops and points at something behind the Man In Black. The Man In Black turns around, looking. Vizzini busily switches the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to laugh and picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment, then allows the Man In Black to drink first before swallowing his wine. There's nothing he can say; he just sits there. Vizzini watches him, laughs, roars, cackles, whoops, and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. The Man In Black steps past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead. The Man In Black pulls her to her feet and starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain. It's where Fezzik fought the Man in Black. The camera pulls back to reveal the Prince kneeling, inspecting every grain of misplaced sand. The others wait behind him. He leaps onto his horse and they charge off. The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her. The Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches but does not retreat. The picnic is spread as before. The camera pulls back to reveal the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up.",
    "467": "The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, sniffs it, and hands it to Rugen before vaulting onto his horse as they all charge off. Buttercup is spun into view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. They are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine, the drop sharp and severe. The ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be enjoyable. The Man In Black says nothing as Buttercup watches him closely. If she did not hate Roberts so much, she might have tears. Buttercup nods as the Man In Black is about to reply. Something catches his attention; a dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's horses rises into the sky. While the Man In Black's attention is on the dust cloud, Buttercup pushes him with all her strength. He teeters on the ravine edge for a moment, then begins to fall, rolling and spinning down toward the flat rock floor. Buttercup stares transfixed at what she has done. Without a second thought, she starts into the ravine, falling and spinning down toward the Man In Black. The dust cloud continues to rise as Prince Humperdinck and the others rein in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom. The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale. Two bodies lie a few feet apart, not moving. After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and crawls toward Buttercup, bruised and torn. They begin to kiss tenderly. Racing along the ravine floor, Westley glances up to see something perched on top of the cliff, looking down at them. Great trees block the sun as Buttercup panics, but Westley moves jauntily along, sword in hand. The giant trees look ominous, shielding all but intermittent stripes of sun. Westley forces Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, trying to suffocate the fire.",
    "470": "The room is lit by a few candles and appears dirty. Leopold's portrait on the wall looks down upon the disorder, with papers littering the table, dirty dishes piled in the fireplace, and Mozart's Masonic apron, woven with symbols, lying on the forte-piano. Mozart stands beside Constanze, who lies asleep. He looks very ill, and his wife appears worn out. He moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep, kneels, pulls up the child's blanket, and lays his head down beside the boy's for a moment. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart rises and returns, then starts to dance alone, gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait and makes a silly, rude gesture at it, briefly becoming an irresponsible and happy boy again. Suddenly, there is a gentle knocking at the door, and the music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens the door to find the masked stranger standing before him. He turns and looks as Constanze comes into the living room. Nervously, Mozart indicates her. Salieri contemplates them both, then turns and goes down the stairs. Mozart shuts the door and closes his eyes in fear, not looking at Constanze or replying. He looks at her suddenly, and her tears flow. He looks at her helplessly, and with a scream, Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute. On stage, the Queen of the Night, fantastically costumed, furiously urges her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged, shows an audience of ordinary German citizens standing in the pit area or sitting, rapt and excited. Some boxes have closed curtains, their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies. In one of them, Salieri struggles to loosen his cravat, moves to the door, and leaves the room. He goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, straight from the theatre, still in his bird make-up and feathered costume under his street cloak. He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute. Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet. Mozart looks at the coins astonished, takes his pen, and Salieri writes the key signature, humming the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting.",
    "475": "Constanze curtsies, causing him to giggle uncomfortably. Cavalieri glares at Mozart, who looks hastily away from her. She attempts to kiss the royal hand but faints instead. The Emperor contemplates her prone body, steps back a pace, nods pleasantly to all, and leaves the stage with his Chamberlain. Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches as Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber. She catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself, seating herself at her mirror and removing her wig. Salieri looks astonished as the door opens and Constanze enters. Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door, and Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. The old man speaks passionately to the priest as the young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross. Christ stares from the Cross. Leopold is seen kneeling not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Leopold, a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier, kisses the Archbishop's hand in deepest gratitude. The Archbishop motions Leopold to rise. The camera pulls back to see that Leopold is in fact kneeling beside Constanze. A priest faces them, behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others, including a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the Barroness. Out of breath, a Princess nods nervously. He smiles at Salieri, whose face falls almost imperceptibly. A servant enters, and Salieri goes into the salon. Constanze stands, closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts. Salieri enters the salon, and Constanze drops him a shy curtsey, then shyly unveils. He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table, indicating a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts, which he offers to her. She takes one and puts it in her mouth. He watches carefully, then takes one himself, revealing on his finger a heavy gold signet-ring. He smiles at her, and she takes another chestnut. The old man faces the Priest. The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting is shown. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them. His agonized and wondering face shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea, experiencing the point where beauty and great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.",
    "477": "Salieri sits at his desk, which is littered with manuscripts. In the middle of the room stands a billiard table. The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table. From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation. Mozart comes out. Framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid we noticed in Salieri's house. From his bedroom Leopold peeps out to watch. Mozart goes to the girl. Constanze follows. The old man emerges from his bedroom. Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl. Lorl goes outside and closes the door. Constanze turns on Leopold. A hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri. He hands her a pile of coins. She accepts them, delighted. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street. Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she shuts the door. She hurries off in the opposite direction. An outdoor concert is being given. Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly. A carriage clopping through the streets. Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood. Lorl is opening the door admitting Salieri. They go in. The door shuts. The room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity. She opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican. Salieri turns to look around him. She points across the room to the workroom. Salieri crosses and goes in alone.",
    "478": "Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus, moving slowly into the 'holy of holies,' picking up objects with great reverence—a billiard ball, a discarded wig, a sock, a buckle, then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather, then touches the inkstand and stealthily picks them up. The pages, then another page—the title page—written in Mozart's hand. Salieri stares amazed. They all sit, save Mozart. The room suddenly looks like a tribunal. All look at the Emperor. Then Joseph nods. Mozart falls on his knees and giggles. Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro. We watch Figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor, singing, and Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess' hat. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno are sitting with Salieri. The company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini-Rosenberg. Mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting. He rips out a page. Bonno watches in terror. He goes on tearing the pages determinedly. A servant opens the door to announce. He grabs Salieri. He kisses Salieri's hand. Mozart giggles with relief and gratitude. The Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg, and Bonno. The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence. Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre. Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot. We do look at them. Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat. Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach. CU, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks. He watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment. He bows too, giggling. Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is Salieri. We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten, all applauding. Then suddenly at CU, Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in Mozart's apartment. CU, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm. Salieri bows his head.",
    "482": "Mary opens the door and looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large tumbler and winks at her without pausing. Mary remains on the threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, talking as she goes. Later, Mary slams on the brake and tries to pull herself together. The Patrolman raps again, less gently. Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies her for a moment. Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in it, rummages for her wallet, but cannot find it. The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, and realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then the important papers envelope, filled with a couple of other items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, opens it, and hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at the car. The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks the license plate, and returns. He peers in, checks the car registration on the steering wheel, and returns Mary's wallet. She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment. She starts ahead, fast. As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror. The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind her at a matched speed. She glances out at her surroundings. The Freeway is ahead. She suddenly turns off the highway. She checks her mirror. The Patrolman is no longer following and has not turned off after her. She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, and makes a quick decision. Mary gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention to the line of cars, and notices the California license plates on all of them. The car dealer calls out from his office. Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot. She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a Los Angeles newspaper, and starts back into the car lot as she glances worriedly at the front page. As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same Patrolman. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, and stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in the newspaper and walking back into the lot, does not see the Patrolman.",
    "483": "The car dealer is out on the lot, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles. She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp, as she sees the Patrolman staring over at her, his face dispassionate. Mary has to force herself to look away. He starts into Mary's car. She stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning. As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses. Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. The Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase. He smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. As she drives out of the lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer and the Patrolman all looking after her. Mary is driving tensely. The camera is close on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears. She looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought. It is much later in the day, almost dusk. The view cuts to the road, from Mary's viewpoint. Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight, the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations begin to blaze on. Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices again. A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. The first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield. The oncoming headlights blurt at her. It is completely dark now, night. Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features. Big drops of rain begin to appear. She is becoming aware of the rain starting. The rain increases and is backlit by the oncoming headlights. Mary starts the windshield wipers. The wipers battle with the now torrential rain. Peering through the blurred windshield, she slows down in the flooding highway. The oncoming lights are fewer, just blackness and rain. An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield. She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road. The lights are on within the office. She tries the door, finds it open, goes into the office. Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell. She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees a path from the motel office leading directly up to this house. There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.",
    "49": "REGGIE shrinks back as he throws something into her lap. He continues to speak, punctuating each phrase with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else. As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her work, she notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks—but this time it is PETER. REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby. She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her. As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage, it is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. The elevator stops. He reaches across her and opens the door. She stops as she sees something. Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one. SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike. The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out. As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw. As PETER comes running up to her, he sees the metal hand. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in. Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free. He then rushes to the open window and climbs out. REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room. PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out. He then turns back. He climbs out. Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing.",
    "492": "Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly, its old stone and huge towers making it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors and slips inside. Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews. Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. He moves down the center aisle towards the back and finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other but stays rigid, hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. Malcolm nods at the information and smiles at Cole. His eyes drift down to Cole's arms, which are covered in tiny cuts and bruises. Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. Lynn walks over to Cole and checks his tie. She unclips the tie, and Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog is gone now. Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs. Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. Cole sits at the kitchen table, his hands pressed flat on the tabletop, looking shaken. Neither says anything for a beat. Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink, the pop tarts clearly visible. Lynn leans down, and Cole does too. He looks at her eyes. Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts. He walks back and takes them from her before leaving. Lynn glances to the kitchen table, her gaze stopping on the two tiny hand prints of sweat formed on the table's surface. Tommy Tammisimo, a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid, waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school uniform. Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps. The two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole. When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away. Cole starts to smile too, he thinks. Cole and Lynn smile at each other. Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen. The den doubles as a playroom, boxes of old toys sit in the corner, and a small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug. Cole appears in the doorway, and Malcolm sits up and smiles.",
    "496": "Tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter of a tent, which is a sanctuary made by an eight-year-old to hide in. Among them is the statue Cole stole from the church. Meanwhile, at a school play, some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals. Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey. At the private school, the arched halls are lined with posted drawings and test papers. Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall in silence, Malcolm taking his time. Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall and realizes Cole is no longer next to him. He turns to find Cole frozen about ten feet back and walks to him, noticing Cole's expression as he gets closer. Climbing ropes hang from the wood beamed ceiling. Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling, his body becoming very still. He looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes, glances at Cole, and turns back to find the child with tears in his eyes. Cole looks at Malcolm desperately while Malcolm stares helplessly. They see a black man in britches and no shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hanging in the center, a white woman in a torn white frilly dress with tears soaking her face, hanging to the right, and a small mixed race child in half pants, hanging to their left. The family stares at Cole. Later, Lynn fiddles with the dials of a beat-up twelve inch kitchen TV. Cole stands before it, and on the television screen is Tommy Tammisimo. He stands in his pajamas in a doorway, removes the gloves from his hand, and places them next to his plate, then moves them to the floor. Lynn is irritated, as this is a sore point between them. They eat quietly, Cole looking up with an anxious expression, then looking down at his lap. Lynn stares at Cole and folds her napkin quietly. Cole's eyes start to water up, and he stares at his mother's expression. He gets up, never taking his eyes off his mother, and leaves the room, entering the dark hallway. He gets startled by a sound, and Sebastian comes racing down the hall, scurrying past Cole. Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a couch. He slowly turns back and looks down the hall, seeing the door to his room sitting at the end of the corridor. Cole stops breathing, too terrified to move. Meanwhile, Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy out of the broom closet, fighting back some tears, and hugs him.",
    "499": "He stares statue-like at an abstract point in the room, then slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. Cole is very shaky, and Malcolm watches everything anxiously as Cole stares at Mr. Collins. The man's face begins to crumble as Cole holds out the jewelry box, which trembles with his hands. The father just stares at it, becoming very still, his eyes filled with a storm of confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands. Cole begins to back away, and the father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd. Cole reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house. The father looks down in a daze and goes to open the jewelry box, his movements slow and strained. He lifts the latch and opens the box, revealing an unlabeled video cassette. Mr. Collins is seated now, and her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance. The puppets go limp, the entire stage gets lifted up, and it is carried away by Kyra. The whole bedroom comes into view, with the camera seated on her desk in the corner. Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens. She carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich. The crowd watches in riveted silence, and the father never takes his eyes off of the screen. The image of the mother walks to a closet, pulling out a bottle of floor cleaner. She reads the label for the ingredients, walks back to the food tray, and unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner. The mother pours some into the cap. Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip, then slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another spoonful. The room is utterly silent. Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends and family. She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. It takes her a beat before she feels the stare and looks up. Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins, with a group of ashen faced guests standing in the distance behind him. Husband and wife's eyes meet, and Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears. The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes it in her small hands. The two children don't say anything for a while. Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has ceased, then looks across the two children on the swings. Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back.",
    "5": "The Colonel, deeply troubled, enters as the door swings open silently. He starts going through Ricky's bureau, opening the drawer where Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on the digicam and a stack of cassettes on a shelf. Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. The Colonel takes the cassette out of the digicam and inserts another, his face tightening as he watches the TV screen. He sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window. The camera is still connected to the TV. Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill. He looks up suddenly when he hears something, his face darkening, then smiling. He puts his spatula down. The Mercedes pulls around to the drive-thru window, Carolyn driving with Buddy sitting beside her. They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window. Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly. Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin, struggling to appear nonchalant. The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds, wind whipping garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar. Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead. Buddy looks at her unhappily, then sadly gets out of the car and shuts the door. She starts to cry, closing her eyes tight trying to stop the tears, then suddenly screams as loud as she can. We can still hear Carolyn's muffled screaming. The Colonel puts the weights down and looks at his reflection in the window, his arms are pumped. He reaches under the bench and grabs a cigar box, smiling. Opening it, he digs through marijuana paraphernalia, only to pull out an empty zip-loc bag. Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence. Ricky pulls his beeper off his belt and checks it, then heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy. It's raining outside. Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth. Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look. Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's garage window. Our view is blurred by the rain, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills.",
    "50": "PETER looks around from his balcony, which is the last one on one side, but there are two or three on the other. He climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony but is several inches short of touching it. He straightens up and prepares to jump. From the ground, PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony. He climbs over the railing of the second balcony and sees a light coming through the window and looks in. From the ground, PETER jumps to the next balcony and climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in and sees GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of a heated discussion. SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. There is a knock at the door. REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters, and she closes the door again. PETER is silent for a moment. REGGIE falls into his arms to be comforted. He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes. The phone rings, and REGGIE answers it. SCOBIE holds the receiver in his metal hand. REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face. He watches her. She shakes her head. He hangs up. Slowly, REGGIE lowers the phone from her ear and hangs it up. She hesitates a moment. PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels—and unravels—and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. REGGIE is on the phone with BARTHOLOMEW. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway.Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks. As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef, REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the table. BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.",
    "501": "The movie opens with a place called the SILVER BULLET. A sign outside flashes COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD. There is a huge gravel parking lot filled with pickup trucks and older cars. Even though it's early, the place is clearly a popular night spot and is already pretty crowded. The atmosphere inside is lively, with ten pool tables surrounded by crowds. The long bar is filled with customers, and there are tables and booths scattered around. The room is dense with smoke. A dance floor is present, but no one is dancing yet as the band is still setting up. There are a lot of single men in the crowd. Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise as they make their way to an empty table. A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table. As the Waitress leaves and later returns, she brings Louise's drink. Louise understands something, and Harlan laughs. Thelma laughs too but doesn't really get the joke. Harlan leaves, and Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey, signaling the Waitress to bring her another one. They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic problems until the Waitress comes over. Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at her, making dancing motions. She smiles and waves at him but becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise. Thelma speaks quickly, and Louise is used to it. Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the situation. Thelma drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass as the BAND strikes up a lively tune. Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass too. Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while. Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN. Thelma is breathless, drunk, and giggly, holding a beer bottle in one hand. She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan is studying her closely. Louise notices this and heads off to the bathroom, stumbling a step and dropping her beer bottle. There is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her. Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot. She is pretty limp. Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her head away. He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her, but Thelma pulls away. Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in. She scans the room looking for Thelma and goes over to the table, seeing Thelma's stuff there.",
    "506": "Thelma hops in quickly, and Louise careens back onto the road. Suddenly, Louise slams on the brakes and stops yelling for a moment, groping for self-control. Thelma looks pitiful as a T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route. Louise passes him, and as she does, he honks. They look up, and he is wildly pointing to his lap. Thelma is laughing wildly until she crosses the line from laughing to crying. They both get quiet, and Thelma leans back, watching Louise. She studies her as if she's never really seen her before. All of a sudden, a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face. She jerks upright and startles Louise. Louise knows what she is talking about and becomes immediately agitated, looking as if she is looking for a way to flee. Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems completely serene. The car is screaming down the road, and they drive through a little stand of buildings. A car speeds up to try and catch them, and the red and blue lights pop on. It is a New Mexico State Patrol car. Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror, and Thelma jumps awake. They are trying not to panic as the patrol car is right behind them. Louise pulls the car off the road, and the patrol car pulls up right behind them. The lights shine brightly in through the windows, and Louise does. The patrolman gets out of his car and approaches their car. He comes to the driver's side window. Louise smiles up at him and fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it, and shows her license. They walk to the back of the car, and he notes the license plate number. The patrolman gets in the driver's side, picks up a clipboard, and clips Louise's driver's license to it. He picks up the hand mike for the radio, and as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window. It's Thelma, and she puts the gun to his head. He drops it, and Louise reaches over and takes his gun. Louise shoots the car radio, and the cop flinches with each shot. Louise fires two shots into the police radio, blasting it all to hell. Louise reaches over and takes the keys, takes her license off the clipboard, gets out, and trots around to the back of the car. Thelma is holding the gun on the patrolman. Suddenly, Thelma fires the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover. Louise opens the trunk, and as he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise. They are in really beautiful country now. A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside.",
    "508": "At a Comic Book show, specifically at a book signing, Holden sits at a table with a large mock-up of the comic book cover featuring two stoner super-heroes resembling familiar drug dealers. He hands a book back to a barely-standing Fan, offering a patronizing half-smile. Across from them, Banky signs a book for a Collector but freezes up, then composes himself and continues. A Little Kid steps up, but the Collector lingers. Holden accepts another comic from a different Fan and looks to his left, freaking out as he sees Banky throttling the Collector. The Collector fights back, but Security Guards pull them apart and drag the Collector away. Holden grabs Banky just as Hooper, who comes off as a typical, pro-black/anti-white homeboy, fills the frame. During Hooper's speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front. Hooper looks for the source of a comment, then pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on Banky, and fires. Banky goes down, the crowd screams and scatters. Hooper jumps over the table, raising his fists. The crowd disappears, and Holden sits laughing. Hooper steps off the stage, picks up Banky's head, and sounds different, actually gay. Banky smiles as they turn to see Alyssa, a beautiful blonde angel. Holden hits Banky, who seethes and offers Holden a puzzled glance, then nods to Hooper. Holden, Banky, Alyssa, and Hooper sit around a table drinking, talking, and smoking. Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone. Alyssa laughs, Holden smiles. A dart hits the board, one hits the wall. Alyssa winds up with another dart as Holden watches. Through the window, a Couple makes out on the hood of a car. Alyssa exits, Holden stares after her. Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter with an 'Everything's Archie' comic. Banky runs out, Holden shrugs at Hooper. Holden answers it while still drawing. Hooper tends bar in a loud club with people mingling and a band playing. A Guy sips a drink. Holden enters and sees Alyssa dancing sexy like a cat in the middle of a thrall of people on the dance floor. Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare. Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit. Banky looks around.",
    "509": "People clap as the SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone and the crowd applauds. Holden looks at Alyssa, who shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her, but she shakes her head no, even as the crowd urges her. Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile as Holden pushes her forward. She shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd as they thunder and cheer. Banky and Hooper stand at the bar while Alyssa laughs and turns to the band, saying something which they nod to. She turns back to the crowd and Holden smiles as Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. Banky joins Holden, who glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile as Holden is smiling, being seduced. Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden stands a pretty GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there, and the song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied. She points to someone in the crowd, curling her finger back in a `c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her. She jumps off the stage as Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-shucks style. At that moment, the girl beside him leaps forward. Alyssa and the girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback. Banky's eyes widen and he allows a smile to creep across his face as the crowd applauds. Holden's eyes bug out and Banky looks around, noticing for the first time that this is a lesbian bar with a lot of chicks in this place. Holden continues to stare, mouth agape. Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back. Alyssa and the girl continue to kiss. Banky, Holden, Alyssa, and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table. Alyssa and the girl continue to make out while Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed. Banky stares a little harder and Holden hits him. Alyssa and the girl break their kiss. Kim exits and Alyssa looks at Holden. Banky is smiling ear-to-ear and Alyssa and Banky laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it. Then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck. Alyssa waves at Holden as he exits. Banky slides out of the booth and Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim. Holden looks preoccupied. The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked. Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing. JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.",
    "510": "Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face. The Execs and Sloss laugh, and Holden and Banky politely join in. Banky shoots Holden a `these guys are idiots' look, and Holden smiles. Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs. They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings. Alyssa holds up her hand, swallows what she's chewing and releases her tongue, which is just huge. Holden is transfixed. Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing. She exits, and Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa comes back in. Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage. Holden checks his beeper and exits. Banky starts packing his mags up. A little KID enters, staring at him, and he's gone. Banky stands there, open-mouthed. They head toward the skee-ball runs. Holden rolls the ball, and it pops into a twenty point circle. Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand. It pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs. Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head. He gets up and whips the ball in surprise. It ricochets off the ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine. Holden looks around, nervously. Alyssa laughs. Banky sits there, shocked. He puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table. Holden starts drawing. Banky stares at him and starts drawing something. Banky draws a four-way stop and finishes drawing. He illustrates according to his voice-over. Holden's shaking his head and storms away. Banky follows. Holden looks at Banky for a long beat. Banky stares at him, then suddenly softens a bit. He drops his head and looks into Holden's eyes. Holden stares back. Banky walks away. Holden watches him go and exits. Alyssa picks through her food. Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth. She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth. Holden watches her, then follows. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug. Alyssa offers the 'just wait' finger. The CASHIER turns to her. Holden stares at her and then stares ahead. He swerves the wheel to the right. The car pulls to the side of the road. Holden throws the car into park. The rain is a bit heavier now. Holden stares at Alyssa, and she stares back. Then she gets out of the car. Holden gets out of the car. It's raining pretty hard now. Alyssa's hitching up the road. Holden reaches her. She looks at him, rain drenching the pair. She shakes her head ruefully and walks away. Holden stands there, at a loss. Then he turns and heads back to his car.",
    "516": "She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. Elliot nods. Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the Edward Estlin Cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she bumps against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. Lee, shocked, is gasping. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book. Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving. The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. He picks up the phone and dials. The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. Frederick picks it up. When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner. Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes. She sighs. Lee looks at him. She sighs. She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning. He laughs. A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning. It's an overcast day. A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab.",
    "520": "Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area. She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick takes off his glasses, turns and looks at Lee in surprise. He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed. Lee sighs. Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest. Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled. Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter. Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs. Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway. Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away. He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee. He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen. Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the counter. He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow. Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room. Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway. Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch. Elliot jumps. The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft. She talks softly into the telephone. Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver. Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen. A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate. Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water. Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline.",
    "522": "Holly stays under the awning as Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her. People pass by as Mickey walks back and forth from the curb to Holly, growing angrier and angrier. A taxi pulls up to the curb. Mickey and Holly walk up to its rear door. He holds the door open for Holly. She gets in and slams the door. Mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and several evening-lit store windows. Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view. Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser. Elliot and Lee dance into view. Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee. She sips. Elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser. They embrace tightly, continuing to dance. Elliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table. Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works. The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves. Elliot looks listless and stares blankly at the table. The child takes the camera from Hannah, as well as picking up a second identical one from the table. The adopted children leave, the twins going off with them. When they're gone, Hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks at Elliot. She puts down her cup, still watching him. Hannah sighs. Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table. He stands up and begins to pace behind Hannah. He sits down again, in a chair next to Hannah; the ketchup bottle sits in front of him. The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face. He looks down. Hannah leans over and tenderly puts her hand on his shoulder. She touches his hand; Elliot embraces her. Elliot kisses Hannah again; they embrace tightly. She touches his hair. The screen shows a metal staircase next to a large white column. Holly's voice can be heard as she and Hannah make their way up the stairs, moving into view. A man carrying a shopping bag walks down the steps; he passes them. Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses. Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at it. She holds it to her. Hannah turns to Holly with surprise. She puts the jacket back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales. Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's side, while her sister stares at her, frowning. Hannah takes a blouse off the rack and looks at it.",
    "524": "Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily, then turns to Holly. Licking her fingers, she walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her, and only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre, then pops another one into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to a child sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly while others drink and eat, listening. As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway and walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe while Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other. Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink, and the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing. The camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands. The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey, with Holly behind her carrying a casserole. The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink. Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods. Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away and walks over to a nearby china cabinet. As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet and takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails, handing them to April. While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place. He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera, and Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen. The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee.",
    "526": "They disappear inside and the camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior as the sisters walk in. A waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room. She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. She takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag. The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area. She signals for the three sisters to follow her. The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus. They sit down. The hostess leaves. Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table. As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth. Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah, as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah. The camera is back on Lee. She looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation. She fidgets. She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face. She is equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks. She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset. The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building, to Elliot's analyst's office. The psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair. He holds a long, thin cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch. Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag. The camera follows the cigarette up to his face. Elliot looks thoughtful as the movie cuts to Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes. Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name. They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together. The film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office.",
    "527": "Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette and crushes it out in a nearby ashtray. Hare Krishna music plays over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and Central Park. A large group of Hare Krishnas dance on the lawn among other New Yorkers, their leader holding pamphlets and talking to someone through a chain-link fence. That someone is Mickey, wearing a short-sleeved shirt and holding a paper. Mickey walks away, flipping through the literature and then looking straight ahead, pondering. He puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen. A bench faces some wharf pilings, the water gently lapping against them as Lee walks into view, her hands in her pockets, standing alone and facing the water and the distant skyline across the bay. The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance, smoking a cigarette while talking on the phone to Hannah. People rush past Holly towards the subway, others walking up the station steps. Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette, looking off in the distance, smiling. Guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering and enjoying themselves, a lamp glowing on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan talks animatedly with a girl leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little boy, another guest takes a sip of wine as Evan turns and addresses the group. The guests laugh appreciatively, and a woman hands Evan some wine. He laughs, and the guests laugh with him, charmed. Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing various guests chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in private conversations, others listen and watch the offscreen Evan.",
    "533": "Lamps hang down from the ceiling as classical music plays in the background. Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area, where Frederick is seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen. Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment. Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs and kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area. Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks. She picks up a book from the stereo shelf and leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages. Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee with his hands in his pockets. The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area and sits down at the foot of the bed, starting to take off his shoes. Lee sits down next to Frederick, and he takes her hand. Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek, and they embrace. Frederick laughs, and their embrace gets tighter. Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking. As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey. The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen. As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses. The fast-tracking group turns the corner, and Gail pats Mickey's back, gesturing in exasperation. He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel. A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around. Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis. Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio. The writer reacts angrily. Gail tries to get Mickey's attention as they walk. Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer. He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor. Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room. Gail follows him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron. They share a drink in a paper cup.",
    "538": "Elliot stops walking to browse through some books, then turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle and looks at the book. He hands Lee the book. She thumbs through it as the movie continues. Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it. Elliot opens the rear door for Lee. She laughs as she gets in. As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark. Elliot turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads. The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts. Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to: The facade of Mount Sinai Hospital. A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam. First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-over Mickey sitting in a glass booth. He is wearing a set of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it. A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk. The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk.",
    "543": "Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase, examining the broken end carefully before throwing it against the wall where it shatters. Indy steps to the door and stands, listening, as Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag. Indy nods and Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the S.S. Officer. He then rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers, turns, and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. Henry looks shocked and horrified as Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead, leading him down the hallway in search of Elsa. He opens a door and enters, rushing back into the room where Elsa had been left, only to find a Nazi Colonel holding Elsa hostage. He looks at Elsa, then back to his father as everyone is yelling at once. Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's neck and she screams. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, shattering glass. Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy, propelling her directly into his arms. He holds her tightly but her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. She steps back next to Vogel and Indy is stunned. In a large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor, Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind their backs, accompanied by Vogel, Elsa, and two Nazi guards. Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace, where Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting. They only see a hand reach out. He looks at Henry with surprise as the man in the chair gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be Walter Donovan. Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary. Elsa rushes to Donovan's side, takes the Grail Diary from him, and takes a look for herself, then glances up at Indy. Meanwhile, Brody disembarks from the train along with the other passengers, a cross-section of Arabs and Tusks. A man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody as he continues through the crowd past various street vendors. A woman holds a chicken out to him but then walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd. Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody and they meet and hug, then begin to walk. Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a sinister man approaches, then puts the map back in his pocket.",
    "547": "Henry turns and grips the mounted machine gun with a perplexed expression, then pulls out his watch. Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time. Henry does and the exploding gun nearly shakes him out of his seat. Henry has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight, pulls back on the trigger, and the Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in his gun sight. Henry swings the gun around inadvertently. Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father. The plane begins to go down and Indy struggles to control its descent. The wheels of the plane touch down, and out of control, the plane skids and crashes first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond, sending a cloud of dust into the air. As Indy pulls himself from the cockpit, guns blaze. As bullets explode around them, Indy and Henry jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy. An old man kneels at his car repairing a rear tire, then turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the old man. Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. Henry is a very nervous passenger. Indy sees a low-flying Messerschmidt coming up behind him in the side mirror. As the Messerschmidt roars by overhead, bullets explode around them, narrowly missing the car. The car races toward a tunnel that cuts through a steep. The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns. The car enters the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time, slams into the mouth of the tunnel, shearing off its wings. The flaming fuselage continues to rocket through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. Sparks fly as its belly scrapes against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless ball of fire gaining on them, about to overtake them. The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and explodes in the middle of the road. As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow. Henry looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt screaming out of the sky toward them. The Messerschmidt drops its single under-fuselage bomb. It explodes in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. The car falls into the hole made by the bomb. Indy climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater, then turns back to Henry.",
    "549": "Elsa and Donovan take cover beside the parked car. Indy and Henry, followed by Sallah, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them. The BRETHREN are firing at the Donovan party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. The battle continues -- a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides. Crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. They look down at Kazim who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened. Kazim dies. Leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground. Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him. Now Brody tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head. They exchange a handshake. The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody. Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it. He slaps Henry again. Another slap. Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping him. Donovan appears at the turret cover. Indy and Sallah charge forward leading their horses and camels. Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase. Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver. Henry and Brody still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier. The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his seat. Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy. Indy and Vogel EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse. Indy pulls the trigger again -- his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. Now Indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. Hate-staring at Indy. Hate-staring back at Vogel. Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy. One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over Indy. Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.",
    "55": "**Evelyn's car pulls up before an elegant Spanish rest home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights. A small sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll sits on the rolling green lawns. Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her his arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance. Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees Evelyn first. She shakes her head. He then gets a clear look at Gittes, who is bruised and has torn trousers. Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question. She stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages to nod. Gittes locks eyes with Palmer. He points to the wall. After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes. Gittes strolls toward women knitting and working on a quilt. Two of the ladies giggle. The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her. He looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer. Gittes looks up and sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihill, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor. Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. Gittes watches her. Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring off into the night. Gittes turns. Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket on it. They drink. Gittes looks sharply at her. Then: She looks at him. They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near his eye. The view shifts again to include Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone. Gittes stares at her silently. She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes stares at it a moment.**",
    "553": "Indy, Sallah, Henry, and Brody creep forward to see a Temple carved directly into the rock with a spectacular Grecian facade. Giant columns define the Temple's perimeter. The Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple, walking slowly. Indy's group watches him from a safe distance. The Turk is about to approach a spot where a Turkish soldier lies dead, decapitated. The Turk stops one step away from the beheaded soldier, then takes one more step, which turns out to be fatal. Indy, Henry, Brody, and Sallah react to the sight, looking horrified. Two Nazi soldiers force another Turk forward, and everyone turns to discover Indy and his party surrounded by Nazi soldiers. Indy's group is relieved of their guns and brought forward by the Nazi soldiers. Indy laughs, then Donovan shifts his aim and shoots Henry. The bullet enters his side below the ribs, and Henry collapses, blood flowing from the wound. Brody and Sallah rush to his assistance. Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes, but Donovan points the gun at him. Two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of Indy. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. Elsa, Sallah, Brody, and Donovan show silent reaction shots, registering their different emotions as Indy proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary. Indy takes a few steps forward and stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. Indy looks at Henry and takes a step forward through the cobwebs. The cobwebs begin to move, and Indy instinctively rolls forward on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position, he sees what is causing all the trouble: a razor-sharp triple pendulum. Indy gets cautiously to his feet and sees the pendulum has been guarding a small corridor which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. Indy loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe. Brody and Sallah smile, relieved. Henry shakes his head, still lies in Sallah's arms, and lifts his head painfully. Holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, Indy's fedora is now covered in cobwebs. Indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter. Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away, and Indy falls up to his hip, his leg stuck through the hole where the stone once was. He grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the Grail Diary in his hand.",
    "554": "Indy carefully walks forward, examining each letter on the stones. Donovan and Elsa follow in his footsteps. Indy sighs with relief and steps forward, finding himself in a small opening, just wide enough for his shoulders to squeeze through. Beyond that, there is a 100-foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall. He sees nowhere to cross and looks again at the Grail Diary. Indy looks around and notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion. He calls to his son, then leaps into space. In midair, Indy looks around and down, and figures it out. The First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping. It's painted to blend in with the rocks below, a highly evolved camouflage in perfect alignment with everything seen below. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk. He crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple. A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine. Then he realizes that a man is praying at the altar with his back turned to Indy, dressed as a Grail Knight, but his face is not visible. When the Grail Knight sees Indy, he wearily gets to his feet and prepares to give combat, taking up his two-handed broadsword. He comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back, until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy approaches him and raises the visor, revealing that the Knight is a very ancient man. The Grail Knight reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing, then holds his sword out to Indy. At that moment, Donovan and Elsa appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups. Elsa and Indy exchange looks. Elsa chooses a cup—a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. Donovan instantly takes it from her, rushes to the well, and fills the goblet with water. Donovan drinks from the goblet. Then, Donovan's entire body starts to convulse.",
    "56": "She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe. Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. Then hurries out of the bedroom. Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two cars there. Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door. With the heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house. Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming in and out of view. Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him. Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She hurries on up the walkway to the front door. He brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's. Idles the engine with the lights off. Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house. He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch. Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house. Here the windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn. There's an inch or so of space at the bottom. Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone rises into shot, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes into view. Mulwray's girlfriend. Evelyn kneels. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish. Continues to watch. Gittes can see the servant again. In a moment he re-emerges back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it. She insists that the girl swallow down some pills. The girl reluctantly does. Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in. Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her. Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming. Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn jacket. He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face.",
    "562": "She gasps once again, terrified. Indy lifts her and carries Elsa as he moves forward. Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water. More rat-infested water as Elsa, now walking again, follows Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water. They move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. One coffin is elevated above the others. Together they begin to push on the lid -- STRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform. Lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. Indy and Elsa look in. Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield. The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield. Indy laughs. As it lights a match. Dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water. Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls. This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward Elsa and Indy -- SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach. The rats literally wash over them -- like a rodent tidal wave -- in their efforts to escape. Elsa SCREAMS. Indy braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water. They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. Indy literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath. Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and SPITTING. Now Indy pops up into the air pocket. He looks at Elsa -- they are both soaking wet. Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin. Indy swims, looking for an escape route. The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and screams in terror. Indy pops back up through the water. Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. The perfect picture postcard -- St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.",
    "568": "Edwards is shocked and pulls his own weapon, pointing it at Kay's head. He whirls around to see Jeebs' body growing another head in just four or five seconds. Kay raises the weapon again, threatening, and Jeebs nods, point taken. Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. Kay leaves, and the flash dims on Edwards and Kay sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant. Edwards takes the remaining chair. Zed continues addressing the recruits, who all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. Edwards's hand is up, then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand, and Zed calls on him. Edwards tries to stifle a laugh but can't. Zed looks into the gallery, where a frozen tableau of creatures includes a lunging, snarling beast with three bullet holes in its chest, a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head also having three holes in it, and in the back corner, an eight-year-old girl with a single bullet hole. Zed sighs, and there are sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed and Kay stand behind smoked glass, staring at the recruits in the shooting gallery. Zed turns and walks away, then reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. The recruits follow Zed out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. Edwards is the last one out of the room but stops as he steps into the hallway. Kay is outside the door waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other recruits herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket and holds it up in front of them. The recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. Alien shapes are visible within the neuralyzer. Dee and Zed are there, much younger, in a photograph showing a young Kay in a shirt and tie, holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of a landed flying saucer. Another picture shows the 1964 World's Fair grounds still under construction, with giant models of rockets marking the Fair's theme of space travel and two tall towers with flying saucers now mounted at the top of each. Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor just as long as the first.",
    "572": "The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty wails of frustration can be heard. Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against Edgar's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. He bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally cracks a hinge. Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty. He points up at the screen with a laser pencil. He indicates the three stars that make up the belt. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars will be out tonight. It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. Kay clicks off the picture of her. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen. Jay drags a chair and sits down. Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering light. Some lights are starting to go out. Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Kay and Jay walk away. Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun. There are several photos of a cat on the wall. There is also a pile of bejeweled cat collars. Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside, lumbering straight for the store, is Edgar. And then Jay fires, shattering the storefront window, and blowing up a car on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, slamming him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up. Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. Kay gestures to a group of onlookers, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere. After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. Zed is in his office. Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor. He looks up at the screen. Edgar gets out and walks away, fast, cursing under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the news vendor by the collar.",
    "573": "A voice answers Jay, but it's not the Vendor's. Jay looks down and realizes the voice is coming from the dog. Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to ensure no one hears. Kay grabs Frank, and the dog yelps. Passersby glare at Kay, who appears to be mistreating the dog. Jay tries to explain, but Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer. Kay shakes Frank once more, then lets go of Frank and turns to Jay, who is lost in thought. Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk. In the morgue, Laurel is working at a desk when Rosenberg's cat leaps onto it, landing in the middle of the file she's studying. Laurel jumps, then pets the cat and turns the name tag to face her. She notices something dangling from the cat's collar—a circular icon of a strange and beautiful metal with a center of hardened, translucent material, light green in color. She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement as if she's sucked into another universe. Her face goes blank as she sails through a massive starfield with millions of stars and billions of green planets racing by at the speed of light. From the corridor, a bell rings. Tony snaps the fly swatter down on a buzzing fly. Edgar winces. Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth as another fly goes down. Tony looks down to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter, seeing half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve. Edgar continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside. Laurel slams into a wall, thrown there by Edgar. He leans in, close and furious, grabbing her roughly and dragging her across the morgue toward the equipment she pointed to. As they draw close, Orion the cat bolts from underneath it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets, landing on top of a very tall one. Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice from the corridor outside. Jay looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't match what she's saying. Laurel rolls her eyes and looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.",
    "574": "Parrish blinks, unsure if he heard something. His grimace of pain fades as he releases his arm, the discomfort seeming to subside momentarily. It is unmistakably a Voice, not the wind. Parrish has heard something, but he looks around and no one is there. He can't finish peeing and turns back to his bedroom. Bewildered, Parrish looks around once more and climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. He pulls the covers up, not hearing a sound, and tries to close his eyes. Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still, no one is there. He seems fraught with indecision, unsure if he should get up or not, wondering what is happening. Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open. He glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep. Meanwhile, the great lawn is infested with workmen planting stakes, unrolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights. Ubiquitous is Allison, 35, Parrish's older daughter, with foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. A Painter approaches. Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observing the activity outside through the windows. Parrish grins, continues on, and is intercepted by Allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace. But Parrish only pours coffee, gazing at the goings-on outside which are increasing in intensity. Allison goes, and Susan observes Parrish fidgeting. The helicopter chops in overhead. A butler and May carry the overnight bags for the family as led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter. Drew kisses her, and over her shoulder, he glances at Parrish. Quince comes running up now. Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him as Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors. He smiles. The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take her eyes off him. He senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly. Susan laughs. The Young Man smiles. Susan looks into her coffee. Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited. Parrish disappears into his office. Drew, on his way out, glides past Jennifer's desk. Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the Manhattan skyline: cogitates.",
    "575": "Parrish takes a seat on the couch and opens a folder, suddenly flinching with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. It is sharp but brief, he notices it but since it does not continue, he ignores it. Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again. Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body. Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is possessed. Parrish gasps. He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen. Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the Young Man. The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out onto the street. Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable. Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice. His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful. Parrish is confounded. Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince. Parrish sits. Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic. The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it. Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself. As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa. Parrish is stunned. Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues. Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out. Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room. Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears the doorway to the library. The door is open. He hesitates before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see, now tentatively, he enters. Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight. Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before.",
    "576": "Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish, there is a shape. Something is there. Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the Voice muting him. He takes a step backwards. Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing. After a moment, the figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, revealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, offcenter, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful. A moment, Parrish beside himself. The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man daring Parrish to identify him. Parrish turns away. But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in front of him again. Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended. He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect. A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment. A SOUND at the door. Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa. Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits. Parrish is frozen, dumbfounded. Parrish is frightened by the response. Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer. As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the background. Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully surveyed. Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face for the first time. Parrish drifts into another awkward pause. The group waits patiently. Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe. Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips. Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned. Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his utensils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at his food. Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer. She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have obviously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air. At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.",
    "578": "Everyone sits when Parrish does, but Joe, feeling right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pastries, and heads for them. Immediately, indications of surprise appear on Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer'. Drew's reaction is guarded but intense. Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments. Joe interjects. After a moment, Drew regards Joe. The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish. Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members, but Joe doesn't move. Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door. Joe goes. Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on an examining table beside them. As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area. She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the corridor. Susan regards him. Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-thirties, Teena, an arm around her mother, Easter, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain. Easter looks up and sees Joe. She abruptly becomes still, eyes wide, as if sudden recognition. But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful. Joe looks at Easter, curiously. Joe regards Easter, a long moment. Joe shakes his head, a firm no. But when he looks and speaks to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret. She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile. He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off. Teena goes. Susan regards Joe, puzzled. Joe shifts. Another awkward silence. Susan smiles gently. Another moment. Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is staring at Parrish's food. Joe takes another big bite. Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories. Joe is riveted on Parrish now, Parrish aware of him, has paused. A knock, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish, then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway. Drew takes a moment, then plunges in. Drew is stunned. Drew heads for the door, turns around. Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace. Quince sees Parrish hesitate. An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears. An awkward pause. Allison elbows him. Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed. He sits, then immediately stands up again. Coyle heads for the kitchen. Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room. Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship.",
    "579": "Silence, Parrish is at a loss. Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks. Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's inquiries. Susan comes closer to Joe. Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by Susan. They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the stairs. He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the stairs, Susan watches him disappear. Susan is left alone now with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar. She kisses him. She goes. The Board of Parrish Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince. Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room. The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, surprised at seeing a convened Board, but still, he is all smiles. Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind. He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board. She bursts into tears all over again. A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return. The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away. Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, including Drew, Quince, and Sloane. Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew. A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer. Parrish is expressionless. Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew. Joe follows Parrish out of the room. Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe. The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the door closes, leaving Sloane behind. The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have lingered, exchanging post-mortems. An enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others. Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality. Quince is struck dumb. Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so. She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers. Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land. She smiles. Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss. The kiss lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door softly after her. He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.",
    "58": "Escobar steps between the two. Gittes takes a deep breath. A pipe yawns at the camera, with only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean. The view widens to include Escobar, Gittes, and two plainclothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk. A third assistant runs down the side of the cliff and over to Escobar. Escobar turns to Gittes and stares at him for a long moment, then stares hatefully at him. Gittes, in Mulwray's Buick, whips into the driveway. He rings the doorbell and, scarcely waiting for an answer, tries it. It's locked. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side, and starts to fool with the lock. The Maid opens the door abruptly and stares in some surprise at Gittes. Gittes pushes past her. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him, hurries to the door. She looks at him, searching his face. Gittes is looking around it. He continues to look around and sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. He goes to the phone and dials. Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket and unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them. Gittes gets up and shakes her. Evelyn is trembling. Gittes stares at her, charged with anger. He smiles and hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself. Gittes slaps her again, then again, hits her again, and belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters, and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. Kyo comes running down the stairs, turns after staring at Gittes for a moment, then goes back upstairs. Evelyn nods, then Gittes follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief. He picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, and is momentarily lost in them. Evelyn, with her arm around Katherine, talking in Spanish, hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment, she re-emerges. Gittes nods slowly, hangs up, and goes to the door. He opens it, and Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door. A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside. Escobar shakes his head. Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, and goes up the stairs.",
    "581": "He heads towards her, and they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd. Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer. They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding. He takes her in his arms and they dance away. On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe. His eyes are on Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops. Joe regards the Waiter for a moment. The Waiter hesitates. The Waiter moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM. On the dance floor, Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches. They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe waits. Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues. Parrish waits. Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him. In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky. Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. She hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. Now she stops again. It is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him. Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative. Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place. Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer. Susan holds herself very still. She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. A long silence, the words come out haltingly. Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other. Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light.",
    "582": "A plane takes off from Orlando International Airport amid heavy clouds. In a room, a digital clock on a bedside table reads 7:13, then turns to 7:14. A naked dark haired woman with her hair falling around her shoulders sits up on a bed, gets off, and a naked man sleeping on his stomach wakes up. She takes a purse and walks out of the room as the man picks up a cell phone, sits up, drinks from an almost empty beer bottle, and watches the woman reenter the room. She picks out some clothes, slips on a thong, while the man lights a cigarette. She lights a joint, climbs on the bed, straddles the man, puts the joint to his lips, then gets off the bed. He smokes a cigarette, sits up, snorts a line of cocaine, and walks out of the room dressed in a black suit and sporting dark glasses under a pilot's cap with an airplane pin on his lapel. People run across the tarmac as rain lashes the airport and lightning flashes in the distance. The man, now in a raincoat, walks under a parked south jet airplane, pauses near one of the wheels, opens his mouth and sprays some mouth freshener, trots to the mobile stairway leading to the passenger walkway and slips on the first step, joins the passengers through a side door, and sits next to his co-pilot, Ken. Whip inhales oxygen, fidgets on his side of the cockpit, brushes his hair, and pushes the side-stick forward. The cockpit shakes, and he takes the yoke and pulls back, ascending. The plane shakes, and items fall from overhead bins. Ken casts an uneasy sideways glance at Whip who, with eyes on the horizon, steers the plane through rough air, moves the side-stick forward, causing the altimeter to slide quickly to the right as the plane rises; they reach a clearing through clouds and bright sunlight as Whip levels out. A woman steps out of her room at Hotel Atlanta, carrying a folded-up massage table. She wears a dress and has a small tattoo on her shoulder. She pulls some bills from a bundle of cash, walks to a car, and places the massage table in the trunk. She smokes as she makes a call from the driver's seat, then leans on the steering wheel and lowers the phone to the passenger seat. A man snorts coke, looks Nicole over, drops his towel, and holds a small square. Margaret sits, facing Trina.",
    "587": "A cassette labeled Soul Funk number two plays on the stereo as Whip lies back with a pack of ice on his knee. He picks up a glass of whiskey as Nicole, fresh from taking a shower, exits the bathroom. She picks up a cushion, carries it to Whip, kneels down beside him, and removes the ice pack from his knee. She lifts his leg and places the cushion under it, then massages his knee. Whip is laid back in the armchair watching as Nicole's hands move up to cover his hand. He raises the glass as if to take a drink but stops midway. Nicole hesitates, her gaze steady on him, then takes the glass from his hand and sets it carefully on the nearby table. She pushes herself towards him and they kiss. They look into each other's eyes and their lips meet again. The next morning Whip watches Nicole as she briefly stirs in her sleep. Whip looks up and rises off the bed. Outside, Hugh gets out of a car. Whip steps onto the veranda holding his cane and a gun. Hugh partially raises his hands. Hugh and Whip climb a platform near the church. A small congregation listens to a sermon in a cordoned off area. Hugh takes a pair of binoculars and watches a woman step out of a black SUV. Whip watches as reporters and officials wander around the wreckage. Whip clenches his jaw. Carr stands at the far end of the large conference table opposite Charlie. Carr pushes through the double glass doors and walks towards Whip, who stands. Whip forces a smile. Whip drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. He watches a home video of his father and son playing football. Nicole walks in the door. Nicole watches him. He increases the volume on the TV. Nicole has not moved since she walked in. She watches Whip try to stand, and then, fall. He lies prone on the carpet. Nicole covers her mouth with her hand. Whip has passed out. Nicole removes the cigarette from his fingers and adjusts his head so he can breathe easily. Nicole covers Whip with a blanket, then turns off the video and switches off the light. Nicole sits in a chair on the veranda taking pictures. Whip steps out in a bathrobe, ambles toward her, and sits in a rocking chair. He smiles at her, places a cigarette in his mouth and picks up her camera. He picks up a book from the coffee table between them, points to some open land. Nicole puffs on her cigarette and nods. Whip points the camera at her. At a church, a large framed picture of Katerina stands surrounded by flowers as a coffin is carried out.",
    "589": "Whip reads the letter using the light from a nearby window, then picks up the bottle and throws it hard across the room. It explodes against the hanging photo of his son, which stares at it motionless. Rain falls steadily as Whip sits in the car and pours alcohol into a bottle of juice and takes a drink. He exits the car and enters a large hangar, where the crashed South Jet Aircraft stands almost completely assembled with parts strewn around beside it. Cabinets and shelves line one side of the building. Whip cocks his head as Hugh follows Charlie out of the plane, then Hugh turns and walks away. Whip speeds down the mud road, splashing slush to the side, but brakes when he sees news crews outside the farmhouse. Some reporters spot him, so he reverses and drives back onto the main road, stopping opposite a house in a quiet neighborhood and pulling up on a curb barely missing a fire hydrant. He chugs on the bottle of juice, steps out of the car, and walks up a footpath to a house. A man watches Whip from a parked car and speaks into his cell phone as Whip's ex-wife opens the door, her smile fading. Whip hugs the struggling Will, turns off the news, and lifts his arms. Later, Whip walks down a hotel corridor with Charlie holding a can of Coca-cola. They approach a burly man and Hugh emerges from a room. Whip enters the room, and they shake hands and hug. Whip looks around the spacious room, picks up a can of Coke, and goes over to the fridge, finding it stocked with juices and nonalcoholic beverages. Later, he eats a meal alone in his room, lies in bed surfing channels on the TV, and shaves. He tries to open the thick file Hugh left for him, and it spreads like an accordion, so he abandons it. He sits over the toilet smoking as the bath fills. The clock shows 2:08 AM as he hangs a suit in a wardrobe. He looks around for the source of the knocking and is later awakened by the same sound. He gets out of bed, goes to a side door, holds his ear to it, then pulls it open. The extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room bumps repeatedly against the doorjamb. Whip enters the room, where a gentle breeze blows through the balcony doors ruffling drawn curtains. He walks over and gazes at the skyline, seeing a plane's beacon lights flash in the night sky. Turning around, his eyes fall on a fridge. He opens the door to reveal rows of miniature bottles of alcohol on the shelves.",
    "591": "Lightning flashes behind as it moves forward. A human eye is seen, then Harry Potter's bloodied face. A host of press photographers flash their cameras repeatedly at the dazed looking Harry and a tall, white-haired old man with a long white beard, Professor Dumbledore. Dumbledore puts his left arm protectively around Harry's shoulder, and steers him through the crowd. Dumbledore wears two rings on his left hand. Reflected in the glass of a tall office building, the brooding storm clouds settle over the City of London. The staff on one of the upper floors gather at the windows, and look out in alarm, as the menacing clouds drift ever closer. Lightning flashes behind the clouds. They billow forward in the shape of a skull, from which three dark trails of smoke appear. They swoop through the clouds, down towards the Thames, then across Trafalgar Square. They sweep up Charing Cross Road, moving swiftly past Leicester Square tube station. Traveling down narrow alleys, back streets, and through solid walls, they hurtle into Diagon Alley, where they swoop into a shop. It bursts into flames. People lie injured, as the Death Eaters emerge from the shop, one holding a man with a bag over his head. Two wear metal masks. The third has a long, thin face and a beard. They zoom away, and weave over and under the Millennium Bridge. It tilts and sways, flinging people against the parapets. They cling on, desperately. Steel supports are ripped away. Those on the undulating bridge run in panic. The remaining supports give way, and the bridge crashes into the murky waters of the Thames. The three trails of smoke rise from the river, and cross each other in a blur. At Surbiton Railway Station, a pretty waitress is seen. He puts down the paper. She smiles at him, starts to walk away. He spins round. Harry smiles at the waitress. As she goes, he cups his hand over his mouth. He sniffs his breath, then pops a mint in his mouth. A train flashes through the station. Harry slowly rises and walks to a window. A light flickers on the platform opposite. He uses his sleeve to wipe condensation from the glass. Another train passes. Harry's eyes are fixed on the opposite platform. As the train disappears, he sees Professor Dumbledore standing in front of a billboard advertising Divine Magic Perfume. Harry smiles and crosses over to join him. Dumbledore stares at the Divine Magic billboard. Dumbledore has a blackened hand. Harry sees the waitress leave the cafe. Harry holds Dumbledore's left arm. Harry's face contorts as they spin. They're on a street. Dumbledore walks past a market cross. Harry follows him down the dark street. They stop outside a detached house.",
    "592": "A tall figure with a thin face and beard stops and smiles menacingly. Harry appears behind Ginny and raises his wand, but Greyback deflects the spell and flies up in a spiral of black smoke. Ginny and Harry turn in circles, seeing no sign of him, and take refuge on a small island of sand. Bellatrix spots them while Remus and Tonks are still searching. On their tiny island, Ginny and Harry fend off attacks with their wands. Tonks, Remus, and Mr. Weasley join them on the island, and they form a circle, back-to-back, wands poised. Bellatrix watches them, and Greyback glances at her. They change form, shoot into the sky as a cloud of black spell, and attack the Weasley house, which bursts into flames. Mr. Weasley sprints off and finds his family safe, watching their house burn. He puts an arm around his wife, and the others join them. They all watch helplessly as the Weasley house is engulfed in flames. Lavender puts a heart pendant around Ron's neck, and Hermione watches Lavender simpering over him. She heads back the way they came, and Harry nods to Ron, then walks along the corridor. Lavender leaps on Ron's back, and he staggers away with her. Harry plunges his face into the pensive in Professor Dumbledore's cabinet of vials. He sees teenage Tom Riddle at a Slughorn tea party, and Slughorn smiles uneasily. Tom taps the hourglass, and the memory stops. Harry straightens up, and Dumbledore dips his hand into the pensive. Harry stands solemnly in front of Dumbledore and nods. The Potions class leaves, and Slughorn turns and sees Harry. Slughorn shifts uneasily and, on his way out, stops, spins round, and stares at Harry, who doesn't flinch. He stomps out, closes the spyhole, and locks the door. Harry finds Ron in the boy's dormitory, sitting on the floor, gazing dreamily out of the window, holding a gift box. Harry moves away as Ron leans closer, then throws down the box, which has a heart on it. Harry stares at Ron, who smiles inanely with a far away look in his eyes. As Ron sits on the floor and gazes up at the moon, Harry reads the card which came with the chocolates. He grins and crosses to Ron. Little hearts float from it, and Ron embraces Slughorn. Harry prises him off, and Ron sits on the back of the sofa and falls off. Slughorn gives him a potion, and Ron drinks. The inane, fixed smile fades, and he looks quizzically up at Harry. He fills three glasses, and Ron drinks and collapses, foaming at the mouth. Harry runs to Slughorn's potion cabinet as Ron convulses on the floor. He puts one in Ron's mouth and leans over Ron, who lies on his back, no longer breathing.",
    "598": "Dumbledore glances down and catches Harry's eye. Snape looks eyes with Dumbledore, Bellatrix glares. Dumbledore's eyes flicker. Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore is flung backwards over the balustrade. The white-haired professor seems to float gently downwards. Snape grabs the distraught Draco. Bellatrix is jubilant. The shape of a skull appears in the dark clouds. Snape rushes Draco down the tower's spiral staircase. Harry follows, as Snape leads the death eaters and the ashen-faced Draco through the school corridors. Bellatrix creates havoc as she strides along a table top in the Great Hall. An Auror is thrown aside. Bellatrix aims her wand at the huge windows. They explode and the candles are snuffed out. Draco, Snape, and the Death Eaters stride through the forest towards Hagrid's cottage. Harry follows. Bellatrix sets fire to the cottage. Harry aims his wand. Harry falls. Bellatrix licks her lips then saunters away. Illuminated by the flames from the burning cottage, Snape stands alone. Harry lies on his back on the hillside. Snape turns away as Harry gets to his feet. Harry staggers forward. Snape deflects the spell. Harry crashes to the ground. Snape walks over to him. Trembling, Harry looks up at Snape, who kicks Harry's wand from his hand. Harry lies motionless on the grassy hillside. Snape hurries away past the burning cottage below him. Harry looks up at the glowering clouds forming the shape of a skull. Harry strides through the school courtyard followed by Hagrid. He pushes past students and teachers. Professor McGonagall, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron stand at the front of the crowd. Harry kneels beside Dumbledore's body. He leans forward and gently touches Dumbledore's cheek. The Horcrux. Harry gently places his hand on Dumbledore's heart. Ginny walks forward and kneels down beside Harry. He rests his head on her shoulder. A tear rolls down Hermione's cheek. Professor McGonagall raises her wand high above her head. The tip of it glows as it points up towards the skull- shaped cloud. Pomfrey raises her wand then Luna. One after another, everyone does the same. Wand after wand points upwards, the tip of each one glowing like a star. Grief-stricken, the staff and students stand in solemn silence. Dumbledore lies before them, his face serene and peaceful. As the wands glow more brightly, light bursts through the clouds and the skull disappears. Harry takes his hand from Dumbledore's heart. His head on Ginny's shoulder, Harry weeps. Sunlight streams in through the damaged window of the Great Hall. The long tables are bare, the seats and benches are empty. The door of Dumbledore's study opens and Harry steps inside. It, too, is bathed in sunlight. Harry walks towards Dumbledore's desk. A pair of half-moon spectacles lies on an open book.",
    "600": "Bellatrix sets down the ornament and glares at Snape. Narcissa glances at her sister, then looks anxiously back to Snape and stands. They both stare at Bellatrix as she steps towards Snape, positioning herself behind him before walking away, staring open-mouthed. Narcissa and Snape grasp each other's right wrist. Bellatrix waves her wand, and a glowing cord binds their wrists together. Narcissa stares unwaveringly at Snape as Bellatrix stands close to him. The cord binding their wrists fades and disappears. Narcissa releases her grip and flexes her wrist. At a shop called Pieces of Modern Magic, outside, a mechanical man makes the rabbit on his head disappear under a big top hat. The Weasley twins are there, and a boy looks sick. Ron watches a mechanical toy of Dolores Umbridge balancing on a tightrope. A boy walks up a wall. Harry spots a strange substance, and the twins give him some. A handsome youth, Cormac, smiles at Hermione. She puts down the love potion. Ron turns to Hermione and Harry. They pass Lavender, a girl with curly hair. Lavender watches him go. Outside, a little dragon breathes flames, roasting chestnuts. A boy buys some and slides down a chute into a bag. They're in Diagon Alley and enter the empty and burned out shop the Death Eaters attacked. Harry leads the way, followed by Ron, then Hermione. Ron stops by a window and looks out. Narcissa and Draco look around furtively before entering a narrow alley. The trio leave Ollivander's and peek round the corner, where there's a wanted poster for Fenrir Greyback: The beardy Death-eater who attacked the shop. They follow the Malfoys down the gloomy alleyway. The Malfoys descend steps to a shop with a sign above its door, Borgin and Burke. Narcissa strides in, and Draco follows. The three friends look up as a light comes on in an arched window in the roof at the rear of the shop. They climb onto an adjoining roof and watch as the Malfoys are led across a courtyard below into a high room. It reaches from the ground floor to the roof. They see Draco running his hands over a tall, triangular, embossed wooden cabinet. Several figures approach Draco. Harry hauls himself up to get a better view and Narcissa kisses her son's cheek. Someone appears at a window. Harry, Hermione, and Ron duck down as a thin-faced man with a beard looks out. He lowers the blind. Harry looks up and breathes a sigh of relief. The Hogwarts Express chugs through barren moorland. Luna holds magazines. Ginny has a Pygmy Puff. Ginny reads the cover. Luna saunters along the corridor with her magazines. Further back on the train, Hermione, Harry, and Ron have a compartment to themselves.",
    "606": "He closes the cabinet again, then opens the door a third time. The apple has returned with a large bite taken out. At the party, Harry has his photograph taken with Slughorn. Harry turns and spots Neville walking away wearing a waiter's jacket, then sees Hermione slipping into a curtain. He pulls back the silk drapes to join her, but she scuttles away as Cormac comes through the drapes. Snape opens the curtains and Cormac throws up at his feet. Snape glares at him and walks away. Filch manhandles Draco into the room, and Draco glares at Snape. In a dark corridor, Snape has Draco pinned against a wall, and Harry overhears them from an adjoining corridor. The Hogwarts Express plows through snow-covered countryside. She breathes on the glass, then draws with her finger the shape of a heart with an arrow through it. She looks lovingly at Ron, whose expression glazes over. She breathes on her love heart, then whispers through the closed door. Ron looks up as Hermione comes to the door. She sees the love heart, and Ron looks confused. They both look up at the fading love heart. Christmas is at the Weasleys'. Nymphadora Tonks indicates to Harry to remain quiet. Tonks walks away and Remus Lupin follows her, leaving Harry with Mr. Weasley. Ginny sits beside Harry with a plate of dainty mince pies. Mr. Weasley goes, and she holds out a pie. He takes a bite from the pie she's holding. Ron plunks down between them with a plate of bigger mince pies. Looking awkward, he turns to Harry and holds out the plate. Ron takes one and bites into it. Harry's with Mr. Weasley in his shed. Harry looks at him thoughtfully. Later, the front door of the house opens. Remus walks out, followed by Tonks. Remus looks out into the night. Tonks steps forward with a concerned expression. Wearing a pink dressing gown, Ginny finds Harry sitting on the stairs. He stands up. She bends down and fastens the lace on his trainer. Ginny rises. They stand close to each other. They lean closer. A ball of fire hurtles to the ground, creating a flaming circle around the house. In a swirl of black, Bellatrix appears. Harry races out of the house. She laughs and sprints away. Harry dashes through a gap in the flames. It closes, preventing Remus from giving chase. Tonks tries to control the flames with her wand. Ginny runs out and leaps through the flames. Harry chases Bellatrix through the tall reeds. Ginny follows. Harry stands still, surrounded by the swaying reeds. Hearing something, he starts to run again. Ginny is a little way behind. She ploughs through the undergrowth, ending up ankle-deep in water. She hears movement and steps back as a figure emerges from the reeds.",
    "608": "Notes on Alison's novel are seen. Ingrid slinks out in her bra and knickers, then pads off after Alison waves. Alison looks him in the eye while seated in a restaurant, where Sydney's mouth hangs open. A snow dusted black limousine draws up and a man opens the car door for Sophie. She climbs out onto the street, pink dressed and a light pashmina, posing for press photographers before leaving Sydney alone with Elena. Sydney boogies on the dance floor, happy bounces around joyfully as a smiling Sydney jives. Smiling suggestively she wraps her arms around Sydney. Images from a moving car show tall palm trees and signs read Hollywood, Beverly Hills. The limo sweeps down a main road where a billboard sports an image of a pouting Sophie wearing a nun's habit. Stripped to his socks and boxer shorts, a terrified Sydney tries to gather the courage to leap between two high hotel balconies but hops back down from the railing. The hotel room's filled with the young, affluent and beautiful. Sophie unzips her blue dress and lets it fall to the floor, handing Sydney her bottle of beer as she strides out onto the balcony in her bra and knickers. The guests rush over to the adjacent balcony to watch. Smiling victoriously, Sophie stalks into the room from the adjacent balcony. Reluctantly, he wrinkles his nose and snorts like a pig, hopping from one foot to another, his limp wrists held up to his chest. Drinking whiskey at the foot of his bed and half watching a monster movie on TV, he flicks through the channels. It's his mum. He drops the remote control and looks down at his bare hand. The handsome Brill-creamed gent in the '50s movie slides an engagement ring onto Sydney's mum's finger and she gazes love-struck into his eyes. Sydney's transfixed. A sleek black sedan by a fountain outside the 53rd Annual Apollo Awards sees Sophie, Elena and Sydney get out and head down the red carpet towards the entrance. Sophie wears gold an ostentatious white fur stole and a long flowing red dress. Inside she does an interview for the cameras while Sydney stands waiting nearby. Lawrence approaches and Sydney's eyes rove in thought as the penny drops. He sits beside Sophie in the award ceremony where the woman onstage announces the winner, Sophie Maes. He looks up from his seat to see that Sophie's wearing his mother's ring then lowers his eyes. The crowd applauds and Sophie makes for the stage. He runs up behind her then Sophie charges, pins him on the table and they fall to the floor. She slaps him. Richard watches on the hotel room TV and the magazine models see Sophie kick Sydney. Alison chuckles to herself as she watches the debacle.",
    "609": "Sydney floors Sophie and springs up to his feet. Elena is being restrained. He runs off as bouncers approach. Sydney stomps Vincent's dark glasses underfoot, causing Vincent to shield his eyes from the light. Sydney races out of the doorway and then outside, where his escape is blocked by fans and photographers amassed behind a red rope cordon. Sydney looks defeated, but then a young guy lifts the cordon, and the bespectacled mop-head guy nods for Sydney to pass, allowing him to race off through the crowd. He approaches a pretty flame-haired flight desk attendant at LAX airport, glaring at his mobile before looking up to see himself on a TV mounted to a pillar nearby. Onscreen, Sophie dives on Sydney, pinning him to a table, and a close-up shows them grappling on the floor. He smiles blankly at her, then obliges. Looking bedraggled in his ruffled mess of a suit, Sydney sits alone in the departure lounge, impatiently tapping his hand with his mobile phone. A burly guy in a yellow baseball cap, grey jacket, and jeans pushes a floor buffer past behind him. Sydney looks at the gold ring in his palm, spiraling his hand around it, and stares off. A yellow taxi drives through the streets with Sydney seated in the back. He looks out through the window to see La Dolce Vita open-air cinema screening, with people seated in deck chairs and on blankets, staring up. Sydney searches for Alison in the crowd. On the screen, a man rides on a woman's back. He staggers around, looking left and right, then stops to stare up a grassy incline. His face lights up as he sees Alison, reclining on a blanket, beside a man and a woman. Alison leans in and talks to the man with an air of familiarity. Sydney's face drops, and his shoulders sink, but when the other woman hugs the man and they cozy up together, Sydney's smile returns, and he hurries up the slope towards them. Alison squints up at him, smiles, and he looks around awkwardly. She picks up her notebook and hands it to him, looking on as he leafs through it. They smile at each other. He tosses the book down on the blanket and offers a hand. She takes it and rises to her feet. They stand hand in hand, facing each other, just inches apart. She smiles, and they share a passionate kiss. They kiss, and he secretly takes the ring from his trouser pocket and puts it in the pocket of her floaty, pale blue floral dress. They share a look then turn to face the screen.",
    "612": "Steam leaks off the window as doe-eyed Sidney stares open mouthed at the passing illuminations. The glowing peaks of skyscrapers gleam in the night sky. White flowers float on the surface of the rooftop swimming pool as immaculately dressed glitterati mingle and sip champagne. Sidney saunters over to Alison carrying a plate piled high with finger foods. Three beautiful women slink by. Lawrence walks off into the crowd. Party guests whip out their mobile phones in response to the ring tone. A glamorous woman in her 50s approaches heavy featured, debonair Lawrence. Lawrence drifts off with goateed Vincent. Sidney approaches Rachel who stands by herself looking out over the city. She looks at him suspiciously. Beaming she puts down her champagne. Sidney hands her a napkin and a pen. She hands him her autograph. Sidney grins. He rejoins the others. Eleanor gestures to a besuited young man on the opposite side of the pool. He dutifully taps Sophie on the shoulder and she turns to face Eleanor. Sophie is resplendent in a backless white halter neck dress. Sidney's jaw drops. Eleanor waits for her to join them. Pulling up the poolside, Sophie looks around for an appropriate route but is hemmed in by guests absorbed in conversation. Smiling, she scratches her head, then kicks off her glittering high heels before stepping fully clothed into the pool. Photographers take pictures as she lifts her sleek, jet black hair over her head and wades gracefully towards Eleanor. Clutching her long hair in a bun, she smiles flirtatiously for the camera. She pulls herself up out of the water, her wet dress clinging to the sinuous curves of her lean, shapely body. Eleanor speaks on her cell phone as they leave. Sophie and Eleanor lead the way outside where a bustling crowd of press photographers asking for Sophie's attention. Sidney shields his eyes from the glare of the flashing cameras puts a coat over Sophie's shoulders. And they head towards a waiting car. Sidney tries to squeeze into the car beside Sophie. Her Chihuahua. They walk together. Sidney stops with a frown as Alison strides off. Sidney sits at his computer. Lawrence throws him a newspaper. A woman delivers a basket of flowers to Lawrence. He reads the gift tag. Gray-haired Lawrence gives Sidney a prickly look, then walks away. Alison looks at a tight-lipped Sidney and shrugs. He turns back to his computer. Sidney zips up his fly as he rounds a corner into a white-walled corridor. He sees Elizabeth Maddox approaching and stops anxiously in his tracks. She stumbles and falls down in a heap in front of him. Alison watches with baited breath from the end of the corridor. Slack-jawed, Sidney gawks at her and she raises her eyebrows.",
    "614": "Sidney scurries off excitedly and, back at his apartment, types on a laptop at his coffee table. Grinning proudly, he scratches his chin and looks down at a pile of magazines on the table. He takes some of Sophie's promotional literature from the pile and regards it with a grimace. It's Chihuahua, Sophie stares back at him from the page. He dials a number on his cell phone. A van sweeps past the Soho Grand Hotel. Sidney fidgets as he tries to get comfortable on a sofa in the spacious white lobby. The cushion he's sitting on slips forward and he sinks awkwardly into the crack. A tall, slender woman emerges from a lift to find him struggling with the cushion. His shirt and tank top have ridden up unflatteringly. The woman towers over him. Sidney's eyes widen. She shrugs. Sidney plonks the fishbowl down on the bar. She stifles a self-conscious smile. On a TV, Alison's eyes are downcast. He comes back for the fishbowl. He heads off. Alison stares down sadly at an untouched glass of White Russian. Clayton presides over a staff meeting. Sidney's irked. Sidney scowls as Lawrence basks in the adulation of his colleagues. Sidney catches up with him outside the meeting. He grins broadly then heads off before turning back heavy-browed. Sidney screws up his face. Lawrence gives him a jaunty nod and saunters off. Lawrence takes a seat behind his desk to address his underlings. A blonde strips and dances. The stripper reveals a penis. Mrs. Harding and her two young daughters looking. Sidney quickly cups Bobbie's dangling penis. A stone-faced receptionist stares at Sidney, who sits outside Clayton's office obsessively scrubbing his hand with a tissue. The receptionist frowns. Sidney looks in at Eleanor and Clayton, who stand at a desk discussing an A3 mock-up of a potential magazine cover. Eleanor exits and walks uneasily past Sidney. Clayton looms large in the doorway. Sidney skulks into the office with his head hung low. He sits as Clayton paces. He's behind Sidney. He walks round to face him. Sidney looks him in the eye. Clayton stares coldly. Clayton turns away in his high-backed swivel chair as Sidney lopes out with his tail between his legs. Seated party guests eat under white marquees on the lawn outside Clayton's sprawling mansion. Alison's puzzled. Sidney rises from the table and lets his hand linger on Alison's shoulder before sauntering away. Alison looks behind her, then she too rises from the table. Sidney, dressed in long shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, spots Sophie approach Lawrence. Sidney joins Lawrence and Sophie. Sidney gawks. Sidney lopes off. Sydney spies on them from behind a bush. Lawrence stands with Alison, playfully tossing nuts into his mouth.",
    "618": "A low-rise bungalow perched on a gentle slope looked out over an uneven lawn under a cloudy sky. A teenage girl with short brown hair tied back in a small ponytail swigged from a small plastic bottle as she contemplated an armchair standing on the lawn in front of her. In flashback, the girl stepped out of her knickers and walked slowly across the room towards a skinny boy sitting bare-chested in the same armchair. Wearing just a T-shirt, the girl gave a tentative smile as she straddled the boy's lap and brought her rosebud lipped mouth close to his. She stopped the boy's mouth with a tender kiss. A shaggy blond dog did what he was told. The girl took a swig of juice and wiped her mouth on the sleeve of her hoodie. She picked up a pregnancy kit and reached for the washroom key. He handed her the key. In the washroom, she unzipped her jeans and sitting down on the lavatory seat, she opened the pregnancy detection kit and brought out a narrow paddle shaped stick and put it into position. She pulled the stick out and gave it a cursory look. Then, she hurried back through to the store towards the counter. She slapped a pack of sweets onto the counter and gazed at the test. She shook it and rolled her eyes at the counter clerk and left the store, stick in one hand. Her expression was suddenly forlorn. Juno slung the rope candy onto the branch of a tree and made a noose. She bit into the liquorice rope and wandered off home. In her bedroom, the light switch doubled as a doll's penis and naked dolls were clustered on the mantelpiece. There was a photo of Bleeker playing his guitar. Juno dialed a number on her hamburger-shaped phone. A girl lying on her bed with a rabbit on her chest answered. They took up the armchair and shoved it into the back of a car. Bleeker handed Juno a note and she beamed. Bleeker was in his brown and yellow sports kit. Juno sat in the armchair on his front lawn. On a rug, a posse of runners in brown and yellow came by. Juno lowered her eyes. Beneath his yellow sweatband, Bleeker's eyes crossed and what little color there was in his pale cheeks washed away. Juno blinked happily. Bleeker swallowed. A thin smile flashed across Juno's heart-shaped face and she cut a pipe between her teeth. She got on her bike and rode off, leaving Bleeker clutching his sandwich. Juno cycled up to Dancing Elk School. She parked her bike and secured it with a chain lock. She made her way past the oncoming throng of students, most of them taller than her, and reached her locker.",
    "635": "He walks tensely back to Graham. Merrill and Graham turn and look behind them as something brushes past the swing. There's an urgent rustling in the maize stalks beyond the swing, which gradually dies away. Next morning, Caroline sits in the dining room with Morgan, who's holding her walkie talkie. Morgan nods. Caroline smiles warmly and nods back. She grins. Bo sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons. Graham walks over. Bo does so. There are three glasses of water on the TV set. Caroline looks across at Merrill, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table. He rests his head on his hand and looks up at her. Merrill grins at Caroline and absently rubs his finger on the table top. She shrugs. Caroline glances at Morgan, who's studying her walkie talkie. She looks back at Merrill. Graham walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table. He leans over and picks them up. He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet. Graham puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room. He sits at the table by Merrill. She checks her notebook. She gives them a patronizing look. Graham looks tense and awkward. She nods. Graham shrugs, and looks uncertainly at Merrill. Graham blows out his cheeks. And Merrill looks at the ceiling. Merrill holds up his hands and turns away in frustration. Bo comes into the dining room and taps Graham on the arm. Bo leaves. Merrill shifts awkwardly. Graham considers for a moment. Bo comes back. Caroline looks up. In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a corn field with a line of crop circles similar to Graham's. A man talks to camera. 17 circles are scattered across a map of India. Footage shows people standing in some of the circles. Graham's steely blue eyes gleam as he stares at the TV. Morgan takes a puff of his inhaler. Caroline stands behind him. Graham and Caroline come out of the house. She shakes her head as they stroll away from the farmhouse. Caroline nods and opens the driver's door of her police car. She smiles and gets in. Graham stands and watches as Caroline pulls around an island of grass in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway. Morgan and Bo sit in the back of a car. Bo points a finger at Morgan. And he brushes it away. Graham turns the radio off again. Graham, in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at Morgan, then, turns back to the road. Morgan sighs wearily. An aerial view looks directly down onto a quiet freeway, which runs through a suburban part of town.",
    "643": "She looks up to the walkway, sees Jamal, and smiles. Suddenly, Jamal notices Salim and two men sprinting on the platform towards Latika. He points behind her. She sees Salim and runs onto a waiting train. Salim finds her and pulls her off the train by her hair. He grimaces towards Jamal rushing down a flight of stairs. Then with the other men, they manhandled the three through the crowd to the exit. Salim forces Latika into a waiting car. Jamal is still trying to weave his way through the crowds. Jamal arrives to see one thug holding a blade to Latika's face. Salim points threateningly at Jamal. The thug slices the blade across her face. He jeers at Jamal as he slams on the car window. Jamal looks on helplessly as the car speeds off into the traffic. Behind the scenes, the host walks into the toilets. Jamal sits in the cubicle. The host goes to the urinal. He leaves the toilets. Jamal exits the cubicle and approaches the sink to wash his hands. He looks at himself in the mirror and sighs. He notices at the bottom of the mirror the letter B has been written in the condensation. His jaw drops as he looks through the door. He looks puzzled as he returns to the studio floor. With a sly look, the host sees Jamal being led in by staff. Jamal sits back in his chair and stares at the host. Lights come on and illuminate the host's false smile. Jamal looks up from the screen to see a nasty grin on the host's face. Again, we see that written in the condensation. The host's face hardens suddenly. Jamal shakes his head. Again, Jamal shakes his head. The host tenses his jaw. The host looks disappointed. The host rubs his chin and shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He shakes his head. With eyebrows raised, he regards Jamal. The audience are on their feet. The director and his assistants all smile. The host gets up. He dances. He pats Jamal patronizingly on the back of his head. Then he glares at the director off-stage. The director gives him a happy thumbs up. The host maintains a grim serious expression. A smile appears fleetingly on Jamal's face as the host grins through gritted teeth. Backstage, the host waits for Jamal to leave. Jamal turns to follow the host down the corridor. He slaps him on the back then grips him by the shoulder. Two policemen stand outside the door. They cover Jamal's head in a blanket. The director approaches the host. The policemen bundle Jamal into a waiting vehicle. Srinivas is at the wheel. At the police station, the inspector and Jamal drink milky tea in glasses.",
    "645": "The teacher spots Salim and Jamal, and the boys get into a fight over a book. The teacher takes the book and hits Jamal on the head with it. In the present day, at the police station, Srinivas puts a VHS tape into a player while Jamal sits slumped in a chair across from the inspector's desk. Srinivas slaps Jamal, who gazes at the ground. The inspector aims the remote control at the TV. On the screen, a five-year-old Jamal squats over a hole in a makeshift toilet while Salim keeps guard outside. A man hurriedly approaches the toilets, and Prakash bends over in pain. Jamal pulls up his pants. The TV shows old clips of Amitabh's 70s action films, and a helicopter flies over Jamal's roofless toilet. Salim wedges his chair against the door, locking Jamal in. Through a hole in the wall, Jamal sees a crowd rushing to the runway and futilely kicks the door. He takes out a creased photo of his hero, Amitabh Bachchan, from his pocket. Looking down through the hole in the floor to the cesspit beneath, then back to the photo, Jamal pinches his nose and jumps in, holding the photo clear of the effluent. Amitabh exits his helicopter to a cheering crowd. Jamal, covered in excrement, rushes towards Amitabh, pushing through photographers and onlookers. Salim stands at the front, hemmed in by security, and sees Jamal running with the photo. The crowd clears a path for Jamal due to his smell, and he goes straight to Amitabh. Salim stares in disbelief as people hold their noses. Amitabh autographs the photo and returns it to Jamal. A hazy orange sun ascends over Mumbai's streets, slums, and skyscrapers. Jamal's mother scrubs him with soap while Salim looks back mischievously and vanishes. Salim enters a cinema's projectionist's booth, showing a man Jamal's autographed photo. The man puts the photo into the projector's light and gives Salim two coins. Salim winks, salutes, and bumps into Jamal outside. Jamal appears on the video, and the policemen watch him. He concentrates intently and smiles briefly. Trains speed through a slum as Jamal's mother washes colorful clothing in a pool, and young Jamal and Salim play in the water. She smiles at them but suddenly looks worried as a train passes, revealing a crowd of armed men approaching. People flee in panic.",
    "65": "Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door, stares at Gittes for a long moment. He gently tugs the car door closed, Evelyn remains unperturbed. He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn looking after him. Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary, she looks up, recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him. The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office. Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment, stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier, he is standing high in the mountains, near a pass. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one, she refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more photographs. Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary, she gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes goes back to the photographs, hears a SCRATCHING SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise. The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor. Gittes heads toward the door, Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office. There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude, Gittes nods, Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton. Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk, Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office, she looks up when he enters. Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her, is sitting, smoking. Gittes buzzes Sophie, Evelyn nods, she lights another cigarette, she signs it. Cross is visibly surprised, Cross nods. Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking, Gittes laughs, Gittes shrugs. Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off, they are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head, Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise, Cross looks hatefully at Gittes. Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans, Gittes approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk, The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles, Gittes regards his back a moment, then goes to the stacks. Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something, the second clerk gets on the phone.",
    "650": "The male singer knees and cradles the body of a woman. A thick mist wafts across the stage. We suddenly see an image of five-year-old Latika chasing a train followed by an image of a very beautiful Latika, now in her 20s. Then, back on the game show, Jamal looks lost in thought. In the director's edit suite. The video plays in the police station. The 10-year-old brothers walk along a pipeline. From an aerial view, we see the boys are heading toward the distant skyscrapers of Mumbai. The city sprawls with high rise apartments and green parks, juxtaposed with huge slums and shanty towns. Jamal walks alone through slum streets strewn with rubbish and debris. He approaches a group of men scavenging on the rubbish tip. Jamal wanders the teeming streets of Mumbai by day, and by night. He questions some young boys his age. They shake their heads. He walks through a crowded night market with stalls selling a thousand and one different things. Then he's in uniform walking through a kitchen. Salim, also in uniform, dozes on a kitchen work top. Salim wakes up. Jamal descends into a subway, where a blind Arvind sings and begs. Jamal stops and recognizes Arvind. Jamal digs into his pockets, finds the $100 bill and gives it to Arvind. Jamal takes the note and turns it over. Arvind feels his way from Jamal's hands up his arms to his face. He smiles. Jamal grips Arvind by the shoulders. Jamal looks happily surprised with the news. Jamal touches Arvind's face gently and runs off along the subway. A worker starts to fumigate the subway. Jamal disappears running through the smoke. He emerges with Salim through exhaust fumes on Pila Street at night. The street is lined with brothels. Prostitutes sitting on chairs on the pavement. Salim questions a woman. She shakes her head and they move on. Jamal asks another woman and she pats his cheek. A girl in a silk costume and jewelry dances whirling round and round. Salim and Jamal wind their way down Pila Street. Women call down from balconies and open windows on men on the crowded street. Salim and Jamal questioned two women who direct the boys to an entrance down the busy corridor. The dancing girl continues her steps under the watchful gaze of an elderly male teacher who claps to maintain her tempo. Jamal and Salim walk through a brothel, pulling aside curtains covering alcoves where couples are having sex. Jamal approaches a girl. The girl points to a closed door. Jamal peers through a crack in the door and sees the beautiful dancing girl. Salim yanks Jamal away and peers through the hole. His eye widens in surprise.",
    "652": "Latika appears and gently pushes Salim's gun down. Jamal looks incredulous as Salim pulls Latika back into the room. Jamal remains rooted to the spot. Back in the police station, the inspector and Srinivas stare at the sweating Jamal. Srinivas grins. Jamal leans over toward the inspector. Two other uniformed policemen rush into the room and eventually subdue a raging Jamal. The inspector wipes the sweat from his hands and face. Jamal carries a tray of tea at the call center. She holds an Eastern magazine. Jamal rushes around, delivering tea to the call center workers. They all sit at computers, wearing headsets. Dave rushes off to a nearby TV showing the game show. Dave signals to everyone. They start to dial the number on their mobile phones. The readout says it has found over 26,000 Latikas as the names scroll across the screen. Jamal gulps and puts on his headset. Across the room, call center managers walk around, monitoring staff calls. Back on the game show, the host shakes his head. The director hands him a check. Jamal is ascending in a lift on the construction site of a skyscraper. Hundreds of meters above, Salim waits. Jamal arrives at the open top floor which has no walls and offers panoramic views of Mumbai. Jamal sees a guy dressed in an expensive shirt, wearing jewelry and dark glasses. Salim smiles and removes his glasses. Jamal lunges for Salim. They both fall off the building. Jamal blinks awake from his vision and punches Salim instead. Jamal and Salim sit on the edge of the building. The vast cityscape is spread out before them. Salim is phoned. Salim shakes his head as he watches his brother go. At night, in Salim's apartment, both Salim and Jamal are asleep. Salim gets up. Jamal opens his eyes but lies still. Jamal sneaks to the landing to spy on Salim downstairs as he loads a gun. Jamal watches as Salim kneels on a mat to pray. Salim touches his forehead to the ground. Salim leaves his apartment block and heads for his car. As Salim drives off, Jamal appears in a tuk-tuk, following closely behind. Salim's car pulls up to a sprawling palatial house situated on the hillside surrounded by construction sites. He drives through the electronic gates. Jamal's tuk-tuk then arrives outside the gates. He jumps out then watches Salim approach a beautiful woman in dark glasses standing on a balcony. Salim collects a small package from her then drives past the gates where Jamal is hiding. The young woman notices Jamal lurking at the entrance as a guard closes the gates. The guard goes to the gatehouse. The woman removes her glasses for a better look at Jamal.",
    "663": "Peter folds up his clothes and lays them down. He does a double take upon seeing his physique in the mirror, flexes his muscles, then turns away from his reflection to reach for his shirt. Looking through the window, he sees Mary Jane, MJ, in her room next door and smiles as she fixes her hair. He returns to the mirror and grins. Coming downstairs, he places one hand on the molding, walks on the wall, turns the corner, then leaps to the ground and heads out. He stands and stares after witnessing an altercation between MJ and her father. MJ, a redhead wearing Calfland's boots, a short skirt, and a zipped cardigan, marches down the sidewalk with her arms folded, reaches the school bus stop, and grinds the sole of her left boot on the ground. Peter trails behind her. MJ climbs into her friend's Ford Mustang Convertible. The school bus speeds past, chased by Peter. He grabs a poster on the side of the bus, ripping it off completely, and is left in the street with it sticking to his fingers. He examines his hand and ponders. Meanwhile, at the Osborne home, Harry rushes into the study where his father is lying face down on the floor and helps him to a seat. Later, Peter has lunch at school and sees MJ approaching with a tray of food. He smiles at her, but she smiles at people behind him. As she passes, she slips on a spilled drink. Peter leaps up, catches her, then the tray, and then the food. He grins inanely as MJ, trying to coax an answer from him, walks off. Peter watches her and sits back down, letting out a big sigh. He raises his right hand and notices a fork sticking to his palm. Unable to shake it off, he pulls it, revealing web-like threads coming from his wrist. It snaps, but another web shoots across to the next table and adheres to a tray. He holds it towards him and ducks as it flies over his head, landing on Flash Thompson, who is with MJ. Covered in mush, Flash turns around as Peter swiftly exits, tracking the tray behind him.",
    "665": "Peter tries again and out flies a column of threads. Palm uppermost, he flexes his wrist again and another web shoots out and falls to the ground. On the third attempt, the web wraps around the jib of the crane. Peter has hold of the other end. He grabs it in both hands and leaps up onto the wall surrounding the roof. He takes a quick glance down to the street below, then studies himself, ready to jump. Clinging for dear life to the web, he swings through the air like Tarzan on a creeper and lands running on the roof opposite. Unable to stop, he smashes into a wall poster and slams to the ground. Later that evening, he races to his aunt and uncle's house. In the darkness inside, he sees the paint, brushes, roller, and tray all set out. He crosses over to the sink where he spots a note. \"Michelangelo! Meat loaf and veggies in the oven.\" His attention is drawn to the argument across at MJ's. His face falls. He takes the garbage out. The backyards of the houses are separated by a small wire fence. MJ barges out of her back door. She stands there for a moment, then turns to Peter. She sticks her hands in her coat pockets, moves a little closer to him, and looks a little coy. He leans on the fence. MJ gives a little shrug of her shoulders. Her eyes fixed on his face, she moves over towards the fence. They both turn on hearing the engine of Flash's convertible. Peter's on his way to look down the passageway between the houses. Peter flicks to the paper, looking at cars for sale. Auto's away offers used cars at great prices over $27,000, over $25,000. He turns the page. Motor Town used cars are cheaper, only around $15,000. On the next page, prices are down to around $3,000. Peter then spots an advert. \"Need cash? Amateur wrestlers, $3,000 for 3 minutes on the ring, colorful characters a must\" and a phone number. He dreams of MJ and the sports car. Peter writes costume possibilities and sketches a cape for go. He writes utility belt then puts the lines for it. He screws up the paper. More sketches then symbol for the question mark. Now he draws spiders on the page. He imagines a spider with red legs and a blue body with a red dot. A red checked mask comes into his mind and the inevitable spider's web. He adds color. Red checks on boots at the blue body stocking. Next to complete the join, red checks all over the head mask show the blades, center strip down the chest and round the waist and a touch of red along the arm.",
    "666": "Next morning, Peter is busy fine-tuning his wrist webbing using a can of Dr. Pepper as a target. He pulls it too and then catches it but is not so lucky with the bed lamp. Peter closes the partly open door, turns around, and sees his room with spider's web dangling from wall to wall. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn is reading the Daily Bugle, but the devils in his mind cause him to close his eyes tightly, and he shakes his head wearily. Uncle Ben gives an OK sign to Aunt May as Peter walks out of the door. Downtown, the four-door automobile pulls up at the curb. Peter looks away, and a look of pain creases Uncle Ben's face. He nods his head slightly, and a somber Peter again looks away from his uncle. Uncle Ben, his face grim, gets ready to move off. Peter climbs out of the car and stands in the middle of the road with a brown paper bag in his hand. He starts to cross the road, watches as his uncle makes a left turn out of sight, and then he walks off away from the library. Peter makes his way up a stairway at the wrestling arena. From the balcony, he watches as Bone Saw McGraw, the master of disaster, slams an opponent on the floor then jumps on him leading with an arm to his throat. The large, long-haired, muscle man takes the plaudits, fans rub big toy saws over their arms, and Bone Saw is massaged by four leather-clad beauties. Peter joins the queue, Bone Saw hauls his opponent out of the ring, grabs the mic, and Peter bolts then slips through the ropes. The crowd chants with hostility as the cage is set up above the wrestling ring. Peter, wearing the spider and web blazoned on his sweatshirt, looks up as the cage is slowly lowered around the ring trapping him in. Bone Saw charges as Peter leaps in the air, and Bone Saw clunks into the cage. Bone Saw jumps up, Peter somersaults out of his way, then uses his web to leap out of reach. Bone Saw is handed a folding chair, he crashes it twice over Peter's head, and when Peter's done, thuds it across his back. Grabbing Peter by a leg, Bone Saw crashes the youth into the cage bars. Bone Saw is handed a golf club. As the big wrestler charges, Peter, on his back on the floor, lashes out with his right foot into Bone Saw's body and face. Bone Saw comes again, Peter uses both feet and propels the big man under the ropes. Bone Saw collapses to the floor. Peter's eyes sparkle with the eye-hole at the balled cover, as he listens to the crowd.",
    "667": "Later, in the arena office, $100 is laid on the desk in front of Peter who waits expectantly. Peter screws up his face, then glares at the promoter and storms out of the office, passing a tall, burly unshaven guy with bleached hair who barges in and throws a canvas bag at the promoter. In the corridor, Peter overhears and sees through the frosted glass wall the gunman hit the promoter. The gunman makes his escape and Peter stands aside as the robber escapes in the elevator. The promoter, with a gash on the right side of his temple, sneers at Peter then heads back along the corridor after the security guard. Peter smacks as he calls the elevator. Outside, he has a hooded jogging top over his sweatshirt and watches police cars draw up. He sees a crowd of people milling around on the sidewalk and looks on curiously. Peter pushes his way through the crowd and finds his uncle lying on the ground. Peter is beside him as the gray-haired old man opens his eyes and tries to focus. His eyes light on Peter and he attempts a smile, taking Peter's right hand in his. Uncle Ben's eyes close, his head lulls to one side, and his grip on Peter's hand loosens until his hand slips out of Peter's grasp. Peter, tears running down his cheeks, looks at the peaceful face of his dead uncle and sobs. Having overheard the cop, Peter's face grows determined, his jaw set, and he stands up and walks away. He runs into a dark alleyway, pulls off his zipped-up jogging top, puts on his balaclava, and becomes Spider-Man. Spider-Man leaps up on a wall at the end of the alleyway, then climbs and leaps up the side of a building. He spots a flagpole on a building opposite and jumps, sailing through the air, grabbing the pole with both hands, then swings round and round until he builds the momentum to catapult him through the air onto the adjoining rooftop. He leaps from roof to roof until he lands on top of a dome. Far below, he sees the automobile being chased by police. He shoots a web to an adjacent building, looks up at the corners of the building to which his web is attached, glances down at the streets way below, then takes a deep breath and launches himself off the dome. As he races towards the building opposite, he shoots another web to pull him away, then another as he zigzags his way along far above the streets. Each time it seems he's going to plummet to the ground, he shoots out another web and pulls himself along.",
    "673": "Peter watches as Aunt May lays flowers on Uncle Ben's grave. He helps the white-haired elderly woman to her feet. Aunt May's coat billows in the stiff breeze, which also blows falling leaves around the two of them. Clutching her bag to her and, with one hand on her hat, she strides away. Peter stands with his back to the departing figure. Later, Peter is sitting at the dining table. Aunt May comes through from the kitchen holding a tea pot. She strides up to the table and pours a cup of tea. She sits down next to him at the table. Peter, in blue shirt and tie and spectacles still on, lowers his eyes then looks at his aunt who sips her tea. He nods his head. She looks at him quizzically. Aunt May stares intently at her nephew. Tears well up in Peter's eyes. He stretches out his hand to place it on hers. Her eyes fixed on Peter's face, Aunt May removes her hand from under his. He gazes at her through tearful eyes and looks away. Aunt May gets to her feet. She leans on the table for support, then about turns and runs up the stairs. Peter sits at the table. Meanwhile, Octavius is in his lab. Two of the limbs push a curved base in a replica fusion chamber in a space from which now four curved pillars rise. Octavius eases the final girder securely it into position. He steps back standing inside the fusion chamber which floats on the river below. He looks up at the structure and the limb. Suddenly, Octavius spins around. Elsewhere, the houseman enters as Harry drinks. Bernard turns and walks out. The lightning flashes making Harry's features in a pallid white. Harry strides over to the open French windows which lead out onto a balcony. He goes outside, his glass in his hand. He stops when he hears a distant thud. He starts to look around the vast terrace-like balcony. Lights on the pillars and small trees and bushes are dormant. The balcony judders as the thuds seem to move closer. Harry, his face grim and curious, steps forward towards the balustrade. As he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet. Harry's glass flies in the air. The pincer catches it. A limb grabs Harry by the ankle. Octavius smiles. The limb hauls Harry back on to the balcony. Aided by another limb, Harry is set down on the ground. He stares at Octavius. The four mighty limbs start to move away with Octavius carried in midair. He turns to Harry. Octavius scuttles like a spider out of Harry's sight. Peter reads it at a newsstand.",
    "677": "Octavious covers his face as Spider-Man fires more webs. Spider-Man somersaults back, jumps to avoid the mechanical limbs, and limbos under a bridge. With two webs attached to two limbs, Octavius manages to catapult Spider-Man towards a covered walkway. Landing on Octavius, Spider-Man knocks him off the roof. Octavius uses one of the limbs to thrust Spider-Man into the train. He crashes through a door, stops at the one opposite, then spins around two poles. He tangles with Octavius who struggles through and climbs up to the roof. Spider-Man turns to see why. He presses himself to the side of the train to avoid an oncoming one. While it passes he cambers out of the roof. Spider-Man spots a limb moving under the train. He crawls down. The passengers find Spider-Man at one window and Octavius at the one opposite. Octavius punches Spider-Man who falls down onto the street below. Quick webs grab him out of the way of cars and up into the air. He swings along beside the elevated track, then bounds over high buildings and flings himself down. He shoots web at Octavius and lands on him. Octavius gets the upper hand, clutching Spider-Man with two of his long metal limbs. He smashes Spider-Man into a train window. He flails Spider-Man, who then manages to stick his feet to the side of the train. Octavius holds him tightly in his arms and his head smashes through signs on the side of the track. A train is coming the other way. Octavius lets go, and the train hits Spider-Man. Swinging gracefully with long of web. Seeing him come, Octavius pulls two passengers from the train and holds them up. He tosses a woman at Spider-Man who swoops down, catches her then deposits her into a web safety net. Next, Octavius throws the man he's holding. Again, Spider-Man sweeps the passenger up before he hits the track, and then places him in a web mat. He punches the driver. As Spider-Man lands behind Octavius, a limb pushes a lever. The train picks up speed, sending the passengers whining. Octavius tosses the lever to Spider-Man. Octavius leaps off the train. Spider-Man heads for the front. A further explosion burns the mask which Spider-Man peels off. Blinks to clear his eyes and realizes the train is hurdling through the city towards the end of the line. The unmasked Spider-Man leaps down onto the track. Raises himself against the train and uses his feet to shove against the sleepers as an attempt to decelerate. Spider-Man jumps back onto the train, clutching his right knee as the train continues its relentless surge through the city. Spider-Man leaps anxiously from side to side, then shoots webs right and left.",
    "678": "The two webs attach to buildings either side of the track, and Spider-Man takes the string. The web breaks and Spider-Man falls forward. As the train hurdles towards the river, a desperate looking Spider-Man fires webs at buildings. A block of web shoots out. Once again, Spider-Man out front takes the strain. It rips Spider-Man's costume in several places, and battles the front of the train as the costume tears away his arms as his hands holds the webs uses them to restrain the train forward thrust. Spider-Man's features are contorted as some of the webs start to break. The train approaches the buffers. It crashes through them and careens forward to the very end. The first carriage teeters over the edge. Spider-Man stands as if glued to the front of the train. He continues to hold the webs attached to the buildings behind them. The train grinds to a halt. Spider-Man's eyes close. He releases the web and slumps forward. Hands reach out to prevent him from falling. The passengers lift the unconscious, unmasked Spider-Man into the carriage. His head falling back, the costumed figure is passed along the carriage over people's heads. Willing hands reaching out to support him, until he reaches the center of the carriage, where he's gently lowered to the floor. His face visible, the passengers stare at him. The kid's eyes open and his gloved hands touch his face. A worried look creeps into his eyes as he realizes he has no mask. He sits up as a passenger crouches down. The passenger looks round and two boys step forward. The younger of the two stretches out his hand. In it, Spider-Man's mask. Peter takes it. Through tear-filled eyes, Peter gazes at the two boys standing in front of him. Then lowers his head, and slips on the mask to become Spider-Man once more. Spider-Man sits up straight. Then, struggling to rise, is helped to his feet by more willing hands. These same hands steady him. The door behind Spider-Man clatters in. Octavius climbs on board. Spider-Man turns to face him. A passenger steps forward. The first man gulps. Others step between Spider-Man and Octavius. He simply smiles. Using two of the limbs, he sweeps them aside, leaving a clear route to Spider-Man. Spider-Man indicates to those around him with a raised palm and a nod of the head, and staggers forward. A punch from a mechanical limb sends Spider-Man to the floor where he lies helpless. An electric storm hovers over the Osborn home. Inside, Harry drinks. He turns to see Octavius holding Spider-Man above his head. Harry points to the couch, where he saw Spider-Man stand over his dead father. Octavius lays the bound figure down.",
    "68": "The car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet. A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler. DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN. The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands. The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by. DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee. The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee. Another CUSTOMER leans in the door. The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model. The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. Hands him a picture. The CUSTOMER exits. Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter. A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. SILENT BOB lights a smoke. SILENT BOB points to something off-screen. SILENT BOB nods. JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face. VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng. Everyone turns to face. VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher. The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C. The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door. VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST. She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly. He reaches into his briefcase. He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads it. He nods. He nods again. She blasts him with more chemical as he exits. He quickly flees. The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances. VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted. DANTE tries to regain his composure. The last of the crowd exits. DANTE is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms. She slaps him.",
    "683": "She moves her left hand to his head. Her fingers caress his temple. Her hand slides down his cheek. His eyelids flicker and almost close. MJ turns and walks slowly away. Peter lowers his head and swallows. His head droops. With a smile on her face, she saunters away. Peter enters his apartment building. He climbs a dark stairway and reaches a landing. A door opens behind Peter. A man playing cards looks out at him. He snatches it. He screws up his face. Mister Ditkovich's daughter, Ursula, drops a ladle and sets fire to the stove. The door is shut in Peter's face. Peter lets himself into his apartment. He switches on the light in his single room home. He rolls off the satchel strapped to his back, sits down on the bed, his face glum. His back is to the opened window. On the bedside cabinet, photos of Aunt May, Uncle Ben and MJ. Beside them is a radio set, which he switches on. The morning sun lights up the skyline of New York. Mister Ditkovich barges past Peter and into the restroom. He closes the door, then opens it. Peter leans forward and shuts the door. Harry and Peter enter a lab. Harry leaves Peter with Doctor Octavius. Peter looks around. They're having tea. The doctor nods. Peter is in a laundromat, reading Longfellow. He lays the volume down on top of a pile of other poetry books and goes to the washing machine. He opens it. As he stretches in to remove the laundry, he looks across at the only other person in the laundromat, who is paying him no attention. Peter stuffs the Spider-Man costume in his bag, then checks his boxers. The white is now stained with blue and red from the costume. Ditto his once white socks. Peter stands by the window of his apartment. He lugs off his T-shirt, drops the shirt on the floor and opens the curtain door of his wardrobe. Hanging on the rail, a Spider-Man outfit, and a suit, shirt and tie. In front of the mirror, he fastens the tie. He runs down the stairs. He's in his boxers. His daughter stares as he pulls up his trousers and walks into a room. Cabs pull up outside the theater. MJ's face is displayed prominently at the entrance. As crowds walk into the foyer, and tickets are checked and stubs torn off, MJ is suiting with a fellow actress in makeup. Half grinning, Peter picks up a bunch and hands over some money. The florist taps him on the shoulder, takes the flowers and hands him back a single stem with three flowers on it. Backstage. Peter glides serenely along a street on his moped.",
    "689": "Spider-Man and Octavius crash through an office window. Spider-Man pummels Octavius' face before the limbs grab Spider-Man's head and toss him about. Both men fall out of the window. Meanwhile, the material of Aunt May's brolly starts to tear, and she slips down on it. Octavius tosses Spider-Man across the street into a window in the block opposite, as Aunt May slips further down the brolly. Aunt May's feet land on a ledge, and she looks way down to the ground, then up at the face of the statue whose outstretched arms she'd hooked her brolly around. She's lifted off the ledge as Spider-Man sticks two webs to the window frames and stretches them back like a catapult. As Spider-Man launches himself through the air, a pincer on one of the limbs becomes a pointed spear. Octavius stretches out the spear-like limb towards Spider-Man, but Aunt May smacks Octavius on the head with her brolly. Spider-Man grabs the limb, and Octavius releases Aunt May. Spider-Man dives to her rescue, catching her, and they swoop and swing down the street. The police fire at Octavius, but with bags of money in one pincer, he disappears around the corner of the building. Spider-Man lands with Aunt May, cocks his head, then leaps up on a web. Girls flock to Aunt May as Spider-Man, firing webs as he goes, sweeps through the skies from building to building across New York City. The planetarium with its suspended glass curtain wall stands 95 feet high, and inside it is a sphere constructed of fabricated aluminum panels. Peter is in the crowded planetarium and reaches for food, but someone grabs the last canopé from a waitress's tray. A couple walks by, and Peter raises his camera. Realizing the lens cap is still on, Peter removes it, but by this time, the couple has walked away. Harry pours a drink, then, snatching the bottle, knocks over his glass. Peter walks up to him, and the two old friends stare defiantly at each other. The Mayor glares as all heads turn to look at the stairway down into the planetarium. Captain Jameson is in uniform with a young lady walking beside him arm-in-arm. Everyone applauds, except Peter who sees the young lady is MJ in a black strapless dress, her hair tied up. MJ stares at Peter and turns her head away. He gazes, mesmerized. Later, Peter makes his way out onto the balcony. A server has a tray with one canopé on it, and he reaches for it as someone else whisks it away. Peter sees MJ alone, pauses, then walks up behind her. MJ turns to face him. Peter gulps, his eyes fill up, and he watches forlornly as MJ strides away from him. A waitress passes, and Peter grabs a cocktail glass.",
    "69": "VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor. A handsome young man, WILLAM, is standing at the counter, and VERONICA reacts to him. A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension. DANTE waits on a customer in the interim. VERONICA counts silently, using fingers as marks, then stops counting. DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door. She exits in a huff, violently letting go of him. VERONICA went. DANTE swings the door open and yells out. Two men walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction. DANTE stands there in silence for a moment. A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. It's twenty after. He should be here soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. DANTE studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare. He storms out. DANTE lifts a ring of keys from the counter. The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug. Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door. RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up and stops RANDAL. A pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a single key on top. RANDAL marches off, balancing the pile of tapes on his head. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later. RANDAL smiles. We've seen this same routine before. A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He picks the cat up, walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it. He holds a list in his hand. DANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. THE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO. RANDAL dials the phone. A CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box. A black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts pawing around. The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.",
    "690": "A burst of light reveals a woman dressed in a white classical robe with a blue stole draped over her arm standing on top of a shallow pyramid of steps holding a blazing torch high in her right hand. Pages from a superhero comic book flick rapidly down the screen. A spinning war vortex of blue light becomes a silver blue spider's web which scatters the words of the opening credits. More splintered images reveal earlier moments in the story. A spider bites Peter Parker. Peter looks at his changing physique in a mirror watched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Peter has fun with redheaded Mary Jane and crawls up a wall like a spider. Uncle Ben's wise, kindly face appears. Spider-Man in his skintight red and blue webbed suit swings lively from thread to thread like a trapeze artist. More credits appear and blow away as if made of sand. A tangle of sinister black, sticky tendrils crawl across everything in their path. On a street, Peter Parker rips open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man suit beneath. Mary Jane in a long white dress looks reproachfully at Peter in the final fractured image. The broken mirror pieces slot together, becoming the blue sky above New York City. Spider-Man swings through the air, high above the city streets. Peter rides his small moped. A student aims a peashooter at Peter's neck. A blonde hottie appears. Gwen Stacy smiles at Peter. Another student shines a light in Peter's face. Peter steps up to the ticket window. He makes his way to his seat. As he sits down in the center of the front row a couple of large men sit on either side of him. The lights go down. The curtains open, revealing a starry backdrop. Mary Jane descends a staircase wearing a glamorous, long, white dress. Peter grins proudly and mouths the lyrics. In a balcony seat to the side of the auditorium, dark-haired Harry Osborne is watching Mary Jane through opera glasses. He lowers the glasses, then his gaze settles on Peter sitting below him in the stalls. Peter, lost in Mary Jane's performance, is totally unaware of Harry's malevolent stare. Following a couple of young women out of the theater, Peter grins with pleasure. He spots someone up ahead. Harry slowly turns to face him. Harry gets into the back of his chauffeur-driven limo and is driven away, leaving Peter standing helplessly on the pavement. In Mary Jane's dressing room. Mary Jane smiles warmly. Peter beams happily. In the Goblin Lair at the Osborne mansion several incarnations of the demonic Green Goblin mask are displayed on stands along with a number of high tech weapons and futuristic flying equipment.",
    "693": "Spider-Man, in a black suit, watches as Flint crumbles away. Later, Peter, having changed out of the suit, walks through a dilapidated breeze block building and stops to glance in a chipped mirror. He tugs down his floppy forelock and stares intently at his reflection, his forehead puckered into a frown, his eyes fierce. Outside his digs, his landlord is mopping the floor as Peter glances at the landlord's daughter watching from a doorway. The young woman approaches her father. In his flat, Peter closes the French windows to the small balcony and paces restlessly. He examines his reflection in a mirror and unbuttons the front of his shirt, revealing the top of the black spider suit with its gray web and spider emblem. He looks down at it uncertainly, his eyes wide and tinged with fear, then tosses the black suit back into the trunk and backs away from it wearily. Later, he visits Aunt May, who looks into his eyes. Peter blinks uncertainly, his expression wavering, and glances at Aunt May's kindly face. Later still, Mary Jane steps out of the doorway of a jazz restaurant, its blue and red neon sign not yet switched on, offering nightly music, food, drink, and dancing. With a glum expression, she gazes out into the gray daylight, pulls her coat collar around her neck, and heads away down the street. Walking along the crowded pavement, Mary Jane looks wretched and alone. She slumps down onto a bench and calls up a dial list on her mobile, highlighting the name Peter Parker, then hesitates and scrolls up to Harry Osborne. Meanwhile, Harry is expertly painting a still life. Peter picks up a payphone in the hallway outside his room, drops a coin in the slot, sighs, and hangs up. His landlord steps out of his flat, peeling an orange, and Peter looks at him searchingly, causing the landlord's eyes to widen. Father and daughter go into their flat, and the daughter peeps back out and waves. At the top of the Osborne luxury apartment building, lift doors open into a palatial wood panel penthouse where Harry is waiting for Mary Jane. She takes a deep unhappy breath as Harry gets busy in the kitchen, spooning chopped peppers into one pan, melting butter in another, and turning up the music with a remote. Grinning cheerfully, he looks over his shoulder at Mary Jane chopping vegetables on the simple kitchen table. She grins back at him and starts to dance the twist. Harry smiles at her and, as she tries to get him to join in, she drags him away from the stove. He joins in, bending his knees as he crouches lower and lower. Behind him, the pan starts to smoke.",
    "696": "Peter takes a cookie, then pulls a face and drinks his glass of milk. Later, he struts and jives down the street like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. A slender Black woman passing by gives him a pitying glance. In Jameson's office, he stands very close to Betty, sneers, and then sits in Jameson's chair. He helps himself to a bowl of sweets, puts his feet up on the desk with a supercilious smile, leaving Robbie and Jameson looking dumbfounded. Out on the street, Peter jives down the road, making shooting gestures with his fingers at any pretty girl who walks by. He swaggers into a clothes shop and comes out wearing a sharp black suit and black open neck shirt. On the pavement, he launches into another hip-thrusting '80s dance routine. People on the street give him strange looks and hurry on by. He swaggers away coolly. On the outskirts of the city, water from a sewer outfall drops into a pond, a line of bubbles cleave the water, leaving a trail behind. A muddy figure made of sand materializes on the swampy bank and hauls itself upright. Drying out and becoming human, Flint stares at his hands, with a locket and chain dangling from his fingers with Penny's photograph. He gazes at the tiny image, his eyes filled with resolve. Peter is with Gwen, as Brock watches bitterly as they cross the street towards the jazz club. Gwen looks around, and Peter spots Mary Jane waitressing. He beckons the hostess and slips her a wad of money, then gallantly gestures for Gwen to sit down. He sits behind her, facing the on-stage back. Mary Jane goes by with a tray of drinks, and Gwen notices Peter glance at her. Mary Jane puts down her tray and hurries up onto the stage. Peter glances at Gwen out of the corner of his eye and slips away to the stage. Just as Mary Jane is about to sing, he comes in on piano. Gwen looks up and realizes it's Peter playing. He kicks away the stool, leaps onto the piano, and dances over the tables. Grabbing a martini from a customer, Peter swings across the room on a chandelier, puts his legs around the chair, and slides back across the dance floor, scattering customers. He drops to the floor, spins the chair, and poses with it. He dances towards Gwen and rips his black suit jacket off his shoulders. She gasps. He tosses the jacket towards Mary Jane on stage and strikes a series of poses. Clicking his fingers, he salsas over to Gwen holding out his hand. She takes it and rises to her feet, as Mary Jane looks devastated.",
    "697": "They start to dance slowly, their faces close together. Peter suddenly throws in a fancy move. Gwen throws her head back. Peter puts his hand on her thigh and raises her leg. As the number ends, he bends her over in his arms. Peter's cold black eyes settled on Mary Jane who looks devastated. Gwen follows his gaze and turns to him in shock. She gives Peter a reproving look and crosses to Mary Jane who's standing motionless behind the microphone. Gwen pushes her way past Peter. Mary Jane hurries from the stage. Peter, looking uncertain, puts his hand to his chest. He comes up behind Mary Jane with a hostile scowl. She turns to face him with scorn in her eyes. Peter pins a bouncer against the wall and starts beating off two more. He lashes out, sending Mary Jane careering to the floor. His vicious expression turns to wide eyed shock as he realizes what he's done. His eyes well up, then he glances down at the Black Spider-Man suit under his dark open neck shirt. Covering the suit with his hand, he turns away from Mary Jane and hurries out into the night. Mary Jane, still sitting on the floor, looks around helplessly. Out in the rains wet street, Peter, keeping his hand clasped both his collar, steps into a doorway to think. Drawn by the sound of the bells, he looks up at the torrential rain pours down. A flash of lightning illuminates a Gothic church with a tall studded aspire topped by a stone crucifix. The storm clouds slowly drift away, leaving a lowering gray sky. Perch tie up on the studded side of the steeple, black-suited Spider-Man looks at his hand, flexes his fist, then drops from his perch like a bird shot from a tree. He plummets down to a square archway, leading to the bell tower of the imposing cathedral, decorated with an intricate network of Gothic arches and flying buttresses. Inside the cathedral, Eddie Brock dips his fingers in a font of holy water and crosses himself before the altar. Up in the bell tower, Spider-Man claws at his mask, desperately trying to tear it off. It tears and stretches like rubber then snaps back like a second skin. He falls against the bell in a struggle. For a second, the mask seems to disintegrate then snaps back into place. Brock looks up at the sound. Peter pulls up the mask, ripping it across his contorted features. The black threads of the Symbiote sticking to his face like bulging veins. As if in a trance, Brock is drawn to the screams of his nemesis, pushing open a door that leads to a staircase winding around the walls of the bell tower.",
    "7": "The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, and then he pulls the drapes shut. Cars ZOOM past in the rain. Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE on the STEREO. She leans over and opens the glove compartment, taking out her GLOCK. Jane stands across the room from her, while Angela is sprawled across the bed. There is a KNOCK on the door. Jane jumps up and opens the door, letting him in. Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door and exits, SLAMMING the door behind her. Jane turns to Ricky and he takes her in his arms. Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying. We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW through the RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses. Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside, watching. We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed. Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. And then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being watched. Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the window. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us. The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp CLAP of THUNDER. The Colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented. The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester. The Colonel moves closer towards him, grins, and so does the Colonel. He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel closes his eyes and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned, and then he pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face crumples in shame. The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She holds the GLOCK in her hand. Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse. The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER. He opens his beer and starts toward the family room. Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards us apprehensively, then puts on a slightly defiant smile. She smiles. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand.",
    "70": "**Narrative:**\n\nDANTE hangs up the phone, looks at a paper ruefully, shaking his head, then sniffs the air. Meanwhile, JAY, SILENT BOB, and OLAF lean against a wall. OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB, then looks the girls up and down, makes a metal face, laughs, shakes his head, and busts a crimson metal sneer, cackling deeply. The theme to Star Wars plays. RANDAL, leaning back in his chair, stares up at the TV, stands, points the remote, clicks the TV off, ponders, locks the door and walks away, while OLAF sings for a small crowd. A can pops off, causing DANTE to stagger back a few steps. A man rubs his hand and exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister away, and RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store. DANTE steps behind the counter, and a BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them but soon exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment, then RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER, with a face of utter disbelief, seems a tad flabbergasted but not put off, smirking smugly at RANDAL and his paper. She half turns, tries again with a different approach, but RANDAL continues to read, not looking up. She tries harder, louder, and more direct, holding up her rental choices, but RANDAL reads on. She shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall. An angry WOMAN opens the door and storms out. RANDAL hops over the counter, whips the door open, is offended, closes the door, and stands there momentarily appalled, then shakes his head. He reaches behind the counter, grabs a ring of keys, exits, locks the door behind him, gives it a tug, and storms off in the opposite direction from the woman. DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL hurls the door open and launches into his tirade. An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs, all opened. He holds an egg up to the light, studies it from several different angles, grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it open, and examines each egg carefully. RANDAL snickers at his friend, and both RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity. The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor.",
    "700": "Peter frees himself and punctures Venom. They fall off the web and plummet down the side of the skyscraper as they're falling down the lift shaft, trading kicks and blows as they go. Peter tries to pull his mask back on but drops it as he fires a thread just as he's about to hit the ground. He lands in a deserted construction site, his suit ripped and torn. He retrieves his mask then looks up sharply as the truck starts dropping towards the cab. Mary Jane leaps out of the cab just before the truck hits it and clings to the web. The sandy ground shakes, knocking Spider Man over as if a rug is being pulled from under him. Out of a moving mountain of sand Sandman rises to his feet, towering over the cowering crowd like a colossus. The crowd scatters as the huge, hulking, King Kong-like figure slams a car sized fist into the ground, narrowly missing Spiderman, who looks up at Mary Jane, clinging onto the web. Spider-Man dodges being squashed like a bug beneath Sandman's truck sized foot. He whizzes past the giant beast on threads, with Sandman swatting at him as if he was a fly. Mary Jane loses her grip, landing on the lower section of webs splayed out like a sacrificial victim. She watches Spider-Man hurtling towards her. Venom leaps out at Spider-Man, knocking him into column of girders that he bounces against as he falls. He lands on a horizontal girder and turns to face Sandman, who slowly pulls himself up to his full height and towers over him like an elephant looking down on a mouse. Standing beneath the girder, Venom fires a thread down Spider-Man's neck and pulls him onto his back, garroting him as Sandman brings his fist down like a steam hammer. Spider-Man desperately reaches out a hand as he tries to free himself. The web holding the cab above Mary Jane starts to break as Spider-Man is pummeled by Sandman's fist. His mask torn. Peter stretched out his hand towards Mary Jane. She looks down helplessly as Sandman smashes his fist down on Peter, whose hand hangs limply at his side. Sandman rear up for another blow. A pumpkin bomb, which to Sandman is the size of a pimple, is fired into the side of his head. Half of Sandman's head is blown away, and what's left of it looks like a bowl of burning coals. A searchlight picks out the new goblin gliding through the air on his sky stick. He sends Venom flying through some walls with a flick of his sky stick. His mask peeling back to reveal Harry's disfigured face, he glides up alongside battered Peter.",
    "701": "A screen shows a scan of a human body, next to it, a high tech hoverboard. The door of a glass chamber slides open and green smoke pours out. Harry, wearing just a pair of shorts, steps out of the chamber. He takes a deep breath and smirks. In a dark, peaceful forest, Peter and Mary Jane, lying on a huge hammock-like web on their backs, are watching for shooting stars. Mary Jane shuts her eyes very tightly, and a faint smile falls across her face. She smiles, and they kiss tenderly. A fiery meteor plummets from the sky and smacks down in the forest. Mary Jane and Peter, wrapped in each other's arms, are oblivious to it. The glowing orange meteor embedded in the ground cracks open. Black tendrils, like living vines, spring out of it and stretch across the ground. Peter, smiling happily, slides down a thread of webbing with Mary Jane, unaware of the tendrils crawling up a nearby ridge like a huge black spider. Peter wraps his moped. With Mary Jane sitting on the pillion seat, it starts to move off. The strange black substance crawls speedily up behind and attaches itself to the rear number plate, as the moped rides off down the woodland track. At night, a train rumbles across a bridge in the heart of Brooklyn. Close by, a burly fair-haired man in an orange jumpsuit runs down a dark street. A police car with a search lamp mounted by the passenger window turns onto the street behind him and drives down the road at a walking pace. The man, Flint Marko, hides in the shadows and watches nervously as the squad car cruises past. Flint grabs the bottom rungs of a metal ladder mounted on a wall. He holds himself up and climbs the ladder to a fire escape outside a bedroom window. Gently, he opens the window and climbs into the dark bedroom. He looks down at a little girl of about 10 years old asleep in bed. She has a tube connected to her nose. Flint sits down on the window sill as he gazes at her intently. He reaches into his jumpsuit and takes out a handful of letters addressed to Penny Marko. Flint reaches over and gently slides the letters underneath Penny's pillow. He pulls open a drawer and takes out a green-and-black- striped T-shirt. In the dark kitchen, he breaks some bread in half. He turns sharply as the light comes on and looks at a blond woman in her 40s with her arms folded, wearing a disenchanted expression. They both turn to the door. Penny, who's overheard, comes in. Flint walks over to her, kneels down in front of her, and gently takes her arm.",
    "705": "Harry banks around and sees Peter swinging between the buildings. He zooms down after Peter, who swings into a narrow gap between the tall buildings, propelling himself along from thread to thread. Harry turns the Sky Stick side on so he can fly along the narrow gap, dodging fire escapes and air con units as he air boards after Peter. Harry pulls a glowing green sword from a scabbard on his back and slashes wildly at Peter, who swerves out of the way. Harry soars above Peter, then plummets down to stab him but misses. Harry hurls a small, golden pumpkin bomb at Peter, which opens up in mid-air into a kind of flying metallic bat. Harry throws more bombs at Peter; they slash at Peter who desperately tries to swing out of their way. He jumps off a pipe and swings back the way he came, just missing Harry. The winged bombs surge after Peter and Harry gets caught in the swarm. One of them embeds its wing in his shoulder. He yanks it out, zooms upwards into the air, and swoops on after Peter. Peter swings backwards, shooting webbing at the bombs and disabling them. One of them, in a thread, and swings it back at Harry. Harry flies through the explosion, shielding his eyes. He hits the line of thread stretched out in front of him and bounces off a pipe and a wall, tumbling towards an alleyway below. Peter, his eyes widening with alarm, swings down towards him. Harry lies motionless on the ground. He hurries over to his unconscious old friend. Peter crouches down and holds his ear to Harry's mouth. He yanks open Harry's dark green jacket and starts pumping his chest. He listens again for signs of life. He carries his friend to an emergency room. Peter watches through a window as a crash team try to revive Harry. A detective hands a file to tall, thin faced Captain Stacy. A police dog handler blows a whistle and points. Flint sprints across waste ground with armed officers running behind him. As he reaches a wire mesh fence an Alsatian lunges at him. He wrestles the dog off and punches it away. Flint climbs. Flint runs on and suddenly falls into a huge pit. Flint tumbles down a concrete wall and lands heavily on a pile of sand in the bottom of the pit. Slowly, he hauls himself to his feet and looks desperately from side to side. He's caught in a dazzling beam of light. Above the pit, three glowing capacitors begin to rotate like a merry-go-round. Flint looks up nervously as the capacitors descent towards him and spin around him. They kick up a sandstorm with Flint trapped in the middle.",
    "709": "As pedestrians scatter, one of the cops stops along the side of the lorry with his gun drawn. He looks up and sees the tarpaulin rippling. He gestures to his partner, who holsters his gun and climbs a ladder on the back of the lorry. He unfastens one of the ropes attached to the tarpaulin. The tarpaulin flies off to reveal a cargo of tightly-packed sand. The cop at the back of the lorry makes his way across the sand with a shovel. He stops and raises the shovel like a spear. Sand pushes the cop off the lorry onto the windscreen of a car. A huge wave of sand spreads across the top of the lorry and forms into a gigantic hand which crumbles on the police gunfight. Sandman rises up like a walking giant as a group of cops take aim. As bits of Sandman crumble away in the gunfire, he sweeps down at the cops bursts in a bucket of sand blocking cars over as if they were toys. At the key of the city ceremony, Gwen Stacy is at the lectern flanked by city dignitaries. Photographers turn away from the stage pointing their lenses to the sky as red and blue balloons are released and Spider-Man comes swinging through the crowd, high-fiving them as he sweeps past on a thread. He perches on top of the stage. He glides onto the stage upside down. As Spider-Man hangs upside down in front of her, Gwen peels back his mask, exposing his mouth, and plants a passionate kiss on him. Mary Jane looks on in shock. She walks off. Everyone looks up as a string of sand whizzes past like an express train. Elsewhere in the city, security guards load up an armored van with cash bags. As the van doors are closed the sandstorm zooms in like a swarm of angry bees. The guard driving looks at the shadow alongside the van as the mass of sand forms into a human shape standing on the roof. Sandman punches a hole on the roof and boards inside, overwhelming the guards with a torrent of sand. The weight of the sand presses the accelerator on the van, picks up speed. Flint is zipping up a bag of cash as Spider-Man drops through the hole in the roof of the van behind him. Spider-Man dodges a couple of punches then puts his fist through Flint's stomach. Flint's sandy fist swells to a huge size. He punches Spider-Man through the back of the van, ripping the door off. Spider-Man fires a thread at the runaway van, leaps onto the torn off door, and he's dragged along like a water skier as he dodges cars.",
    "711": "City lights glow behind giant letters sitting on a cliff surrounded by shining spotlights. In sepia tone film footage, people wearing early 20th century clothing stand on a dock and wave toward a massive ocean liner, the RMS Titanic. Passengers on board the moored ship doff their hats or wave to the people below. Surrounded by inky darkness, a pair of small bluish white lights glow. The lights grow brighter as two objects approach, now revealed to be deep sea submersives. The two subs disappear as they sink into the dark ocean depths. Later, the subs creep just above the ocean floor, their lights illuminating a small expansive pale sand. A triangular shape appears on a sonar screen. Ahead of the submersible, a prow of the sunken ocean liner looms up. A brown-haired man cranes his neck as he stares out of one of the submersible portals. One sub rises over the tapered bow and railing, which are covered in a growth resembling drippy, gray concrete. The sub's bright lights shine over a thick chain lying across a ship's deck. The sub moves forward, stirring up clouds of sediment as the second sub follows close behind. A brown-haired man films himself with a camcorder as he stares out the window at the wreck. The man smiles at a bearded crew mate. Both subs glide over the wreck and illuminate twisted metal shapes encrusted with grayish growth. They pass alongside upper balconies running down the side of the ship. The man sets down his camcorder as the subs descend toward the wreck. Lights illuminate rectangular windows with panes of broken glass. A crewman operates a remote control with a joystick. Outside, a small robotic vehicle attached to a tether engages from the sub. Duncan enters a hole in the side of the hull and films a door with an ornate leaded glass window. Powered by a small propeller, Duncan glides past the door. Outside, the other sub releases a second remotely operated vehicle. Snoop Dog descends into an open pit in the ship's hull. Snoop Dog moves through an opening, its bright lights illuminating a crystal chandelier still dangling from a ceiling. Snoop Dog glides up a corridor. A partially decayed boot lies on the sediment beside a pair of eyeglasses missing one lens. Nearby, a porcelain doll's face juts out of the silt. Snoop Dog's lamps shine into a bunk room. A broken door lies on the floor beside a dilapidated bed frame. The bearded crewman stares into a visor as he pilots Snoop Dog through. A pale eel slithers through the water as Snoop Dog approaches an elaborately carved fireplace surround and a mantel. One of the robotic explorers shines its lights on the rotted remains of a grand piano.",
    "722": "Snoop Dog glides into a room where the remains of a wooden bed lie collapsed on the floor. Another eel swims past a porcelain bathtub as Snoop Dog pivots toward a broken door lying in the silt. The bearded man grasps the two joysticks as Snoop Dog extends a pair of mechanical claws. Snoop Dog moves the door aside and uncovers a square object. The brown-haired man squints as he studies a video monitor. The silt settles, revealing an unopened safe. On the ocean surface, a research vessel outfitted with cranes plucks the submersibles out of the water. Men cheer as a winch raises a net holding the safe to the surface. Lewis uncorks a bottle of champagne and sprays everyone as a crewman opens the safe with a cutting wheel. A man pulls off the door, unleashing a flood of muddy water. As a cameraman films him, Brock kneels and pulls out wads of sodden papers. He removes a muddy ledger, which he tosses aside. Brow furrowed, he empties the safe. Scowling at the safe, Brock stands. Later, Brock takes a phone call. Nearby lab techs clean the muddy papers, revealing a sketch of a woman. Reclining on a settee, the naked woman wears a large pendant around her neck. Brock studies a photograph of a pendant necklace with a heart-shaped gem. The same necklace the woman in the drawing is wearing. Elsewhere, in a home, a young, long-haired woman walks past a small dog as she carries teacups to a table. In an adjoining sunroom, a white-haired woman uses a pottery wheel. Leaning on a cane, the older woman steps toward a small television set in a nearby kitchen. Brock stands on the research area. Brock uses a satellite phone. Holding the small white dog on her lap, Rose and the young woman ride inside a helicopter as it flies out to the research ship. Brock and Lewis move to a railing as the helicopter approaches. They move towards the landing pad as the helicopter touches down. Crewman unloads several suitcases and a large trunk. Rose shakes Brock's hand. The long-haired woman smiles and pushes Rose away in a wheelchair. A man aboard the helicopter hands a fishbowl to Brock. Later, Rose sets framed photographs beside the fishbowl. In the lab, Rose peers down at the clean sketch which rests in a container of clear liquid. She closes her eyes. A blonde man with a few stray locks over his eyes sketches the drawing. Rose smiles as she picks up the silver hand mirror. Rose turns the mirror in her hands, catching her own reflection in the cracked glass. She sets down the mirror and examines other objects. She picks up a silver and glass hair comb adorned with an ornamental insect with outstretched wings.",
    "724": "Cal steps on a piece of broken banister and falls. He stands, picks up the gun, and runs after Jack and Rose, who run to the bottom of the staircase. Cal aims but doesn't fire. He knocks a man out of his way, then shoots again. Jack and Rose run down another staircase, then jump into waist-high water. Cal runs into the water. Jack and Rose hurry into the dining room. Cal aims, but the gun is empty. Cal looks around himself at the rising water. Jack and Rose run through the dining room. Cal climbs several steps, then stops. He chuckles to himself as Lovejoy appears. Rose and Jack run down a passageway. They turn, then run down more stairs. Stopping, Jack presses his finger to his mouth. In the dining room, a glass door swings slowly through the water. Small waves push plates and silverware, as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway. At the far end, a small boy stands against a wall. Water pours down the steps, and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe. Jack picks up the boy, then watches as water shoots in from cracks. They turn and run back up the passageway. They stop as water rushes into the passageway ahead of them. As they run in the opposite direction, a man, the boy's father, steps into the hall. The man grabs the boy from Jack, then knocks Jack against a wall. The man runs off with the boy, and Jack and Rose run after him. The man picks up a suitcase, then gapes at the door, which bursts. Water rushes in, knocking the man over. Water rushes after them as they run down the passageway. A wave knocks them over, and rushing water carries them away. Water pours around them as lights flicker. Jack struggles against the current toward a stairwell. They pull themselves along a wall toward the stairwell. Jack pushes Rose through the shoulder-high water toward the railing. Rose grabs the railings and climbs to another locked gate. Jack shakes the gate as the water rises below them. The water reaches their feet. A steward runs past them. The steward returns for them. He tries several keys in the lock, as water swirls around them. The water reaches their thighs. Sparks shoot nearby. The steward fumbles with the keys and then drops underwater. Holding onto the grate with one hand, he reaches for the keys. Jack grabs the keys, then resurfaces. Jack reaches around the grate with the key, but misses the lock. He slips the key into the lock. He turns the key. Rose opens the gate.",
    "728": "Stacks of plates slide off the shelves and smash on the floor. A life boat flows people away from the part of the ship which rises several stories into the night sky. People slide down the slanted deck. Jack's eyes widen as he watches people and deck chairs smashed with each other. A brunette woman slips out of a man's grasp and slides on the deck on her stomach. All along the Titanic people dangle from ropes, spill from railings or slide down into the ocean. More people climb over the railing at the back of the ship. One man jumps and free falls into the icy water where small groups of survivors cling to floating debris. Standing at the rear railing, the black-haired baker watches a falling man bounce off one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink. Jack wraps his arms around Rose as she grips onto the railing. Sitting beside Molly in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance. Also in a lifeboat, Ismay turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut. A crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker. A shock flings him. All along the Titanic electric lights flicker then go out. As the rear of the ship continues to tilt upward, blood streaming down his forehead, Lovejoy grips a side railing as it splits apart. Inside the ship a ceiling collapses as several support columns fail. Small explosions shoot flames from portholes. A pair of men slide into the widening chasm. The mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging back toward the sea. The back of the Titanic slaps down on the ocean surface crushing dozens. The last of the funnels topples over as water rushes into the gap between the two sections, which are still joined at the bottom. The Titanic rapidly fills with water and sinks. Jack climbs over the railing at the back of the ship as it tilts skyward rapidly. Passengers manage to scramble over the railing. Sheets of water shimmer in the moonlight which rises up from the ocean. People dangling from railings lose their grips and fall. One man bounces off a cab stand before slamming into other people hanging on below, creating a domino effect of falling bodies. A blonde maid dangles from the railing near Rose, who looks into the young woman's eyes as she loses her grip and falls. Her breath visible in the cold air, Rose turns toward the baker who crouches on the railing beside her. He returns her silent gaze. The entire ship sinks.",
    "729": "Air pressure blows water out of compartments as the ocean roils around the ship, sinking it deeper. Dozens of passengers still dangle from poles or lie against railings and staircases. Jack keeps one arm wrapped around Rose as they descend toward the water. One man slips off a pole and spins as he bounces off a railing. Some people behind the ship try to swim as the massive propellers sink below the surface. Jack and Rose hold hands as they kneel beside one another. Rose nods as the bubbling water covers the tail rudder and surges up the whole deck. Waves swell around the name Titanic and across the ship. Deep gulps of air are taken as the tail end of the ship sinks beneath the surface. Underwater, Jack and Rose hold hands as they tumble in the jostling current. The ship sinks and vanishes. Jack grabs onto Rose's life vest but is swept away by the turbulence. Rose kicks to the surface and emerges amid other flailing survivors. For at least a quarter mile, the ocean churns with panicked swimmers. One man grabs onto Rose and shoves her underwater as he tries to climb on top of her. Jack punches the hysterical man in the face until he releases Rose. Jack pulls Rose by her life vest, and they swim out of the mass of survivors. Jack leads her to a flat piece of wood floating on the surface. Rose pulls herself onto the elaborately carved panel. Jack tries to pull himself onto the panel as well, but it tips under their combined weight. Jack holds onto the panel as he floats in the water beside her. Jack looks down, then blinks and nods to himself. Lying on her stomach on the panel, Rose moves toward Jack and leans her forehead against his face. Their breath is visible in the cold air. He takes her hand. Clinging to a nearby piece of debris, a crewman blows into a whistle. Rose's blue lips tremble as she smiles weakly. Sitting in a lifeboat beside Molly, Ruth closes her eyes. Furrowing her brow, Molly looks around at the other people in the boat who avert their gaze. A young woman sobs. Molly glares at the crewman then sits. Beside her, Ruth presses hands over her own ears. Elsewhere, survivors in four lifeboats work to lash the vessels together. A dark-haired crewman supervising the operation glances back toward the site of the wreck. Still clinging to wreckage, the crewman with the whistle in his mouth floats motionless with his eyes closed. Swimming a few yards away, Jack stares at the man, then turns toward Rose. Rose's lips tremble as she stares at Jack.",
    "73": "Jay deals with a customer as Silent Bob looks on, then the two exit. Dante, alone, studies his summons, rubs his forehead, spins angrily, and then softens his expression. He hops behind the counter and attends to customers paying for items while he continues to talk. More customers come to the counter. Jay and Silent Bob lean against the wall, a woman kisses Dante's forehead, walks away, and heads toward the back. Dante watches her leave, looks ahead dreamily, half-spinning in his chair, and then explodes in jubilance. Randal enters carrying videos, Dante hands him the summons, and Randal reads it. The cooler door is heard opening, Dante and Randal regard her curiously as she looks very satisfied. Caitlin walks lazily down the convenience store aisle, joins them, and latches onto Dante's arm lovingly. Randal and Dante stare at Caitlin, confused, and everyone is silent. The same old man who took a porn magazine to the bathroom is seen with a serene, almost happy face as he lies on a stretcher. The body bag zipper is pulled closed. Dante, the coroner, and Randal stand around the stretcher-bound body bag, midway down which something protrudes, pushing the bag up. The coroner takes notes, Randal stares at it, and ambulance attendants join them. The stretcher is wheeled out, the coroner stares at Dante, and Randal and the coroner stare in disbelief. Randal looks down, Dante and Randal stare at the floor, Dante says nothing, and then says even less than nothing. Randal hops off the freezer case, steps out of frame, exits, comes back, and Dante crosses out of frame. Dante repairs ripped dollar bills, taping them back together. Jay enters with Silent Bob, claps his hands, and exits, leaving Silent Bob standing there before he leaves too. Dante shuts his eyes tightly, rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, then suddenly snaps his eyes open. Randal has a heart-to-heart with Veronica, who stares dumbfounded and exits. Dante lies on the floor alone, Randal exits and locks the door behind him. Randal steps inside, hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame. Dante throttles Randal, choking him to the ground. Randal throws his fists into Dante's midriff, sending him back into the magazine rack. Randal jumps to his feet as Dante comes at him again, tumbles into the cakes with Entenman's products scattering beneath and around him. He grabs a pound cake and hits Dante in the head with it, using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. Randal grabs Italian bread and smacks it into Dante's face as he rushes him blindly.",
    "731": "Below the sky along the horizon, lifeboats row toward a waiting ship anchored amid floating icebergs. Rose opens her eyes as they row up alongside the ship Carpathia. Later, Titanic survivors recover on one of the ship's lower decks as nurses and crewmen flit amongst them. Still dressed in a tuxedo, Cal walks down a staircase onto the lower deck. Cal brushes past a man and walks into the survivors. Rose sits on a bench with a blanket wrapped around her, hooding her hair and head. She glances up at Cal's back as he surveys the passengers. Rose looks away as he turns toward her. She closes her eyes as Cal paces behind her. Rose peers sideways at Cal as he walks away. Her hair wet and stringy, Rose stands in pouring rain on the deck of the ship. She stares up at the Statue of Liberty, the torch and crown glowing in the night. A ship's crewman holding a clipboard steps up to Rose. Rose continues to stare up at the giant statue as the crewman moves on. On the ocean floor, the two submersibles shine their lights on the Titanic's remains. The submersibles rise, leaving the wreck and darkness. At the surface, crewmen work to recover the submersibles. Standing with Lizzy on the research, Brock sniffs a cigar, then throws it into the water. Staring at Brock, Lizzy smiles and shakes her head. He turns and watches lights glint off the surface of rolling waves. Later that night, wearing only a nightgown, across the desolate deck, her loose white hair blows in the wind. Clutching her hands over her heart, Rose walks to a railing at the back of the ship. She grips the railing with one hand, and then pulls herself up onto the bottom rung. She stares down into the water. She unclasps her left hand, revealing the Heart of the Ocean. The large heart-shaped blue diamond glints in the moonlight. On the deck of the Carpathia, young Rose stands in the rain and stares at the Statue of Liberty. Frowning, she looks down and pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of her jacket pocket. Back on the deck of the Keldysh, Rose tosses the diamond necklace into the sea. As the necklace sinks, Rose smiles and exhales deeply. The necklace twirls down to the dark ocean depths. Later, Rose sleeps in her berth beside her collection of framed photographs. In one picture, Rose stands beside a large fish. In another, she sits on an elephant's back. In a third, Rose wears a long scarf around her neck as she poses beside a biplane. In another, Rose smiles to stride a horse.",
    "735": "He pulls Rose up. Three nearby sailors turn and run toward Jack. Rose grips the railing with her free hand as Jack holds her up and onto the poop deck as Jack wraps his arms around Rose's torso and lifts her back over the rail. Jack falls on top of Rose as she is spilled onto the deck. The sailors run up to them. One sailor glances at Jack and then at Rose's torn dress. Jack stands and places his hands into his trouser pockets. Later, Rose is wrapped in a blanket as men handcuffed Jack. Jack glances at wide eyed Rose. Cal rubs Rose's arms. Cal strides back to Jack. Rose glances at Jack before leaving with Cal. Jack motions over Cal's brown-haired man servant. He steps up to Jack and holds out a cigarette case. Jack takes two cigarettes, placing one in his mouth and the other behind his left ear. Jack looks down at his unlaced boots. Jack looks down as the man walks off. In her berth, Rose sits at a vanity table and holds her silver hand mirror. She sets down the mirror as Cal opens the door. Cal opens a box containing the heart of the ocean. He fastens the necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond on Rose. Rose strokes the necklace as she gazes at her own reflection on the vanity mirror. Cal kneels beside Rose. She stares at him. Cal smiles at the blank-faced Rose who blinks then turns and stares at her reflection. She places her right hand over the diamond. Daytime, Jack and Rose walk along in upper deck. Rose holds out her engagement ring. Rose shakes Jack's hand up and down. She releases his hand and walks away. She stares at him with her mouth open. She snatches Jack's sketchbook. Jack sits beside Rose as she flips through his drawings. She studies a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant. She turns to a drawing of a nude woman lying on her side with a cigarette on her mouth. Another sketch depicts a nude woman standing against a ballet bar. Rose closes the sketchbook as another passenger walks past. Smiling, Rose turns to his sketch of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched over her head. Another drawing of just a pair of hands. Rose looks down open-mouth as Jack flip to another drawing. A fully-clothed middle-aged woman. Rose smiles at Jack. Her smile fades. In a dining room, Ruth sips tea with two other women. Ruth nods at Molly then strides off. Nearby mustached Ismay sits with the captain. Jack takes Rose's hand. He pulled her to a different section of the railing. Jack spits.",
    "737": "The waiter spoons a dollop of black caviar into Jack's dinner plate. Rose smiles and Jack grins at her. Molly glares at Ruth as the waiter refills Jack's glass. Jack tosses a box of matches to Cal. Rose raises her glass and they all toast. Jack raises his glass to Rose and Cal lifts his glass, frowns, and then sips. Later, a waiter pushes a cart laden with desserts. Jack hands a pen to Molly and Cal lobs the matches back to Jack. He slips them into his pocket, then approaches Rose. Rose smiles as Ruth stares at them. Kissing her hand, Jack slips a note to Rose. He turns and walks off, glancing back at her over his shoulder. As Ruth stares at her daughter, Rose gazes across the room toward the door. Beneath the skylight, Jack stands on the landing and faces the clock. Rose steps to the bottom of the staircase and, lifting her dress slightly, she ascends the stairs. Jack turns. Another play is a set of pipes. Two men swing each other around on the platform as couples dance. Fabrizio dances with a blonde woman, Helga. He places his hand on her back. Jack, now with his tie removed and sleeves rolled up, dances with Cora, a little girl with dark hair. Some people clap their hands in time to the music. Rose sits at a table with blonde Bjorn as Tommy sets down several glasses of beer. Tommy sets a beer in front of Rose. Rose claps her hands as she watches Jack. Nearby, a man falls to the floor. Two other men help him up, while another hands the man his drink. Jack spins Cora as Fabrizio and Helga prance back and forth. He waves Rose over. They stand on the dance floor and Jack pulls Rose close. Cora stands watching them and smiles. Jack and Rose dance through the crowd. Fabrizio and Helga climb onto the platform, then dance. Jack and Rose whirl around. Jack pulls arm of the rose and then performs a special dance. Watching him, Rose pulls off her shoes, tosses them to a nearby woman, then holds up the hem of her dress. Jack smiles, claps his hands. When he stops, Rose dances. They link arms and dance in a circle. Other couples dance around them. Jack and Rose hold hands, then face each other and spin faster and faster. In the smoking room, a steward lights Cal's cigar. Others talk or smoke cigars. Tommy and Bjorn arm wrestle as others cheer. Jack steps up to their table and, reaching over Bjorn, grabs two glasses of beer. He hands one glass to Rose, then drinks from his own. Jack watches Rose gulp down most of her beer.",
    "746": "At the Holbrooks', Hilly, with her hair in curling clips, scowls at the newspaper. Her eyes shoot up at Yule Mae who is clearing away some dishes. Yule Mae goes towards the kitchen, then stops and puts the plates back down. William and Hilly both lower their newspapers. William glances at his watch, pecks his wife on the cheek and goes. Yule Mae picks up the plates. With a supercilious smile, Hilly picks up her paper. Chubby faced Sugar who towers above Minnie listens obediently. Sugar gets on the bus leaving Minnie behind. Minnie gets on another bus. He deposits her outside a set of gates and a long drive beyond. Minnie walks up the drive towards an imposing white painted mansion. Celia bursts barefoot through the door with a cheery wave. Minnie walks towards her. Long and slender Celia puts on her stilettos in the hall. Minnie points to a mark on Celia's cheek. She drags Minnie into the state-of-the-art kitchen. Minnie looks at the messy kitchen table. Celia coyly touches her slender waist. Minnie shrugs a yes. Celia hugs her. She ushers Minnie into the house, swigging from a bottle of cola. Celia sinks down on a chair like a naughty child. She swigs some more Coke. At the Holbrooks', Hilly is addressing a meeting of the junior league. Skeeter is sitting near the back. Hilly dismisses Mary Beth with a wave of her hand. Skeeter sits back down with a blind smile. Later, Skeeter pulls up outside Brent's Drug Store Diner and hurries in carrying her briefcase. Elizabeth and Hilly are already sitting in a booth. With a knowing smile Hilly commands Elizabeth to budge up. Elizabeth slides a milkshake in front of Skeeter. Hilly's face softens. Hilly and Elizabeth smile conspiratorially. Skeeter gives Hilly a long look. She forces a smile at Elizabeth's enthusiasm. At Hilly's the front lawn is being mowed and Yule Mae is hoovering. She goes to move the sofa away from the wall. Spotting something she reaches down. It's a ring. She looks about her catching her breath and slips it into the pocket of her white apron. At Elizabeth's, Aibileen lays Mae Mobley down to change her nappy. As she unpins the nappy, her face stiffens with displeasure. In her kitchen, she sits facing Skeeter. She fixes Skeeter with a determined expression. Minnie barges in. Seeing Skeeter she puts her hands on her ample hips. Outside she starts to stride away from Aibileen's house, then stops and walks right back inside. Skeeter obediently moves back her chair. Skeeter gawks nervously as Minnie heaves her full round hips onto the table and folds her arms. Skeeter whips off her specs.",
    "756": "David reaches for something, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it. Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool. David struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge. The pole slides away, and David hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it. The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him. The pole is lying on the ground between them. David stands and looks at them. Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face. David closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand. The man tears at the choking arm, and slams David back into the bedroom wall. David's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall. The man tries to throw him off, but David squeezes his throat relentlessly. The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat. He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting David, still trying to throw him off. They reel across the room and he smashes David into the wall again. He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees. He rises off balance and David drags him back down. He sinks to the floor and David tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck. David throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless. David crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists. When they are free, her arms flop down. David steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting. He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her. David gently opens a closet door. Audrey's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs. She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as David carries her up the staircase. She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him. He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.",
    "758": "David's eyes open. Outside, the greenery is becoming a blur as the train is moving faster, shaking more than it did. He watches through the window, then glances across the aisle. A man reading a book closes it and, like the woman beside him, begins to stare out of the window as the train begins to shake more violently. David looks up ahead and, between the seats, sees another passenger's hand reaching down to grab hold of an armrest. Meanwhile, a car is driving down a quiet urban street. In a living room, a boy lies over a sofa, his feet over the back, his head hanging down to the floor, flicking through TV channels with the remote, upside down. David slowly swings his legs over the side of a hospital trolley and sits up. In front of him, a white bandaged figure is lying on another trolley. Dressed only in his shirt and trousers, David looks around uncertainly. A white coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards David and is replaced by other medical staff. He holds up a torch and examines David's eyes. David stares at the other trolley. They both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly. Still staring at the other figure, David slowly shakes his head. David shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger. David nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads. The other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages. David walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling. His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him. David hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy. They stare at each other. She moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair. He puts his arm around her, gazing past her. She steps back, looks at David, then at the boy, her head on one side. The boy's lips move. The three of them stand silently for a moment. Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor. As his parents follow, they let go of each other's hands. A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor. Flashlights go off as David's family steps out in the open air.",
    "767": "Lily wears her winter hat as the whole family group stares at one another and then forms a group hug. Gordon watches from the steps, grasping onto the handrails. They fly over mountains, and as the plane approaches to land, Jackson and Yuri stand behind the others while Sasha struggles with the controls to keep the aircraft level. As the plane skims the ground, Jackson and Yuri join the others, and in the cargo hold, the two families run to a Bentley. Jackson unbuckles it, and they all climb inside. Gordon heaves a lever, and the cargo door opens. Gordon turns and heads for the steps as the plane thumps against the ground. Reaching the cargo hold, Gordon sprints between the rows of cars towards the open rear door. Jackson inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, turns the key, puts the car into gear, and accelerates towards the cargo exit. It shoots down the ramp and bumps onto the glacier. As the plane continues landing, the cars are tossed out of the cargo door, and the Bentley's airbags deploy. Sasha gets the plane on the ground, crosses himself, closes his eyes, and then opens them as it comes to a stop perilously close to the drop. Sasha breathes in, then grins, but the grin vanishes as the plane starts to go down in a steep incline, rapidly gaining speed. It falls into an abyss and explodes. Watching from up above, Tamara sobs. Jackson looks skywards when he hears a helicopter. A fleet of helicopters carries wild animals in suspended harnesses. The group on the ground stares, and then Gordon starts to wave. The Chinese crewmen on the helicopter see the group down below. The helicopter lands, and a man in uniform rushes out to them. Yuri and the twins step forward, but Tamara is stopped. The boys, Yuri and Popi, are on board the helicopter with the crew. The helicopter speeds over mountains as the morning sun throws light on the summits. David and Laura sit together as the helicopters make their way to the complex built deep into the mountains. They approach the complex, and the landing area bustles with people. Hearing the corgis, Professor West turns and sees the Queen, struggling with her leads and holding onto her hat. A bus zooms Anheuser and his group through the mountain on an elevated track. There are massive structures to the left with work going on the various arks. Yuri is at the R3 Boarding gate, and Gordon walks with Tamara. They all stop when Lily spots light. They run down to a truck on the road, and Jackson lobs a stone at the vanishing truck as grandma in the back hears it.",
    "773": "He reports into a walkie-talkie on the activity by the basin. Long-hair Charlie scarfs a pickle. Jackson sits in the passenger seat of an army jeep, the kids in the back. Soldiers crouch behind him. They arrive at a busy research facility. Jackson smooths back his black hair. In an office with Professor West, Adrienne talks to Satnam via the Internet. He takes note of the great expression worn by Satnam and West. Mouth agape, Adrienne straightens away from the computer screen. Wide-eyed Adrienne frowns. He looks out of the window and spots Jackson knocking about with Lily and Noah. He watches as Jackson lifts up Lily. Adrienne looks around furtively at West who sits behind him. Satnam disconnects and turns to his wife Aponna. He kneels by his son, Ajeet. At Yellowstone, Charlie spies on Jackson and the kids. Nightfall arrives. Adrienne climbs onboard a helicopter. In his darkened office at the White House, Anheuser hangs up the phone and looks out of the French windows. At the campsite in Yellowstone, Jackson watches the chopper fly overhead. He brings up Google Maps to show Yellowstone on his laptop. In the tent, Noah swats a bug. Jackson spots Noah sending a text on a cell phone and takes it from him. Noah zips the door closed on Jackson. Jackson sits back and reads the text. Jackson sits in his limo typing on his laptop. He spots Charlie nearby broadcasting from an RV. Newspaper clippings are seen. Charlie, who has a beard darker than his long, straggly hair, looks around furtively then leans in close. Jackson frowns dubiously then nods calmly. Gordon hugs Kate in a supermarket. She smirks. A crack appears in the car park outside. It rumbles beneath a car. The crack opens approaching another car. In the supermarket, he finds it nearby and hands it to her. At the checkout, a customer's trolley rolls slowly away. A crack appears on the supermarket floor. Cereal boxes shake as Kate reaches out for them. A large crack tears through the floor between them. At Yellowstone, Lily scratches. Noah looks gravely at Jackson. Anheuser follows Wilson into the White House situation room. A well-dressed, middle-aged man approaches the boxes corner of the ring. The fight begins. Sitting by a glamorous, young, blonde Tamara, Uri looks at his mobile. He presses his thumb to the screen to confirm his identity. Uri looks up blankly and then stands and is out of the arena checking his watch as he goes. Tamara stands and calls after him. Sultan spots Uri leaving. A massive hit on Sultan and he runs to the canvas. Jackson drives the kids in the limo. The kids fall asleep in the back seat.",
    "774": "Jackson pulls up outside Kate's house in the early morning dew and climbs out of the limo to open the back door. Kate comes outside and they hug. Jackson watches by the limo as Gordon comes outside, then smiles and waves to Lily as she goes inside. Kate turns and, after Jackson holds his phone up, goes indoors. Jackson gets back into the limo and changes into a chauffeur's uniform. Meanwhile, Tamara looks fondly at her little Pekingese dog, Caesar. Jackson pulls up on the driveway outside Yuri's palatial mansion in Bel Air, where curly-haired twin boys Alec and Oleg wait on the steps, both checking their watches. Jackson takes their luggage over to the boot and pulls up on the runway at Santa Monica Airport, jumping out as Yuri's pilot Sasha marches over. A case hits Alec's foot and Oleg glares over his shoulder as he boards the waiting plane. Jackson gets in the limo and switches on the radio. Back at the house, Gordon watches TV over breakfast as the whole house shakes violently. Gordon, Kate, and the kids climb under the table, and on the TV, the press conference is similarly affected. Jackson pulls up outside and heads indoors as the house rocks unpredictably and collapses. They board the limo as the trees fall off ahead of them. Jackson reverses the limo, and the back door is knocked off. He bumps into a Porsche, which falls into an earthquake, and Gordon is slightly pissed. Jackson sets off at high speed as the street falls to pieces, and the creek off the road rears up savagely behind them. Kate, in the back seat, holds Lily as the collapsing road rushes out to them. Two old ladies driving steadily ahead of them, Jackson powers through gardens. The old lady powers into a rising section of the road and the limo soars over a gap. Buildings have obliterated all around them, and sewage throws on the windscreen. A giant donut rolls across the road, and the race freeway breaks in half. A missed truck smashes into a petrol station and explodes. They drive alongside the collapsing bridge, and cars fall from the freeway, smashing into the road around the limo. They approach a huge gap, and Jackson spins the limo into a tyre hole and accelerates over pass beneath the freeway. Jackson drives the limo into a ramp and drives in the collapsing buildings ground floor. A high rise falls on the road, and the limo smashes out of the other side. In the corridor of the Whitehouse, in the airport the pilot lies dead near the petrol station. Jackson’s limo pulls up, and he grabs his case from the limo. A giant fissure hole causes havoc and destruction as it arrows towards the airport, and the runway starts to collapse.",

Nema's grandma steadies a chicken. Grandma chops the chicken's head off. Yuri sits apart staring at a photograph of his ex-wife and the twins. Jackson joins him. He hands him a flight jacket. It is a winter hat. Yuri glances at the women. Jackson nods and raises his eyebrows. Gordon peers down the cockpit. Gordon descends steps in the Antinov. He points his thumb upstairs. Gordon climbs back up. Jackson and Yuri join him and Sasha in the cockpit. Through smoke and clouds they see fire and mountain lava. Hawaii is devastated. The Antonov flies over the city as skyscrapers collapse and burn. On Air Force One, he enters the Presidential cabin. She looks away from him. Nora smiles and nods. Night, a phone rings on the desk. A child opens a bedroom door, and a girl in slippers trots across floorboards. The child picks up the receiver. Tony is calling from the ship. Tony has a hand over one ear. Her father and mother sit up in bed as the daughter runs into their room. Husband and wife exchange glances. Tony studies her photograph and fights back tears. His son picks up the receiver and studies it. Then looks back across the room to where his Japanese wife stands with her arms on the child's shoulders. The room begins to shake. Tony hears the screams before the line goes dead. He hangs up. Tony glances away. Washington. President Wilson walks through crowds outside the White House. Ash falls like snow. The injured are being treated beside ambulances. Wilson enters the West Wing. His clothes are covered in ash. People stare at him. A fireman touches the brim of his hat. A female paramedic jumps to her feet to salute him. He acknowledges her salute then crosses to a woman with a small girl. Behind the woman is a couch. His secretary runs over. Outside the ash continues to fall as crowds mill around. The medic looks up. Everyone looks around. Now violently shakes the ground. Patients are being treated on gurneys that are alarmed. It splits open. The president clinging to a drip stand, fixes his eyes on the tall pointed Washington monument. It sways and starts to fall like a felled tree. On Air Force One, all eyes turn to Laura. Adrian watches Anheuser. At Saint Peter's in Rome, the Pope leads the prayers of the faithful gathered in the square. The Cardinals gathered inside look up at the great painted ceiling of the Sistine Chapel as it begins to crack. Great cracks appear in the walls and the ceiling gives way.",
    "779": "Outside, the crowd panics as the amazing edifice of Saint Peter's, with its huge dome, keels forward and crashes into the square. On Air Force One, Scotty studies a screen showing a projective tsunami spread across the oceans of the world. Meanwhile, a boat remains upright on the turbulent ocean. Elsewhere, Adrian's father Harry plays the piano and drinks. Kearney and others watch TV in the galley when Harry enters. Tony, dazed, gets to his feet and wanders aimlessly towards him. The trolley with the television on it starts to roll, as do other filled trolleys around. The ship vibrates. Harry moves towards a door and hangs onto a handle. Tony clings to a table as the ship starts listing, but the table is torn away and personnel slide down the slope. Tony loses his grasp on the table and slithers along the floor away from Harry, who is still clinging to the hammock. Harry pulls himself out onto the deck as the ship lists behind him until he faces the black night sky. The ship keels over to the starboard side then completes a hundred and eighty degree turn. The waves wash off. In Washington, a white sheet flutters in the breeze and a wheel turns with not much movement elsewhere. President Wilson looks up as he hears the noise of water. The water up the tarmac, swelled by the onrush from Chesapeake Bay, thunders towards the city. A wave brings a large aircraft carrier and buries the White House. On the Antinov, Jackson fiddles with a radio on one of the cars in the loading bay. Kate, in a parka, wanders over to him, opens the passenger door, and settles down beside him. He glances at her, then turns to look at the radio again. She gazes out of the windscreen, watches him, then turns her head away, taking her hand up to her cheek. He blinks, inclines his head, and stares at the radio. On Air Force One, Anheuser walks over to the screen, and they turn to Professor West. In the Antinov cockpit, Jackson and Yuri climb down the steps, leaving Gordon in the cockpit with Sasha. In the cargo hold, Jackson hands Yuri life jackets. Jackson leans on the steps and looks across at his sleeping family. Still standing by the steps, Jackson wearily removes a life jacket from its container. As he does so, his son Noah wakes and looks over at him. Jackson, taken by surprise, stares at Noah. Jackson lowers his gaze and nods. Father and son both nod and hug. Kate wakes. The Karpovs put on the life jackets. The plane descends rapidly. Both the Curtis children have their life jackets on.",
    "783": "Kevin slips in as another resident comes out. Jane is in the kitchen; she puts down the cup she's washing and goes to the door, seeing Kevin through the peephole. She looks exasperated. Kevin, eyes closed, hopes he hasn't gone too far and talks into a dictaphone. His jaw drops in astonishment as he spots the closet full of dresses. Jane rushes after him, barging him out of the way to close the closet doors, then strides off to put on the shiny dark green dress. Kevin shakes his head in disbelief and takes a photo of the closet. Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously and pulls out a yellow dress with pleats and orange flowers. At the wedding, one bridesmaid falls over. Next, Jane tries on a twirly orange number, a Japanese style kimono. They bow to each other and Kevin takes a photo. Jane crouches down to be the same height as the Japanese bridesmaids. She tries on a variety of dresses: one with long black gloves and even a man's evening suit, does a high-stepping routine with a top hat and sashays in pink floral print, a bright one like yellow and pink candy floss. Kevin gets caught up in a white skirt like a giant snowflake, with dazzling yellow. The wedding is on a lawn overlooking the ocean. The bridesmaids wear tiny pink strapless mini-dresses. Jane poses with the heavily made up bride and a much older, open-shirted groom. She poses in gauzy red, shiny candy pink and flowery baby blue as Kevin lounges on the couch taking pictures. He finds a cowboy hat with a red flower on the brim. At that wedding, Jane is on a horse that ends up facing the wrong way for the photo. He finds a pair of flippers. At the underwater wedding, Jane smiles in floral bathing cap as the bride and groom share a watery kiss. He reaches for the dictaphone. He looks awkward at catching her off guard, looking sad and vulnerable. They sit opposite one another, squirming in uncomfortable silence. Later, Jane, still looking unhappy, hangs the dresses back in the closet. On a sunny day, Jane arrives at Tess' apartment. Jane becomes suspicious as Tess stands blocking the doorway. Pedro is vacuuming and dancing. Jane looks appalled. Kevin is at work and watches Maureen walk off, shaking his head. Later, he and Jane are scanning the bar codes on items for the wedding list. He scans some china penguins. She looks mortified. He grins and brandishes the scanner. High above the busy streets at the New York Journal, Kevin approaches Maureen's office. He looks horrified. Jane hurries to meet George on the terrace of the boat house. Back at the paper, Kevin picks up the phone.",
    "787": "Marcus looks incredulously at Willie who drags on a fag in a boxing ring. He's talking to the kid, and Marcus is his opponent. Marcus looks him over, then the kid steps forward and kicks Marcus in the crotch, doubling him up. Marcus punches the kid low and then whacks Willie in the balls too. The kid hits Marcus in the nuts and all three combatants lie, writhing in agony, on the canvas. Willie turns to the kid and they kick at each other. That night, Grandma has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when Willie and Sue come in, they see her. Granny lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape. They walk a little closer and Willie goes over to her. Sue looks on anxiously as Willie bends over Granny. Willie looks round at Sue, then he holds his hand in front of her mouth then puts his head to her chest to listen for a heartbeat. Granny suddenly comes to. Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor with odd discarded clothes on it. Nearby, Sue lies on her back in her bra and jeans. A bare-chested Willie sits astride her, wearing his jeans and a Santa hat. He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra, then leans forward and kisses her. He kisses his way back down her body and grips her pants between his teeth and pulls on them. As he does so, the kid comes in through the door and hands Willie a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon round it. Mystified, Willie looks at it, then holds up his injured hand. Willie looks moved. Sue props herself up on her elbows and Willie stares at the pickle. Sue smiles and Willie stares at her, then he looks at her and nods to himself. He smiles and shrugs. The next morning, Willie is back in his Santa gear and rooting around in the fridge in the kitchen when the kid runs in. Willie takes the report card, then puts it down and stops buttering toast. Thurman looks down sadly and Willie angrily throws down his knife. Willie is struck dumb and Thurman picks up his report card and heads out of the kitchen. Willie watches him go, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. At night Marcus and Lois sit in the van in the deserted mall car park watching the staff entrance. They see Gin come out and watch as Gin gets in his big Chevrolet car and drives off. Gin drives down a deserted unlit road. Up ahead he sees a light swinging from side to side.The vans up the road side.",
    "793": "Willie lobs a bottle over his shoulder, smashing it on a Mercedes windscreen, then ambles after Marcus towards a mall where a manager deals with an irritated Santa. Harrison sees Willie and Marcus, gazing lustfully after someone through his cigarette smoke. Marcus winces and shoves Willie. In an office, Bob sits with a black guy taking a large drag on a cigarette, while a security chief eyes Bob and peels an orange. Down in front of the grotto, Marcus works a crowd of kids, with Santa's chair conspicuously empty. Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper, rolls his eyes, shakes his head, then turns back to the kids. Marcus goes backstage, finding Santa comatose, and wakes him roughly. Santa swigs his grog as Marcus goes out front where kids are lined up. Inside the grotto, a fat kid with an ice cream takes a deep breath and sneezes over Santa. A small girl sits on snotty Santa's knee, followed by a boy with long hair. Santa shoos the boy away and looks over at Marcus. A bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skater kids. A fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off, tries to look dignified, and walks on despite a skater throwing a tin that bounces off his hand. The fat boy waddles towards the mall and enters the grotto, where Santa impatiently munches nuts. Marcus leads the fat boy over to surly Santa, and he sits on Santa's knee, staring at him with boogies dangling from his nose, then pulls Santa's beard. At the end of the day, the fat boy is sitting in the car park outside the mall as Willie and Marcus come out. Willie gives Marcus the finger as he walks away across the car park, and the fat boy watches him go. Still in his Santa suit, Willie sits alone at the counter in a bar, lights a cigarette, chews some gum, and looks resentfully around the bar at festive social drinkers. He drags on his cigarette and sees a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy giving him the evil eye across the bar. Willie stares back, and the Indian guy keeps his malevolent gaze on Willie before looking away. The barmaid comes over, sniffs his empty glass, refills it, and gives him a sunny smile. Willie knocks back his drink, and the barmaid frowns, then smiles, grins, laughs, and pours out a shot for herself as well as Willie's.",
    "795": "Gin munches on his orange and regards bespectacled Bob, who looks away thoughtfully. That night, Willie drives a seven series BMW in through the gates of the motel. He sees someone with a torch is in his room. He kills the lights of the car. She takes the strawberry blonde wig off and comes over. On the phone. Willie puts his stuff down on a bed and begins taking off his fake snow-covered boots. He gets off the bed and goes over to a wardrobe. The kid watches Willie in the bath. The kid blinks a couple of times. Willie lies in bed, the kid hovering at the bedside. The next morning, Willie is still asleep in bed. The kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie surfaces from his slumber. He sits up and takes the glass. He gives the kid a look and puts the glass down. The kid climbs on to the bed. He settles beside Willie and opens the relevant door on the calendar, then reads what's written on the back of the door. The kid gives a doubtful looking Willie the door. He knocks the chocolate out of the calendar. He does and turns to Willie. The kid gets off the bed. Willie looks dubiously at the door off the calendar. At lunchtime, he is eating with Marcus and his oriental girlfriend, Lois, at a restaurant in the mall. Marcus regards him with thinly-veiled contempt. Willie masticates a massive mouthful of salad and glares vainfully at Marcus. Lois and Marcus head off. A mom and her young son spot Willie in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother looks at Willie expectantly as she holds the hand of the sulky boy by her side. Jimmy's mum scoops him up and hurries away, leaving dear old Santa to his salad. Out in the shops, Lois scrutinizes a swatch of fabric and tries on a pair of designer sunglasses. She moves on and looks over a mink stole with a very critical eye. Having decided it's not too bad, she notes it down on her shopping list. Detecting a possible sale, a saleswoman comes over to her. Again, Gin, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games. Gin turns back to the boy. Back at his new digs, Willie is playing checkers with the kid. The kid moves a piece, keeping his finger on it. Uncertain, he moves it back again. Willie eyes the kid a little impatiently. The kid moves another counter, but still keeps a pudgy finger on it, and looks at Willie, then changes his mind and moves it back. Willie watches as the kid moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the counter.",
    "796": "The kid removes his finger, then, before Willie can move, changes his mind and puts the counter back where it was. Willie struggles to contain his irritation. The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, taking three of Willie's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Willie glares and throws the board in the air. The kid stares placidly at him, unruffled. Willie opens the door to a balding man, who proffers his hand. Willie glances at the kid and the man hands Willie some paperwork. As Grandma nods off in front of the TV, Willie is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub. Still wearing his festive red cap, Willie energetically humps Sue, the barmaid up against the side of the hot tub putting in smokes and foam. Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange. They sit on the sofa together and he hands her her glass. They each take a swig of their respective drinks. She sits back and smiles, then laughs to herself, and he nods off. She looks a little bit disappointed. Later Willie accompanies her to the front door and sees her out. She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step, then heads off into the night. Willie shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kid's advent calendar is lying. He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table, then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside. Calendar ruined, chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge. He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, about a quarter. He belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet. The next morning he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma. The kid's hand is covered in blood. Willie follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap. He pours vodka on the cut, then turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall. Willie looks slightly uneasy, then he spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table. Later that morning, Willie drives the BMW into the deserted car park. Marcus is standing beside a green van waiting for him. They open the back of the van, and Marcus irritably hands Willie an empty Santa sack. Willie shakes his head, then puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box. The gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, Willie and Marcus head for the mall.",
    "797": "Outside a door, a tall, blonde security guard on duty checks his watch. In the back room, Willie puts down a sack and Marcus points to an air conditioning vent. Marcus takes the cover off the vent, clambers into the duct, and clutching a torch, crawls along it. A man in an office looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it. Another woman working at her desk looks up, as does a woman at the next desk. The woman turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and gets on with her work. Marcus arrives at a vent and looks out into a security office full of monitors. He looks at the equipment and makes some notes on a pad. Meanwhile, Gin is having a pedicure and answers his phone. Roger Merriman, the kid's dad, is in prison. Gin walks into the prison visitors room where balding, bespectacled Roger is sitting. Gin nods his head and gets up, leaving Roger looking confused. Willie cooks for the kid and Grandma, serves it up, spoons a dollop onto it, and turns back to the stove to flip the bologna. The kid heads off to get it. Willie serves up a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself and puts it on the breakfast bar. The kid hands it to him, then hands it back to the kid who struggles to open the appropriate door, as if someone might have already opened it and then stuck it back down with a bit too much adhesive. Willie watches out of the corner of his eye as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside. Bob is with Gin, who's mixing himself a dose of Fibracell stool softener. Bob winces as Gin slurps his stool softener and grimaces. The bus pulls up outside the mall and the skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop. The kid sees them and hesitates for a moment, then keeps walking down the street. The skate rats follow close behind him, their interest clearly malicious. They catch him and grope him. The boy wanders off and Santa scratches his own ass. The kid appears, his pants around his armpits. Marcus heads off and Willie looks at the kid, staring incredulously at him for a moment then shakes his head. The kid just stares at him, then walks away still with his underpants up around his armpits. Willie watches him go with a doleful expression, then turns back to Marcus who, for an elf, is staring at him in a very deadpan way. Gin is the next in line. Later, Gin, Willie, and Marcus are in a bar. Marcus shifts uneasily.",
    "798": "Marcus leans forward, then glances at Willie and rubs his chin thoughtfully. Gin gets up from the table and goes, leaving Marcus and Willie regarding each other. Willie resignedly rests his head on his hand while Marcus slips into a brooding silence. The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers has formed at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto. A semi-comatose Santa is on his way as he lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle. Marcus, back in elf guise, is trying to calm the kids. At the top of the escalator, Santa drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, broken bottle still in hand. Marcus shakes his head as Santa makes his way into the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so. In his state of extreme over-refreshment, he keels over and collapses on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents. The kids and moms gasp as Santa rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey. He's falling on his back. He sees a second donkey going over. He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off. He then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a fine display of drunken violence. The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as Gin strides up. Gin drops Willie. Marcus shoves Gin contemptuously in the leg and marches off, dragging Willie away. Later on, Willie is back at the kid's house in the garage. He sits in Roger's BMW with the engine running, having first run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window in order to commit a seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. The kid walks into the garage and sees him. Willie's head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes. The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window. Willie moves slightly. Willie raises his head a little and looks at the kid. The kid turns and makes to go out of the garage. Willie winds the driver's window down and hands the kid a letter. He sees the kid has got a black eye. Later, Willie is smashing into the chief skaterat's face. He turns to the rest of the gang. Two other kids, on bikes, watch astounded as Santa administers the festive beating. Back at the mall, Marcus and Willie are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents. Marcus gets changed out of his elf gear while Willie, in contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.",
    "80": "A trooper knocks the pistol from Ben's lifted hand with a pistol barrel. Ben sinks to his knees as the two men and two others from the front close in on him. He takes in the group with his mouth open. They drive away fast in road dust. Carrying a shopping bag, their mother, Willa, runs up from the background between the children, looking always to cars off-screen. She has a rich body. Pearl comes to her and she picks up Pearl and the doll; John, laden with his oath, walks quickly into the house. Willa does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars off-screen. Ben lies on his back, chuckling and murmuring indistinctly in his sleep. Ben lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of Preacher stretches down into the shot, upside down, snake-like. Ben wakes, sees Preacher, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls from bunk to floor. Preacher collects himself into a squat, nursing his face. Ben sits up in bed. He picks up and wads a sock. Preacher gets and pockets the knife. They rest on the sill of the cell window, the lettered fingers legible. The right hand is lettered L-O-V-E. The hands open, disclosing his open knife. They close over it. His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward. Moonlight on his face. He prays, quietly. Same shot as before, but now, prison lights are on; and a man, a prison guard, waits close inside the door. Bart the Hangman joins him with a silent salute. Bart wears a hard derby. They walk in silence into medium, moving shot, the guard talkative, Bart reluctant to talk. The Penitentiary recedes in the background. On porch, by door, is a doll's perambulator. Bart and guard walk into the shot. Guard stops, Bart starts up his front steps. The guard leaves the shot; Bart goes in. He hangs up his coat and hat. Across this his wife speaks off-screen; a lighted door is ajar at rear of hall. He looks past her, and we see two small children asleep in a big brass bed. Bart registers, turns again to the basin, and we pan them back into the original two-shot. His wife's eyes go sharp and quiet. Bart rinses his hands. A sigh; he takes up the towel. He looks at her a moment. Towards his children. He goes into their room on tiptoe. He approaches his children, across whose bed we shoot without yet seeing them. He comes into medium close-up. As he leans and we tilt down, he extends his large hands. Two rose-and-gold little girls lie in sleep; Bart's hands enter the shot and gently rearrange the covers so that their mouths and throats are free.",
    "800": "Al-Saleem sits with a cigarette burning in an ashtray beside him, slotting a SIM card into a mobile phone and replacing the battery. He has a drag on the cigarette, dials a number on the phone, takes another drag, and slowly raises the phone to his ear. A surveillance view shows the city. In a park, Hoffman calls Ferris, who's walking through an airport terminal. On a residential street, Ferris and Skip get out of an SUV and communicate through earpieces. Sadiki emerges from an apartment building and Ferris follows him to his car, watched by men in a white four-by-four. The four-by-four drives at them and Sadiki gets in his car. Ferris smashes a window as Sadiki drives away. Ferris and the attackers exchange fire. An agent drives the SUV after the four-by-four but crashes, throwing Skip through the windscreen. Ferris keeps shooting as the attackers drive off after Sadiki. Skip lies on the ground covered in blood and Ferris feels for a pulse in his neck, then makes a call on his mobile. Sadiki sits on a chair in a shabby room with a man filming him. Al-Saleem's lieutenant pours a drink, hands it to Sadiki, and looks at him curiously. In another room, Al-Saleem watches the video footage of Sadiki on a small screen. Outside the city, a group of boys stand on a hillside with dogs mooching about further down. Sadiki lies dead amongst piles of rubbish. Skip lies unconscious in a hospital bed with a breathing tube in his throat and Ferris stands by the bed, staring at him. Ferris swigs from a bottle of soda, picks up a phone, and sits by a window. Sitting on a terrace by a lake, Hoffman pulls out his earpiece and sighs. Ferris walks into his apartment, steps on an envelope, picks it up, and shuts the door. He walks into the living room, puts his keys on the table, and opens the envelope. He takes out a photograph of him and Aisha walking down a street, stares at the photo, and looks around anxiously. Then, he picks up a bowl, hurls it at the wall, and storms out of the apartment. Aggressively driving through town, he calls Aisha on his mobile. A mobile on a table in Aisha's apartment rings. Ferris speeds along a street and stops, gets out, and runs across the street. He holds out his hand and the car stops. Ferris slaps the bonnet and runs to Aisha's apartment building, heading up the stairs with his phone pressed to his ear. He slows up as he approaches a gate.",
    "810": "They all sit at the table and Cala serves food. Ferris looks at the boys and Rowley shakes his head gravely. Ferris looks to the boys again and Yousef nods in approval of the next dish. Aisha notices and Cala looks at the boys and points. Aisha looks at Cala, worried, and she waves a white napkin. He smiles and raises his eyebrows at Aisha. They walk out to the street and he holds out his hand. Aisha smiles and looks up to a window, where Cala is looking down at them. Ferris waves to her but without shaking hands, Ferris goes. Aisha wrings her hands as she looks up at people leaning out of windows, watching her. Hani gives Ferris photographs of Al-Masri and Sadiki with young women in a club and Hani lights a cigar. Ferris frowns earnestly and Hani looks at a grandfather clock. Ferris's eyes dart and he smiles and holds up the file of photographs. Garland works on a computer and Garland stretches his arms above his head. At the military airbase, a chopper lands in front of a hangar. Pale light glows in the windows of the hangar and casts a sheen across the tarmac. A troop carrier drives up and soldiers lift bodies in body bags from the chopper and load them onto the troop carrier. Ferris walks along past an airport terminal building, talking on his phone. Skip's by an SUV in arrivals. A soldier detonates a bomb. Al-Saleem watches a news report with one of his men and Ferris, Hani and Garland are also watching. Garland sends the message in Arabic and Ferris pulls out his earpiece. Al-Saleem sits on a balcony and his lieutenant walks over with a laptop. He sits and opens the laptop, which displays a picture of Sadiki. Al-Saleem looks at the picture and Al-Saleem studies the photo and narrows his eyes. In his office, Sadiki shows a model to three men. A colleague calls over and Sadiki goes to a computer and opens his mail. Emails flood across the screen and he frowns as he starts to read the messages. Below the message is a photograph of someone wearing a balaclava and the next has a picture of someone holding up the Koran. Sadiki looks at a TV which plays news footage of the bombing. Increasingly alarmed, he takes off his glasses. Carrying a case and laptop, Sadiki rushes out of the building and he walks out onto the street. He stops and looks round anxiously. Then he walks over to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm as he goes. He walks round to the driver's door and he unlocks it. He opens it and gets in. He frantically turns the key in the ignition and he switches on the headlights. A group of men wander past, watching. He drives away in his cream Mercedes.",
    "818": "She is handed a bouquet and hurries after the other maids of honor. Suze's father goes to take his daughter's arm. Rebecca turns around and runs into Suze's open arms. Grinning happily, Rebecca races down the aisle to join the other three, who are processing slowly towards the altar. Her black hair pinned up in an elegant bun, Suze composes herself and looks towards the altar, at Tarquin's smiling face. After the wedding, Rebecca and the rest of the guests wave as the newlyweds are driven off in a white Rolls Royce. Rebecca, standing among the well-dressed crowd in her spotted shrug, smiles fondly. As the people begin to disperse, her face starts to cloud over, as if suddenly thinking of something sad and serious along with the good things. She turns away from the church and starts walking across a city street in her pink bridesmaid dress, with a heavy tulle petticoat and long, white gloves. She walks past the window of Yves St. Laurent. A black China mannequin knocks on the window. Rebecca lifts the hem of her pink dress and considers. A second mannequin knocks on the glass and shows her the orange bag she's carrying. Rebecca compares it to her pink one. The mannequin jiggles the bag seductively. Rebecca's eyes fill with wonder. She smiles eagerly. But then, with a little shake of the head, she walks on. The two doll-like mannequins look at each other. The seated one with the bag stands up. Both clap their hands. The mannequins in all the fashion windows she passes applaud her. Rebecca starts to laugh, swinging her skirt joyfully, then stops in her tracks. Luke is standing in front of her in the middle of the pavement. She looks at him like a kid who's been caught stealing sweets. She shrugs inanely. She steps towards him. He steps towards her. They're in front of Asprey's. She shakes her head hopelessly as he looks intently into her face. A faint smile flickers across his lips. Reaching into his coat pocket, he brings out the green scarf. He wraps the scarf around her neck. Rebecca beams at him. He kisses her on the lips. As they kiss, a pair of ankle boots is placed in a window display. Rebecca spots them in the corner of her eye. A tall, white-faced mannequin tilts her head and winks at her. Rebecca grins and goes back to giving Luke's kiss her full attention. The screen fades to black, leaving just the green scarf. She introduces Alicia to Janne. Janne kisses Alicia's hand. She dances with Luke. Luke spots Graham throwing himself about to the music. Graham lies on his back. Jane turns his legs like a wheel.",
    "836": "Diana plugs a flash drive into the credit card burner. Meanwhile, Sandy logs into the network on the records computer and opens the folder. In his office area, Ken stares off with a furrowed brow, then sits at his computer and logs into company records. Diana enters Cornish's information into a card burner and inserts a blank card. On Ken's computer, he sees Cornish's actual photo and quickly stands. The burner finishes processing and prints out the card, which Diana hands to Sandy with a smile. He eyes the card as Ken swiftly moves through the offices and approaches the records room doors. He inputs the code and they slide open. As he quickly enters, Ken finds the room vacant and steps toward the computer with wide eyes. Now, Sandy and Diana exit the building through an unmarked alley door. She grabs the card and they enter an upscale hotel lobby, approaching reception. Meanwhile, in their silver sedan, Julian and Marisol speed across a bridge into St. Louis. As Diana follows Sandy into the luxury suite, her mouth falls open. She grabs a grape from a fruit platter as Sandy, loosening his tie, enters a room and removes his suit coat. He tosses it onto a chair and flops back on the bed. Now, in a frothy bubble bath, Diana blows a handful of suds and finishes off a large bottle of champagne as Sandy sleeps in the same outstretched position. Glancing around, she lowers the gushing shower head beneath the frothy surface, slaps the side of the tub, and her foot jolts out of the water. Now, Trish speaks on her phone as Diana enters in a robe. Later, in a salon, Diana gently applies lavender eye makeup to her already smoothed eyelids. Three stylists watch as she moves around the sampling table and grabs a can of hair spray. Diana shakes the can, sniffs it, then sprays her hair, dousing her entire mop of hair. She shakes her messy hair around, then faces the mirror, surrounding her head in a cloud of hairspray. Looking up, she spots the giggling stylists, who abruptly stop and look away. Diana blinks rapidly and shifts in place, then turns toward the checkout counter with an armful of products. Striding forward, she stops and lowers her gaze, then slowly turns around and approaches the stylists with her lips pressed together. The male stylist steps forward and Diana sits down as he spins her toward the mirror. Now, in the swanky hotel restaurant, Sandy slouches alone at the bar with a glass of water. Sitting up, he glances around the room, then takes a sip. Wearing a chic black dress, Diana rounds the corner in slow motion, stepping forward with her auburn hair straightened and makeup beautifully applied.",
    "84": "We bring in the bottom of the stairs. JOHN gasps, peering, and looks up. PREACHER looks at JOHN; JOHN sinks onto the edge of a chair. PREACHER sits opposite. A bar of light from the door falls across PREACHER'S face. From JOHN, just a questioning helpless reaction. JOHN is still. He gawks at his own folly, covers his mouth with his hand and looks up at PREACHER, stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly. JOHN starts for the stairs. It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with a receding engine sound off-screen, disclosing: ICEY'S skirts in the background. They are awfully spic-and-span; they even wear shoes. They wave after the car, bewilderedly. She hustles out of shot. His hand clamps over her mouth. She struggles and whimpers. His hand comes up; she puts out her own, expecting a loving hand-clasp; but PREACHER points to the window. Startled, then again tender, she moves to: She adjusts the shade, looking always towards the bed. She smiles maternally. As we PULL BACK and PAN into FULL SHOT OF BED she comes to the bed and sits on the edge and slips off her mules. PREACHER'S back is to her. With a sounding of bedsprings PREACHER turns. His voice is quiet and cold. WILLA puts her face down to the pillow and moans. PREACHER snaps on a harsh bare bulb at the center of the room. She obeys. WILLA hesitates. WILLA walks to meet her image in the mirror; her eyes on. Her head drops, facing the mirror. WILLA is in HEAD CLOSE-UP; bulb hangs at center; PREACHER, in his nightshirt, is beyond it. Her mouth trembles; she can't talk. WILLA just opens her mouth. He stands watching her for a moment; then he snaps off the light and gets into bed. WILLA, in the darkness, does not move. She folds her hands in prayer and lifts her eyes. It lies face down on arbor bricks, its back wide open; money spilling out. A little breeze toys with the money. Then we hear a snipping sound off-screen. TILT UPWARD into. She sits at the end of the grape-arbor. She finishes cutting a skirted paper doll out of a hundred dollar bill and lays it down beside a male hundred-dollar paper-doll. She pats the dolls. PEARL starts guiltily and looks towards him, scrambling money together. JOHN'S footsteps off-screen. As he stoops toward her, dumb with horror. She continues to gather the money together. He stands at the far end of the arbor. PREACHER'S watch-chain gleams. The shot SLOWLY CLOSES DOWN on it and becomes still. We see the paper-dolls blow past him. JOHN starts to laugh uncontrollably. His helpless reaction. He holds out his hands to her; she comes to his lap, dropping her doll at his feet.",
    "841": "The detective leaves while the boss lingers with his arms folded. Sandy gazes at the floor, then rises and watches the men leave. Holding his cell phone, he looks at the salon number displayed in red. He glances up, then down to the number's origin. The detective glances at Daniel, who rubs his face with one hand. Sandy runs off. Sandy's wife helps him pack. Sandy shrugs at his wife. He sets her on the bed. He takes the folded mug shot from his back pocket. She gives him a little nudge. Sandy heads out. He kisses Trish. She hands him his suitcase. A plane sails across the sky. Our view moves over a sunny beach toward a city skyline. Outside Ladies Choice salon, Sandy rolls up his window in a gold Sedan. The plump thief strolls into view in a loud pink print shirt and poofy hair. She walks in slow motion. Sandy observes her go to a tiny blue Fiat with a red stripe on its side. She bounces to the driver's door and gets in. The garishly made-up woman takes a handicapped parking tag off the rear view mirror and tosses it in back. Sandy puts his seat belt on as the woman zips out of her parking space. On a freeway, Sandy tails the thief while she plays with her smartphone. She looks in her rear view and catches sight of him. Setting her phone down, the redhead takes her sunglasses off, looks into the driver's side mirror, and gives her car some gas. Odometer needle rises. Sandy presses his accelerator. The speedometer ticks up to 50. The woman tightens her mouth and slams on the brakes with both feet. The sedan bangs the Fiat's rear bumper. In her rear view, she sees Sandy white-knuckling his wheel. She puts her sunglasses on and primps her hair, then gets out. The short woman looks up at Sandy, then punches his throat. She pushes him and goes for her car. He pulls her hair. She delivers a swift kick to his crotch. Sandy sags as she runs to his car. She gets into his sedan. Sandy limps toward her. She reverses while flipping him off. He shambles back to her Fiat and gets in. He discovers the key missing. In the rear view, he sees an empty road. She comes it through from the sides. The sedan T-bones the compact. She pins it to the guardrail. Sandy tries in vain to open the crushed door as she speeds down the highway. He reaches through the sunroof. He finds a pink registration form in the glove box. He takes it out. He reads the address. In a tiny pink house with a jet ski on the lawn, a variety of small expensive products in sets of three or more clutters the kitchen.",
    "862": "He drops a tray, picks it up as he runs from the church, and is then brought back to the church. The bishop looks up, brings over two candlesticks, hands them to Valjean, and places his hand on Valjean's head. Beside a tomb with carvings of two Christified figures, Valjean kneels at the altar with his papers in his hand and blood staining his temple. Having walked away from the altar, he returns and sinks to his knees. Valjean strides out of the church ripping his papers to shreds as he goes to the far corner of the churchyard and throws the pieces into the air, with one piece flying high towards the sun. The church in the walled village sits on the top of a hill. Javert in uniform rides in the rain ahead of four other uniformed horsemen and they enter the city. In a dark cobbled slum, a woman takes a wrapped body of a child from a weeping mother. In a factory, a worker snatches a note and Fantine tries to retrieve it. Valjean, clean-shaven with dark and neatly trimmed hair, is smartly dressed and looks every inch a gentleman. He glances up to an office and sees Javert gazing down at the factory floor. Unnerved, Valjean walks away from the women. The foreman throws Fantine out onto the street and flings coins at her. Valjean in a courtyard sees the other uniformed horseman who accompanies Javert. Inside, Javert paces in the office. Valjean slowly makes his way up the stairs, the two men bow, Javert removes his hat and hands a paper to Valjean, who hands Javert a rosary. Javert lowers his gaze and they rush out onto the cobbled street where a man is trapped under a cart. Valjean is crouched down beside him as Javert watches Valjean place his shoulder under the shaft. As he did with the flagpole, Valjean grimaces as he gets to his feet and lifts the cart off the trapped man. Javert's eyes narrow, Val drops the shaft, Javert hesitates then bows his head, and turns away. Fantine walks quickly along the streets, passes people standing in the darkness with a shawl wrapped tightly around her, and stops and stares forlornly. She passes a man smoking a long pipe and women seated, approaches a scruffy man, and her sleek, long dark hair is cut. Fantine is held down as a tooth extractor is pushed into her mouth, takes a swig from a small bottle, has her hand placed in a man's who is wearing a captain's hat. The captain pushes her down and turns her over, slowly raising the hem of her dress.",
    "868": "Marius calls out to Valjean. Cannons are fired, splintering the barricade and throwing up clouds of smoke. The students keep shooting at the soldiers. Wood splinters and flies through the air as more cannon balls hit the barricade. Some of the students are injured. Soldiers advance on the barricade and start to climb up it. The students keep shooting. A soldier is slashed with a sword. A student is bayoneted in the back. Students hammer on the door of a house but it's locked. A shutter is pulled closed. They manage to get into a building. Marius is shot. He falls to the ground, his head and arm bleeding. Valjean goes to him and drags him into the building. Enjolras hacks the wooden stars away so the soldiers can't follow. The students climb up to the first floor of the building. Soldiers burst into the building with guns blazing. Marius is over Valjean's shoulder. Valjean hides behind a door. Soldiers aim their muskets up at the ceiling. Enjolras and the students are huddled in the room above. The shots go up through the floor hitting most of the students. They fall. Valjean sees a low door and yanks it open. He climbs down into a sewer and drags Marius in with him. The soldiers are now upstairs. They aim their weapons at Enjolras and a fellow student, the only ones left standing. Enjolras raises the red flag and soldiers open fire. Enjolras falls back through a window. He hangs upside down from the ledge still clutching the red flag. Later on the cobble street below, Javert, now in uniform, walks through a puddle of blood. The cobbles are strewn with the corpses of soldiers. Javert walks into the building where the protesters took refuge. The dead students are laid neatly side by side on all the floor. His eyes stare out lifelessly from his young, pale face. Javert squats down at the end of the line beside the corpse of Gavroche. Javert looks around, moved by the scene. He removes from his jacket the star shaped Legion of Honor medal with its red ribbon and pins it to Gavroche's coat. Javert frowns and his eyes dart about wildly. He gets up and looks around. He goes to a door, turns the handle, and pushes it open. In the sewer, Valjean is heaving the unconscious Marius along. On ground level, Javert hears Valjean straining. He tries to find the source of the noise. He goes to another door. Javert listens and peers down at a round entrance to the sewers. Valjean slips down a duct tunnel. He and Marius plummet into the cavernous sewers landing unconscious in dark sludge. On ground level, Javert frowns.",
    "87": "The preacher's eyes crinkle as he turns to Pearl, smiling brightly, then his eyes snap back to John, his voice sharp. His gaze remains fixed on John as Pearl gapes up at him while he speaks. John gets up, a cellar door visible in the background, and they cross towards it. The children precede the preacher, who carries a candle in a holder. Pearl is still gaping at John's lie as he looks left and right, casing the joint. They reach the bottom of the stairs, and John sees Pearl's expression, taking her hand and squeezing it harder as he points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars, far from the stairs. The preacher starts towards it but turns, catching John's ruse, and shepherds them ahead of him. They arrive beneath the shelf, and the preacher sets the candle on a barrel, sinking to his knees as Pearl gapes at John and John looks stony. She seems about to speak while the preacher's hands sweep dust, exposing concrete. He straightens on his knees, turning to the children in the background, his sincerity beyond doubt. He takes out his knife and springs it open as she starts to sob, the preacher astounded. His hands fall away from John, and he leans back against the wall, talking through laughter, his eyes all over the place. The preacher makes a lunge across John for the doll, but John ducks, pulling Pearl forward and knocking over the candle, pulling out the support on the shelf. Jars shower over him, one breaking and shedding guck, which he wipes from his eyes. They start up the stairs, the preacher making one step forward, stepping on a rolling jar, and falling. Near the top, John slips and they nearly fall backward, but as John recovers, the preacher enters the shot. The children get through the open door as the preacher reaches the top, and John slams the door, catching the preacher's hand. The preacher screams as John's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door, which loosens, allowing the preacher to yank his hand loose, groaning. The door slams shut, and the bolt is shot home. The preacher snarls like the Big Bad Wolf as Pearl, dangling her doll, cries, and John, panting, leans against the wall by the door, wondering what to do now. A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist shows as they run across and leave the shot, the preacher's fists hammering against the door audible before they disappear.",
    "871": "She puts up an umbrella as he helps her out. They climb the spiral staircase inside the building. Nick leans in and kisses Kate full on the lips. Nick looks back briefly as he descends the stairs. Kate grins to herself. In the amber half-light of a darkened room, Kate is fast asleep in bed. The door is ajar. The hallway light comes on, and Zoe slips past the open door clutching a video. Kate stares as she sees Zoe. Wearing pajamas, Kate wanders down the hallway towards a dull, flickering light emanating from the lounge. She pauses outside the open lounge door. Zoe sits on the floor. Zoe watches a home movie of Christine frolicking on a dull, wind-swept beach. She flaps her arms as if pretending to fly as she runs down to the edge of a grey sea. Kate enters the lounge, and joins Zoe on the floor. Now, the TV screen fills with Christine and Zoe's ecstatically happy faces. Christine kisses her smiling daughter on the cheek and beams back at the camera. Attractive, long blonde haired Christine throws back her hair and laughs joyously. Tears well in Zoe's doleful eyes. Kate looks away from the TV and down at Zoe. She puts an arm around her niece. Zoe leans into Kate as the video plays. Christine is running along the beach, waving back at the camera, her jacket and scarf flapping behind her. The grainy video comes to an end. Morning, Kate and Zoe are in Zoe's bed. They lie facing each other, Zoe with her arm on Kate's shoulder. Daylight fills the room. Kate watches a sleeping Zoe. Zoe stares. A smile flickers across Zoe's lips. Then, she closes her eyes again. Kate places an arm around Zoe, and she too closes her eyes. At the restaurant. Bernadette reads a letter. Now, Zoe runs out of her bedroom and down the corridor chased by Kate, who ambushes her coming out of the lounge. Feathers fly as Kate and Zoe gleefully batter each other with their pillows. Kate pushes Zoe backwards onto the sofa. Exhausted, the pair collapse onto the hall floor. Feathers drift down around them. At the restaurant, Nick commands a hectic kitchen. The dining room is packed. Paula and her waiting staff move busily around the tables. Later, she and Nick relax with a brandy. Paula eyes Nick with a smile. Kate's fast asleep in bed. Kate flicks on her bedside lamp. She rises and, wearing her dressing gown, answers the intercom. Nick and Kate sit across from each other at a desk in the lamp-lit lounge. He spoon-feeds the blindfolded Kate some sauce from a container between them. In the soft glow of the lamp, Nick observes Kate with a smile.",
    "878": "Kate arrives home and looks around with a frown, making her way through to the kitchen. She sees a plate of cigarette ends on the table, picks it up, and empties the cigarette butts into the bin. Looking at a clock above the stove, she makes her way down the hall to Zoe's bedroom. Zoe has made herself a den under the bed with several stuffed toys. Kate nods, peers under the bed, and Zoe gives a brief nod before looking away, then turning back to give a faint smile. Kate kisses her fingers, touches Zoe's forehead, and pulls the valance sheet down. She stands up, walks slowly out of the bedroom, and leaves the door open. The next day, Kate and Zoe walk down the street towards the restaurant. Paula looks up as they enter, and Kate leads Zoe towards the kitchen. In the kitchen, Zoe sits on a worktop swinging her legs while Kate chats to Leah. Nick overhears, searches on a shelf, and brings out a bowl and bunch of basil. He picks the leaves and holds them out to Zoe, who smells it and begins to help him. Paula walks in and then goes back into the restaurant. Later, Nick prepares spaghetti and sits beside Zoe, sprinkling basil over his meal. Zoe watches him shyly as he eats, then eyes the food hungrily. A waiter addresses the kitchen, and Nick hands the bowl of spaghetti to Zoe. She looks down at the pasta, picks up the fork, and takes a mouthful, then tucks in hungrily and grins at Nick. Walking back into the kitchen, Kate ties her apron around her waist and sees Zoe devouring the spaghetti.",
    "883": "Mary prepares to play and the men quickly take their places opposite their partners. As the music starts, the ladies curtsy and the men bow. A group of onlookers gather. Mrs. Bennet turns to glare at her husband. The men stand in one line with the ladies opposite them, then briefly touch hands as they move around the other dancers. Mrs. Gardiner crosses the room and sees Charlotte and Jane sitting down. Charlotte's busy chatting with someone, but Jane looks quietly upset. Later, the girl with red hair is standing with Wickham as Charlotte and Lizzie look on. Wickham smiles at Lizzie as he takes the girl's hand and leads her down through the column of dancers. Lizzie smiles back at him, then turns to look at Charlotte, who has a serious expression on her face. Lizzie turns her attention back to the dance floor where the red haired girl is eyeing Wickham coyly. Charlotte grabs Lizzie's arm. Mary King continues to dance with Wickham, smiling contentedly. Winter has arrived and the ground outside Longbourn is crisp with a white layer of frost. Lizzie's reading a letter. Jane walks out, then she's sitting looking out of her window. A carriage pulls up and Caroline gets out. Caroline climbs back into her carriage and it sets off down the street. Jane stares dolefully out of her window. Back at Longbourn, Lizzie lowers her sister's letter with a pained expression. It's a mild, sunny day and Lizzie is taking a walk in a field near Longbourn. She wanders past post and rail fencing surrounding an old oak tree, idly toying with a leafy twig. As she reaches the grounds of Longbourn, she tosses the twig away and wanders up the graveled driveway to the house. She has a pensive, yet carefree air. Her face framed by the straw brim of her gold-colored bonnet. Lydia comes running out to meet her. In the garden. They continue on past the gardener, who's busily pruning a bush. She casually reaches out to a branch above her head, and pulls off a leaf. Indoors, Mr. Bennet is reading. Hearing a noise from the hall, he looks up from his book to see trunks being moved, and Lizzie standing in her coat and bonnet. She comes in to see him. She goes over to him, and he takes a hand and kisses it. He watches her leave with an endearing smile, then goes back to his book. Lizzie is sharing her carriage with Maria and Sir William Lucas. The horse-drawn carriage continues on past the green canopy of trees. Eventually, it pulls through the gates and into the drive of a sizable, ivy-clad house. Mr. Collins and Charlotte hurry out to meet them as Lizzie, Maria, and Sir William emerge from the cab.",
    "891": "Jane and Bingely stand out amongst the dancers, moving with each other easily and sharing smiles. The dancers move in intricate and formal patterns, circling their partners, then crossing to form lines. The women hold out their arms gracefully, forming delicate arcs before gliding back into their starting positions. They separate, then come back. Darcy looks at Lizzie defiantly, and whilst his back is turned, Lizzie smiles to herself and raises her eyebrows. They're interrupted by Sir William. A look of growing concern crosses Darcy's face. Once again, the dance forces them apart. Lizzie's brow furrows into a frown. Now opposite each other, Darcy is beginning to look a little agitated as he circles another dancer. Lizzie looks a little pleased with herself as the dance draws to a close. The gentlemen and ladies bow and curtsy to each other. Darcy takes Lizzie's hand and leads her from the floor. He bows curtly and leaves. Lizzie watches after him, frustratedly. Now the guests are gathered in a different room. Mr. Bennett joins Mrs. Bennett at the dining table, where she's eating with relish. Jane and Lizzie stand with a happy group, including Bingley. Lizzie smiles and leaves them, meeting Miss Bingley, who swans off. Lizzie looks furious. She strides to a punch bowl and serves herself a cup. A concerned Jane follows her. Mary leaps up from her chair and scurries to the piano. Jane and Lizzie look mortified at Mary's clumsy playing. A furious Miss Bingley signals for her sister to follow her. They brush past Lizzie and Jane, and start maliciously whispering to each other. Darcy and Bingley look at Mary. Mr. Bennet looks embarrassed. Only Mrs. Bennet seems to be really enjoying it. Mr. Darcy stands, towering over Mr. Collins. Darcy walks away. He passes Lizzie, and joins the Bingley sisters. Outside, dogs are reacting to Mary's singing. Inside, the Bingley sisters look at Mary with barely disguised contempt. Lizzie gives her father a desperate look. He jumps up from his seat and joins Mary at the piano. Mary peels off her glasses and leaves the piano, head bowed. Louisa Hurst briskly crosses the room and sits at the piano. Mr. Collins stands awkwardly at the piano, silenced by the playing, trying to cover up by waving his hands to the music. Lydia comes skipping and swirling into the room, holding an officer's sword above her head, then collapses in a chair. Lizzie looks mortified. Mrs. Hurst smiles smugly. Mrs. Bennet closes the door on them, then leans in to eavesdrop, and scurries away. He holds up a hand to stop her and she takes a seat. He looks shocked. He rises from bended knee. She hurries out",
    "893": "Words appear. Wearing 50 black and white striped uniforms, prisoners march in lockstep single file across the dirt, each man holding the shoulders of the man in front. A prison guard in a dark blue overcoat squints at them as they pass. Nearby, one prisoner lies motionless at another guard's feet. The line of prisoners continues away from a wall 30 feet high, guards on either side of them. They march toward a stark building, where a smoke stack reaches into the sky. On a dirt road populated by a few rundown establishments, a Nash sedan stops. The driver's door opens and a tall man with bony features steps out wearing a badge. He opens the back door and helps a raven-haired man in handcuffs step out. Both wearing long overcoats, they walk across the street toward the prison. At the middle of a long high wall, a metal entry gate sits under a lookout tower. As they're near the entrance, the officer gives the convict a little shove. The metal gate opens. Just inside, an older guard opens a steel door. As the metal gate closes behind them, the two men pass the guard with no more than a nod from the arriving officer. Inside the prison, inmate's central room filled with work benches, each with its own sewing machine. A prisoner with graying temples lifts a box labeled Mayer Thread Company from a stack. As he carries it across the room, he glances at a presiding guard. With a slight feint, the inmate brings the box past another guard to a work bench. Reaching the bench, he joins a sandy-haired prisoner and sets the box down. They tear off the outer tape. Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun, and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and a man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of work benches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts concealing his weapon and grabs one of the guards. The younger inmate punches another guard in the face and holds his gun to his throat. A stocky prisoner repeatedly strikes a guard with a pipe as the older inmate follows closely behind. Each of the escaping prisoners leads their hostage to the door. The rest of the befuddled inmates stand at their benches. The younger inmate jabs his captive in the gut. Now the newly arrived convict stands behind his presiding officer and another guard at a door.",
    "91": "The scene opens with the sounds of regular breathing and snoring. The woman stirs and reaches for the phone, then hangs up. The man stirs, clears his throat with a long deep rumble, sits up, and gazes around confusedly before clearing his throat again. Remnants of a large breakfast consisting of eggs, ham, and toast are seen. The perspective widens to show Marge now dressed in a beige police uniform, complete with a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie, and various other police tools. Norm is in a dressing gown as Marge struggles into a parka and makes her way down the icy front stoop to her prowler. Off-screen, the front door opens, and Marge stamps the snow off her shoes. The reverse shot shows Marge approaching from her own squad car. Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of the road, each containing a pair of men. The driver's door of the first car opens, and a figure in a parka emerges, holding two styrofoam cups. He hands one of the cups of coffee to Marge, and they start walking as Marge looks around. Marge peers into the car, looks up, and then around at the road before getting up and sweeping snow from her knees. Her prowler is parked nearby. She calls up to the road and is then seen on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch, examining footprints in the snow. The head of the state trooper is in the foreground, facing us, with Marge peering at it from behind. She gets up, claps the snow off her hands, and climbs out of the ditch, looking at the prowler idling on the shoulder. Marge is driving with Lou sitting next to her, gazing out the window in thought. Jerry and Stan stand bundled in their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles. Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for Stan. There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the Lincoln. Jerry stares down at his laptop. The scene shifts to a lakeside cabin surrounded by white. A brown Ciera with dealer plates pulls into the drive. Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out of the driver's. Grimsrud opens the back door and helps Jean out with an arm on her elbow. She has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head. With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and lurches away across the front lawn. Grimsrud moves to retrieve her, but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder.",
    "912": "Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils, and stares forward with a steely gaze. Red peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Dillinger stands below an overcast sky, with strands of his greasy black hair hanging over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road, which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farm house, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table. Pete buttons up next to another escapee. Red puts out a cigarette. All of the men leave. Outside, Dillinger walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him. They hold eye contact and she lets go. As Dillinger turns and walks away from the farm house, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. In the car, as Red drives, Dillinger looks back at Pete. He faces forward and glances at Red. A man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a Tommy gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him, toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill. The outlaw races downhill into an apple orchard. At the hill's crest, the clean-cut lawman stops and watches the outlaw run between two rows of trees. He aims his rifle. Floyd runs backwards, firing wildly. The lawman's shot misses. Floyd runs on. Calmly taking a knee, the lawman aims again, rubbing his finger on the trigger. Floyd sprints through the trees, almost out of his pursuer's sight. The lawman's finger engages a secondary trigger, then wraps around the main trigger. The shot blasts through Floyd's belly and he flops on the grass. The shooter gazes up from his sights, then stands and approaches the outlaw with the rest of the men following behind. As the men arrive, Floyd takes out a pistol which the lawman kicks out of his hand. He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw, who lies on his back. Purvis' piercing stare remains fixed on the dying man. Blood gushes from Floyd's belly wound, saturating his white dress shirt. His head falls back on the grass and his convulsing throat muscles come to rest. The lawmen lower their weapons. Purvis studies the dead outlaw then nods at his men. Purvis slings his rifle strap over his shoulder, closes his eyes and purses his lips. The Nash sedan comes to a stop. In a clean, white kitchen, a woman standing near the sink folds a newspaper.",
    "913": "Two other women sit at a table; one writes, the other looks out the window. A large man in suspenders peers through the blinds, then turns away from the window and hurries out of the room. Outside, Dillinger and his men step out of their car and, as they approach the house, a young blonde woman greets them. He grins and gives the blonde a kiss, then they head inside. Later, in a garage, Dillinger sits across from a gunsmith as he disassembles a Tommy gun, removing the trigger handle and pulling out a coil. Outside a window behind the gunsmith, two cars arrive. Red steps out of the safe house. Dillinger glances at the door where the blonde nods to him, then he gets up and leaves the garage. As he crosses to the house, Dillinger tosses a set of keys to Pete, who joins Red to see the new cars. Inside, Dillinger enters the kitchen where a man leans against the refrigerator. Dillinger washes his hands as a woman smokes at the table. He hands the man a stuffed envelope, goes around the table, kisses her cheek, and leaves the kitchen. Three men in fedoras and overcoats ascend a wide staircase, separated from each other by two center railings. Reaching the top, Dillinger stops, scanning a huge bank with angular walls lined with pillars. His two cohorts split off. Pete approaches a guard, bashes his face, and knees him in the gut. Tommy gun in hand, Dillinger hurtles a counter and grabs a middle-aged man. Ripping the back of his collar, Dillinger parades the bank president around the counter and across the floor, passing a trembling customer. He pushes the president forward to a metal gate. One of his men collects cash from a teller as the president sorts keys. Dillinger smacks him in the head with his pistol and points it in his face. The president returns to the door. A robber elbows open a teller cage as the teller frantically gathers cash. Pete hops up on the counter, aiming his machine gun. Outside, Homer discreetly holds a rifle at his side. He sees an arriving police car and backs into a recess by a set of double doors, knocking with the butt of his rifle. Inside the bank, Dillinger waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe. In a getaway car, Red checks the time on a pocket watch, then drives away. As policemen run across the street toward the bank, Red's car approaches and Homer casually glances over. Inside, Dillinger pushes the president forward, noticing a few dollars in change set out on the counter, and faces the customer it belongs to.",
    "914": "Outside, Homer bashes the cop with the butt of his rifle, uses him as a shield and fires. Inside, a young female teller hurries to Dillinger and they head back down the stairs. Outside, Homer shoots up the police car; another police car arrives down the block. Red waits in his car as the robbers exit with four hostages. Down the road, lawmen aim rifles over the car's hood. Dillinger and his men, using their hostages as shields, cross to the getaway car. Dillinger aims at the police over the president's shoulder. An officer fires first. Homer aims his automatic rifle and with Dillinger, they shoot up the other police car, taking out a couple lawmen. Their car speeds off with Dillinger and Homer on the running boards with their hostages. As they drive down the street, the tails of the crooks' overcoats flap in the breeze. The car comes to a stop under a bridge. Dillinger faces Homer's hostage. The two hostages run off. Dillinger notices his young hostage shivering. He wraps his overcoat around her and guides her into the backseat. Red drives off. In the car, Dillinger hands the teller his hat. The car heads down a dirt road leading toward a forest of leafless trees. Homer sits next to the young teller. Pete cracks up. Now in the woods, they tie the president and the young teller to a tree. The bank robbers leave their hostages and stride out of the trees. Reaching their car, they get in and drive away. Now, in a marble hearing room, a square-jawed man faces a committee. He tilts his ear toward the chairman. The mustached senator looks Director Hoover in the eye. Hoover whispers to a bespectacled man. Hoover marches out with the bespectacled Suydam and a slender young man. As they walk down a hall, Suydam takes notes. Hoover looks to his young associate. Now a fedora sits on a burgundy leather couch by Purvis, who gazes off thoughtfully. As Hoover exits a nearby office, Purvis stands. They cross an FBI bullpen. The men step onto a sunny veranda, where reporters gather. Hoover faces a microphone. Hoover motions for Purvis to take his place at the mic. Purvis squints decisively at the reporters. Now at his supper club, Dillinger grins as he dines with his friends. He checks his watch and looks toward the door. Rubbing the tip of his nose, he shifts his gaze to the dance floor where a brunette in a red dress dances with a man. Dillinger keeps his eyes fixed on her. His attention shifts as a scrawny guy with glasses approaches. Dillinger stands and shakes his hand. The scrawny Alvin takes a seat beside Dillinger and leans close.",
    "92": "She slides the paper sack toward him. He looks inside. The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms. Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot. Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform. The club, not yet open for business, is deserted. With one last bang we cut. In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm. A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house. Marge and Norm are watching television in bed. After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs, still looking at the set. Marge gropes in the dark. He sits in and picks up his phone. Jerry sits dumbly. He angrily snatches it up. He goes back to his food. Gary hands her a flimsy. Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food. Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest. He stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, and then swallows and says. Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table. The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging fixture. On the table the remains of coffee and a cinnamon filbert ring are present. Marge is at the reception desk. The clerk types into a computer console. Marge is on a public phone. The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot. It stops by one car and Carl emerges. He quickly scans the lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate. Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket. The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket. The attendant is still puzzled. The attendant doesn't say anything. Carl glances back, starts digging for money. He is peeling off one dollar bills. Bewildered, he looks about, then asks a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the shop. The mechanic points. Jerry looks. Jerry stares, swallows. Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle. Marge and Shep silently talk. Shep says nothing. Shep stares at her. Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk. Marge has stucked in the door. Marge plops into the chair opposite him. Jerry stares at her, his mouth open. As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him. Marge enters. She looks around the bar, a rather characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people. It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising from a booth halfway back.",
    "926": "He takes the metal case and walks out. A small car comes flying round a corner. He hesitates, then clocks her handbag and opens it without her seeing. There's a guy on a moped behind them. She streaks across the traffic, causing chaos. The moped guy has to stop. The brunette, with high cheek bones, turns the little car into an alley off the road. Their pursuer tries to work out where they've gone. She pouts sexily, and gestures to the case. They look through papers as moped guy looks for them. The papers are all blank. He grabs her wrist as she fires. Then, as the moped gets closer, he jumps out of the car. He turns to see the moped guy approaching. He flips the bike out from under him, kicks him in the face, then rides off. He's a few cars behind the girl. Bond rides impassively, following the girl's little bronze car. They arrive at a quay where boats are being unloaded. Furiously she storms past a guard in dark glasses. Bond rides onto the quay, and clocks the guard in a floral shirt, carrying a sub-machine gun. The girl strides into an office as an official stamps a docket. She stands over the Frenchman. The thin German speaker looks nervous. There's a body floating in the water under the quay. A powerful speedboat approaches. He gives the guard a card and looks up at a security camera before walking off. The German in square shades looks at a card from Universal Exports. Bond activates the tracking function on his phone. \"Pay attention next time.\" He approaches the heavyset general with the bushy mustache. He holds up a map. The general eyeballs the little Frenchman and takes the map nodding. The girl glares at them. He waves her over. A burly hand grabs her arm. Bond watches with a frown, then rides away. Camille is led to the speedboat. Bond rides through the busy docks standing in the saddle to look around. Dominic waves an ironic goodbye as the boat with Camille on it pulls away. She looks with sultry hatred in his direction. Bond jumps the bike off the quay into a boat. Rides over some crates, jumps onto another boat then abandons the machine. The launch is heading towards a huge luxury cruiser. Bond runs across the closely packed boats crammed with merchandise. He leaps onto a small launch, pulls the starting cord on the outboard motor and starts to shadow the general's boat. He rams the boat. Dominic watches in disbelief as the crew on the cruise grab weapons and jump into an inflatable. Bond boards the launch. Camille grabs a gun but Bond knocks into the water, grabs her and drags her off the boat into his.",
    "930": "Mathis hands him an envelope. Tousle-headed Bond puts down his champagne glass and heads back to the bedroom. He kisses her naked back. She smiles and turns her face towards him. He pulls her back down onto a bed. DJ plays under a full moon. Trays are being served and cocktails sipped. A Range Rover pulls up at the entrance. Bond gets out, accompanied by Fields in a glamorous black and gold dress. He moves through the press of glamorous party goers. He shakes another hand. CIA agent Felix watches from a sofa. They look down from a stone balustrade. She kisses him and he shoves her hard against the crumbling stonework. The thin German arrives. Fields passes. The CIA men are sitting together. He belts up as he goes around to the driver's side of the Range Rover. Motorcyclists follow them. He parks the car. The two motorcycle cops pull up behind. Bond hands over his license to the cop who is wearing dark glasses at night. As he opens it, the cop draws. Mathis is lying in the trunk. Bond pulls the unconscious man out. With his colleague's gun, throws the other down, calmly shoots him and empties the gun and tosses it aside. Bond cradles him in his arms. Camille watches them. His head slumps against Bond's shoulder. Expressionlessly, Bond feels for a pulse. Camille shifts uneasily. He drops the body in a dumpster, removes Mathis' wallet from his jacket, takes out the cash, and tosses the wallet aside. They walk off, leaving the body slumped amid the rubbish bags in the dumpster. The Range Rover heads down a desert highway. M stares coldly. The Range Rover drives through the dusty, barren. It arrives at a small airstrip. The man, in a leather jacket and brimmed hat is. He turns as Bond his jacket to cover a bloodstain on his shirt. Bond looks at an old propeller transport plane as Camille gets out of the car. The ageing DC-3 Dakota lumbers down the runway, raising a cloud of dust in it. The man in a hat is already on the phone as the old plane takes to the air. A fighter streaks past them and banks for another pass. Bond puts the plane into the dive working the controls furiously as the fighter loops to get behind them. The fighter streaks in. Bond flies down into a valley. Camille looks alarmed and Bond concentrates hard as they skim the valley floor. He lowers the under carriage. They hit the ground hard. He pulls the throttle back open. The fighter hurtles down the valley after them, perilously close to a rocky outcrop. Fields gets out of her seat and moves down the plane's fuselage.",
    "936": "Holmes looks up at him. He pulls him up and removes the meat hook from his shoulder. Watson helps Holmes up and supports him as the pair make their way back across the factory floor. They pass several Howitzers, which stand ready to be shipped out of the factory. They arm themselves. Watson has a machine gun, Holmes a pistol. Watson leads the way. In the ruins, Moran frees Moriarty from the rubble. Sim spots Holmes and Watson. She runs on ahead of them. Holmes sees some guards. Watson opens fire. Watson lays down covering fire as Sim and the gypsies lead the way out of the factory. As Watson retreats and reloads, Holmes shoots a guard dead. He reloads and follows the others out into a rail yard. One of the gypsies is killed by the rough-looking twins. Holmes and Watson return fire, killing them both. The raiders make their way to the perimeter wall of the rail yard and throw a rope over the top of it. Before they can escape, they're spotted by the guards, who open fire, forcing the fugitives to take cover. Watson returns fire with his machine gun, but the guards respond with a heavy-caliber Gatling gun, forcing Watson and the others to take cover behind some crates. A huge artillery piece is turned on them. The shell goes over their heads and blasts a hole in the perimeter wall. Holmes and the others run for it, out into the woods beyond. In the distance, a railway line runs through the trees and a train is approaching. The captain of the guards rallies his troops and sends them through the breach in the perimeter wall to chase the fugitives down. As the guards shoot through the trees at the fugitives, others in the rail yard adjust the elevation on the mortars and open fire. Explosions erupt around Holmes, Watson, and the others. They keep running, heading towards the railway line. Giving chase, Moran picks up a rifle and takes a shot at Watson. The bullet clips his right flank, but he keeps running. Bullets from the guards rip chunks out of the tree trunks. Holmes returns fire with his pistol, hitting a guard in the chest. Massive explosions erupt amongst the trees as Sims sprints forward. The guards give chase. Moran takes another shot, hitting one of the gypsies. Sims sees the man go down but keeps running. Little Hansel is a heavy-caliber artillery piece. A massive shell is loaded into the breach. The elevation of the barrel is adjusted, and a powder charge is loaded. Final adjustments to the barrel elevation are made, and the gun crew chief gives the order to fire.",
    "937": "A lever is pulled, releasing a ratchet, and igniting the powder charge. The massive gun recoils violently as a huge ball of flame erupts from its muzzle. The shock wave blows one of the gun crew's hat off. In the woods, the shell rips through a tree trunk, splintering it into matchwood, and fells another tree just behind Holmes, missing him by a whisker. The shell explodes ahead of him, shattering the trees and filling the air with needle-sharp splinters. The epic blast blows the fugitives off their feet. The guards keep coming, closing in. Holmes lies still for a few moments, temporarily stunned by the blast. As dirt falls on his face, he comes to. He and Watson get to their feet. Watson immediately tackles a guard. As fierce hand-to-hand fighting breaks out, Moran runs towards the fray. A gypsy shoots a guard just before a mortar shell goes off beside Holmes. As he leans against a tree, a guard comes at him. The bullet hits the tree, then the guard tries to bayonet Holmes. Holmes punches the guard away and reloads the guard's rifle. He hands it to Watson, who uses it to shoot Moran as he appears over a rise. Holmes, Watson, Sim, and the surviving gypsies run to the train and scramble into one of the boxcars. As they're doing so, Moran starts to sit up. He examines his injury. As Holmes climbs up into the boxcar, Moran gets his gun and takes several deep breaths. He loads his rifle and takes aim. He shoots one of the gypsies as he tries to board the train. One of the other gypsies watches from the boxcar as his dead comrade is left behind. Moran stares after the train as it carries Holmes and the others to safety. The track winds along a wooded valley. Morning, the train makes its way across a snow-covered plain with craggy mountains in the distance. Sim sits cradling Holmes in her arms as Watson stitches a wound in his own flank. Holmes closes his eyes. Sim regards Holmes with growing concern. She holds her hand in front of his mouth. Concerned, Watson goes over to her and examines Holmes, who's completely unresponsive. A gypsy does so. Watson pumps away at Holmes' chest, then thumps his chest. Still no response. Watson pounds Holmes' chest again. Sim pulls Watson away from Holmes and hugs him tight. The gypsy pats Watson on the shoulder. Watson looks down sadly at Holmes, who lies motionless in the boxcar. Something suddenly occurs to him. Watson opens the leather pouch which Holmes gave him and takes out a vial and hypodermic needle. Watson uncaps the needle and plunges it into Holmes' chest.",
    "939": "Watson watches as Moriarty heads off. The photographer prepares. Holmes is outside on a balcony, drinking from a hip flask. There is a rocking back fall stumble into the darkness nearby. Moriarty comes out and joins him. Moriarty goes to a table and picks up a chess timing clock. He puts the clock on another table beside a chessboard. Holmes takes a seat in front of the board. Moriarty fetches a blanket and puts it around Holmes' shoulders. Moriarty picks up a second blanket and drapes it around his own shoulders. Holmes and Moriarty both smile. Then Moriarty's expression hardens. He starts by moving a white pawn. He sets the time clock. Inside, Watson and Sim move amongst the guests. Outside on the balcony, Holmes advances a second black pawn on the game of chess. Inside, Watson and Sim meet up again. They look over at the delegates. Holmes' knight takes one of Moriarty's pawns. Moriarty advances a bishop. A man smokes a cigar. Sim studies the faces of the potential assassins. Hyperemic needle is concealed inside an especially-adapted Winchester cartridge case. Watson glances around the photographer about to take the delegates' photo. Watson deliberately knocks a tray of drinks out of a footman's hands. As it crashes onto the marble floor, everyone looks around in surprise except one man in the corner. Watson peers at the man's hairline and notes that he drops his cigar. Sim stares at the man as he steps away from the delegate he was talking to. She looks over at Watson, who nods. The man reaches inside his jacket with his left hand just as Sim steps up to him. Another man continues assembling the hyperemic cartridge. He shoves her aside and draws a gun. Watson tackles him as he takes a shot. Mycroft steps forward and his arms ready. Soldiers drag him away. The hyperemic cartridge is loaded into a weapon. As Rene is dragged away, Moran surreptitiously shoots him with a hyperemic cartridge fired from a gun hidden in his cane. Something occurs to Watson. He runs out of the ballroom and joins the soldiers guarding Rene. He's collapsed. The soldiers allowed him to tend to Rene who's convulsing on the floor. Watson quickly finds a hyperemic dart lodged in Rene's leg. He pulls it out and tastes the compound it's injected. Moran watches with a smile. Sim runs to Rene. Watson spots Moran leaving. He turns back to Rene who's fading fast. On the balcony, Holmes looks troubled. Unsettled, Holmes sits back in his chair. Moriarty shrugs the blanket off her shoulders and gets up on the table. Holmes removes his blanket and looks at the chessboard. Moriarty feels for his notebook and runs his thumb over the top line in his pocket.",
    "94": "Jerry stares at Marge. He explodes and gets angrily off his feet. He yanks his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabs a pair of galoshes, then stamps out the door. Marge stares, and after a long moment, her stare breaks. She pulls a clipboard toward her, holding a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation. She glances idly around the office, seeing another picture of Jean, looking around, and at the ceiling. Her look abruptly locks. Jerry makes a left turn into traffic. Marge grabs the phone and punches in a number. Grimsrud says nothing. Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door. He is pulled as he walks toward the car. Behind him, the cabin door opens. Carl turns, reacting to the sound. Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap, but no overcoat. He is holding an axe and swings it overhand, burying it in Carl's neck. In her cruiser, on her two-way, Marge hears Lou's voice, heavily filtered. She slows as she approaches a short driveway leading down to a cabin, parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera. Grimsrud stares. Conscious of the noise, Marge shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia. With a quick twist, Grimsrud reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge, and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself. Grimsrud pants up the hill—slow going through the deep snow. Behind him, Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. Marge glances up in the rear-view mirror. Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise, he is motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out. Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself. She glances up in the rear-view mirror again. Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out. Marge pulls over and leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. Outside it is snowing. The sky, the earth, the road—all white. She stares forward and shakes her head. A squad car, gum-balls spinning, punches through the white. It approaches in slow motion. An ambulance punches through after it, followed by another squad car. It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windswept plain. One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser. Looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms, one of them raps at the door. One of the policemen upholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back enters.",
    "940": "In his mind, Holmes sees the action about to unfold, with a thug holding a pocket watch and a knuckleduster, a knife being thrust at him, another attacker with a knuckleduster, and a third with a club. The men eye their leader, who makes a cutthroat gesture to them. The gang's leader has a gun. Holmes opens his eyes and lives the action. A blond thug tosses an apple. Holmes thwarts the knife thrust, spins the thug, and forces the blade into another. He throws the man with the club and snatches the gun from the leader's hand, then catches the apple as it falls and tosses it to the leader. Holmes empties the gun and hands it back, then makes to attack the leader, who shrinks back. Holmes jogs off. On foot, Irene Adler enters the auctioneers, Cromwell and Griff, and hands a package to a mature man, who gives her a letter. The doctor starts to open the package, but Irene rises, is held back, and sits. Holmes stops a sprung switch, kisses her, and teases the letter from her. The doctor removes a banknote from the package, revealing dynamite. His pipe ignites a tapestry, and the auction house clears. Irene heads out and tries to retrieve the letter, then goes. Holmes takes the ticking package from the doctor, runs to the sarcophagus, and the bomb explodes in the closed sarcophagus. The doctor has gone. Outside, the scruffy Holmes draws glances from a well-dressed queue of people. A bearded man in a tweed suit watches him closely, but turns away when Holmes turns. Holmes, with the back of his Oriental jacket covered in dust from the explosion, spots the doctor slumped against a wall, feels for a pulse, then notices a tiny dart in the man's thigh. He examines the dart, then turns to find the bearded man has disappeared. Holmes places the dart in his bag. Irene Adler is led to a table in the center of a grand restaurant and sits by a curtain, shielding her from a nearby table. She turns to the waiter, and her tea is poured. The bearded man in the tweed suit watches the speaker, then clinks a teaspoon against a glass, and all the clientele and staff, except him and the man behind the curtain, rise and leave the dining room. Irene stops sipping her tea and looks anxiously around as the place empties. The man behind the curtain draws it open. Irene closes her eyes, then glances down at her cup. The man has a rattled face and sports a beard.",
    "942": "Mycroft winces as Watson enjoys himself at the gaming tables and Mycroft chats with some other men. Meanwhile, Holmes goes upstairs to investigate where he saw a bearded man carrying a nosegay appear from behind the curtains earlier. Holmes parts the curtains and sees nosegays lying on a table. A woman stands with her back to him. He puts coins in a shell-shaped bowl. The high cheekboned brunette turns around. Holmes sits. Madam Sim lights a match from a candle and picks up a pack of tarot cards. Holmes stares intently at the pack and places a finger on his forehead. He takes the pack from her and flicks through them. He lays the Devil card down on the table. Holmes reaches inside his jacket and takes out the letter. He drops it on the table. Sim looks amazed and picks it up. Inside is a sketch of a man with a goatee beard. Holmes says, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history.\" She looks up from the letter. He gives her a look and gets up. She reaches for a gun. Holmes picks up an umbrella and in his mind, plans his attack on the Corsac. He swings the brolly, and the Corsac drops down. He knocks a knife from the man's hand. In slow motion, Holmes karate-chops the Corsac about the face. He delivers a kick in the groin and bludgeons the man with the brolly. The Corsac lunges with a knife. Holmes dodges the attack and hooks the umbrella handle around the man's throat. He throws the man over his shoulder and whacks him in the face. Now, for real, Holmes pulls the Corsac down from the rafters with the umbrella and disarms him. Sim kills the Corsac by throwing a knife into his chest. Holmes goes over to her. As Holmes and Sim leave, a man and two couples come in. The Corsac comes round and leaps to his feet. He takes off his heavy coat in which Sim's knife is embedded. Brandishing another blade, he goes after Holmes and Sim. He runs along the edge of a balcony within the building and somersaults off it down to a lower level, heading off Holmes and Sim. Holmes throws the Corsac, who back-flips off a wall and comes at him again. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, Watson is still playing cards and winning. Sim whacks the Corsac over the head with a bottle. Holmes twists his arm and throws him onto a sofa. They struggle, and the Corsac's blade scrapes Holmes' cheek. Holmes recoils. The Corsac goes after Sim. Holmes gives chase and tackles him to the floor. The Corsac springs up and grabs Sim by the hair.",
    "949": "The boys pick themselves up. Joe tries to open the back door, but in the main body of the bus, a technical sergeant has been knocked cold. Nelec picks himself up as the alien rocks the bus and gets on the radio. Joe tries to open the holding cell door but it's locked. Nelec comes to the door, just as a tentacle reaches in and crushes the driver. Joe pounds on a cracked window above them, then breaks the window with his elbow and climbs out onto the side of the bus. At the front, the giant spider-like alien is busy trying to reach in to get Nelec. Joe helps Martin out of the broken window followed by Charles, and then Carrie. Nelec fires at the alien with the assault rifle as it forces its way into the bus. The boys clamor down from the vehicle and run off the road to cover. The alien closes in on Nelec, apparently undeterred by the automatic fire. Nelec runs out of ammunition, and the alien lunges at him with his needle-sharp teeth. Lying in a ditch, the boys watch as the alien leaps off the bus and disappears into the woods. Air Force soldiers grab Louis in the evacuation center. Joe retrieves his locket from Overmyer's body and clocks the red bus as a car pulls up. Joe drives Donnie's car back into town, but Donnie has nodded off. A tank opens fire on them and Joe swerves to avoid the incoming round. More tanks close in, so the boys get out of the car and flee. A soldier speaks into his radio as the boys run, hurrying through a back garden, shoving a washing line out of their way. They leap a fence, then race through a gate onto the street, seeing a tank being overturned. Soldiers flee from their own malfunctioning machines, which randomly spray shells, missiles, and bullets around them. The boys flee through a playground from an out-of-control tank, hurrying up a hill and taking refuge in a house as the tank smashes up the playground. The boys hurry upstairs in the house, and Joe looks out of a window. A shell strikes the house and the blast knocks the boys to the ground. They get back up and Charles is about to strap up Martin's leg, which has been broken in the explosion. Joe and Cary run to the building in the cemetery, where Joe saw earth being thrown about. They try all the doors, but they're firmly locked. They break the doors open and step inside, discovering a tunnel leading into the Earth. Cary unzips his bag and a bunch of fireworks spill out. Joe lights one of the sparklers and tosses it into the tunnel.",
    "95": "Forrest opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse, who shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her. Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes, and a black woman stares at him as he looks down at his own shoes. Forrest closes his eyes tightly, and a little boy, young Forrest, does the same as he sits in a doctor's office. Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces, and the doctor sets him down on his feet. Forrest walks around stiffly, his mother, Mrs. Gump, watching him as he clanks around the room awkwardly. Forrest walks past the doctor and Mrs. Gump, and a loud thud is heard as he falls outside. Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street, Forrest walking stiffly next to his mother. A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head, now in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse. The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan members dressed in full uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street, and Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and tries to free Forrest as two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men, Mrs. Gump holding tightly onto Forrest's hand. They walk along a dirt road, a row of mailboxes standing left, and along the Gump Boarding House driveway. Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch and bends down to look him in the eye. The principal sighs, then stands up as Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits. The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump, Forrest sitting left and listening. Forrest sits outside the principal's office as loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits on a swing outside the house, the grunts continuing. The principal steps out of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face, Forrest sitting on the porch. The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at Forrest, who grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, turns and walks away. Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up. A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk toward the house, and a milkman steps down from the porch. A man with a cane steps left across the hall.",
    "950": "A Jeep motors along a quiet dark road with Jack driving and Louis sitting beside him. Louis looks over at Jack with a troubled expression, but Jack keeps his eyes on the road ahead while hiding deep emotions. Louis looks over again, and Jack gives him the briefest of glances. Meanwhile, at the cemetery, Joe and Cary climb down a rope into a tunnel that an alien has built, falling about 30 feet before touching the bottom. They stand at the edge of the pit, looking down, then hurry down the large bore tunnel with a faint flickering light up ahead. They round a corner and find a massive chamber filled with machinery and an industrial scale construction taking place. As they edge closer, they discover the sheriff hanging upside down from the roof of the tunnel, either dead or unconscious. Joe claps his hand over Cary's mouth to stop him from screaming as they notice more bodies hanging from the ceiling, none of them moving. The alien appears in the chamber, doing something behind some machinery, holding what appears to be a severed human leg before it scuttles off. Joe spots Alice dangling upside down and hurries away back up the tunnel, using a sparkler to light his way. Cary empties out his bag of pyrotechnics and selects some noisy fireworks, watching as the alien sets to work on its construction. Joe arrives at a fork in the tunnel and chooses which way to go, ending up quite close to Alice. He watches as the alien continues its work and eventually takes Alice down from where she's hanging. Cary tries to get his lighter to spark up and eventually succeeds, lighting a firecracker and leaving it beside a pile of other fireworks before running back down the tunnel. The alien puts Alice down and goes to investigate the noise. Joe breaks cover and runs over to Alice, who lies unresponsive on the chamber floor. He hesitates, then slaps her hard, and she wakes up, staring at him before hugging him tightly.",
    "951": "Joe looks taken aback, but pleasantly so. A girl, Tina, sits up nearby. They carefully lower the sheriff. The alien runs along the dark tunnel in pursuit of Cary, who flees up ahead of it. The alien suddenly stops in its tracks. The sheriff is up on his feet. Joe, Alice, and Tina follow the sheriff through the alien's maze of equipment. The sheriff shines his flashlight ahead of them. Cary rounds the corner. The alien grabs the sheriff. The others flee. Bringing up the rear, Tina is snatched by the creature and pulled back into the darkness. It comes after Joe and the others. The three friends run on down a dark tunnel until they come to a dead end and are forced to stop. The alien emerges from the shadows. Alice and Cary cower back from it. Joe stands his ground as it draws closer. The alien draws itself up to its full height of about 25 feet and Joe steps towards it. The alien cocks its head to one side. The others look on in horror as the alien picks Joe up. It holds him close to its face to get a look at him. The creature has a skull-like face with huge mandibles. The alien's breath ruffles Joe's hair as it breathes on him. It leans in close and retracts some protective membranes from over its eyes and its expression softens. Hearing the machinery, the alien looks away for a moment, then turns back to Joe. Alice watches warily as the alien puts Joe back on the ground. It turns and runs away back up the tunnel, on its many legs. Joe stares after it, catching his breath. Now back on the surface, Joe, Alice, and Cary join troops on a street in town. Strange magnetic force pulls metal items up off the ground and draws them towards the water tower. A bin, oil barrels, a table lamp, a bicycle and numerous other objects are all drawn irresistibly towards the tower. The items stick to the side of the structure. A shop window bursts open and television sets are hoovered up into the air. A soldier finds his rifle relentlessly drawn to the tower. He hangs onto it and is lifted up off the ground. He's pulled about 20 feet into the air before letting go. A car rises up out of the used car lot. Suddenly, the back of one of the military container lorries bursts open and the white cubes flood out of it. Joe, Alice, and Cary have to dive onto the ground as the cubes pass overhead. The cubes, cars, and other bits and pieces begin to fuse together, forming a gigantic structure on top of the tower.",
    "952": "Joe, Alice, and Cary pick themselves up and watch as a steady stream of metallic bits and pieces stream up towards the water tower and are melded into the ever-growing structure on top of it. Alice smiles as the vast structure begins to take shape. A Jeep drives up and Joe sees his dad and Louis get out of it. Jack looks up at the water tower, then spots Joe. Joe nudges Alice, who looks around and sees her dad with Jack. The dads walk towards them and Joe and Alice go to meet them. Jack cups Joe's face in his hands, then hugs him tight, their faces tense with a mixture of emotion and relief. Eyes closed, they hold each other tight. Alice looks over at her father as he steps up to her. They regard each other for a moment, then hug. Joe looks over Jack's shoulder at the water tower and sees the alien climbing up it. The creature steps into the now fully formed spaceship it's created on top of the water tower and the door closes behind it. The spaceship powers up and several arms on it rotate. Many bright lights on the arms shine out. Joe separates from his father and is just in time to grab his mother's locket, which is being drawn towards the tower. It hangs in the air, pulled by an invisible force. The locket clicks open, revealing the picture inside, which is of Joe's mother, holding him as a baby. Joe lets go of the locket's chain and it floats up towards the water tower. Joe and the others watch as the locket sticks to the side of the tower. Suddenly, the tower explodes in a shower of water, deluging the street below. The spaceship, which resembles the canopy of a palm tree, lifts into the air. The water tower collapses and crashes down into the street, scattering soldiers standing there, and crushing their vehicles. He, Joe, Alice, Louis, and Jack watch as the spacecraft gains altitude in a blaze of bright lights. Hobbling through town, Charles and Martin sit sailing up into the night sky. Still stoned in his car, Donny slumbers on as the spaceship flies by, its lights reflected in his windshield. As they watch it recede into the distance, Joe and Alice hold hands. Smiles spread across their faces. The spacecraft becomes a dot of light high up in the sky. Gradually, it becomes a pinpoint and then dies away altogether. A chalk outline of a body is drawn on the floor. Martin arrives as the detective and talks to a witness. At Romero Chemicals, Martin gets up and puts his hat on. Preston, as the President, makes a call.",
    "954": "It crashes into the Earth a little distance away. Noises emanate from the stricken carriage almost as if some angry beast were charging around inside it. On the remains of the platform, the Cinay camera runs out of film. The yellow Coupe, still largely unscathed, sits in the middle of the devastation. Joe makes his way past it, looking for the others. He climbs up onto some twisted railway tracks. He sees Preston. Thumbs up. Joe spots a blood stain. Joe walks slowly towards the ominous blood stain. The others gather round. Alice appears a little way behind them. Seeing her, Joe smiles. Joe turns back to the blood stained wreckage. He retrieves his makeup box. Alice sees the locket he's holding. He quickly stuffs it in his pocket. Joe picks up one of the strange white cubes which have spilled from the wreckage and pockets it before joining the others on top of a wrecked carriage. They have a good view across the devastation. Joe points to the mangled remains of the white pickup truck. They get down from the carriage. There's a guy at the wheel of the pickup. Alice approaches the un-moving black guy. The boys watch as Alice draws closer to him. She touches his arm and it hangs limply. A document spills from his hand. Alice picks it up and opens it as the boys crowd round. It's a map. Dr. Woodward grabs the map. He sits up stiffly. He looks round at the kids. Woodward pulls out a revolver. People are coming. The kids flee. Alice runs to the Coupe. The boys salvage their stuff including the camera. The boys run back to the car and they all scramble in. Alice drive them away as a large score of men in military uniforms brandishing guns and torches arrive on the scene. The soldiers stare after the car. One of the soldiers picks up a discarded Super 8 film box and studies it. He looks up thoughtfully. In the car. Back in town, the boys get out of the car. Alice hands Joe the white cube he took from the crash site. Their faces grimed from the explosions, Alice and Joe regard each other for a moment. Then Alice gets into the Coupe's driving seat and heads off. Joe and the others watch her go. At home, Joe sits in the bath, clutching the white cube, which has a knobbly surface. He stares thoughtfully into the distance. Seen from a hillside, the lights of Lillian twinkle in the darkness. The next morning, Joe is asleep in bed. Later, he puts out dog food. Clutching a script, he runs over to the Kaznyk's house. Joe joins Charles, who's watching the TV.",
    "956": "He stumbles and runs back into the shop. Something comes after him. It smashes the windows, knocking him to the floor, then grabs him, dragging him back. Next day, Joe is making Alice up as one of the un-dead. Alice gives Joe a questioning look. She nods pensively. The lights in the room flickered. Alice adopts a dead-eyed zombie persona and lurches slowly towards Joe. Waving her arms around jerkily, she draws closer. She lunges at him, pretending to bite his neck. They regard each other, smiling. Alice goes. Charles had been watching them. Jack is at the wrecked gas station. The manager of the station, Eddie, is with him. The sheriff's car is missing from the scene, but fragments of its lights remain. On a used car lot, the engines have been stolen from all the cars. Jack watches suspiciously as a convoy of military lorries passes by on the road. In the back of one, he notes some airmen operating some kind of radio listening device. As dusk approaches, Joe cycles beside a pylon in a field as he looks for his dog. He gets off his bike and looks around. Back in town, Joe cycles up beside a community bulletin board and sticks a flyer on it. As he looks at the board, something strikes him. He takes a step back and sees that the entire board is covered in flyers for lost dogs of all shapes and sizes. Joe returns home to find Jack at the dinner table with his other deputies, Tally, Mina, Rosko, Ross and Jay. Joe drops a torch. The cops look round. The lights flicker. Jack gets on his radio. A telecom engineer's truck drives along a dark road. Rooney is working on a power line outside a junkyard. He works from the cherry picker on the back of his truck. A noise emanates from the junkyard and he looks over at it for a moment, then gets back on with his job. Bits of scrap fly up into the air from the junkyard. Rooney watches with mounting concern as a huge hunk of junk sails overhead and lands in the road. It's a cooker. Rooney operates the controls for his cherry picker and gets it to raise him higher so that he can get a better view of the junkyard. The activity in the yard appears to have stopped. As he peers into the gloom, Rooney notices the headlights of his truck and the streetlight nearby start to flicker. The cherry picker has stopped working. Something suddenly lunges out of the trees and grabs him, jolting his truck and breaking the windscreen. Jack is addressing a meeting of concerned locals. Jack glares at Louis as one of the other deputies leads him away.",
    "961": "Now in a black star-sprinkled sky, a sliver of sunlight crests the Earth. Rays of light shoot off the continents, and a golden word orbits into view. Now letters rain down into two boxes, spelling out a logo. Now in a shadowy stone hallway, a lone figure stands under a vaulted ceiling, silhouetted against a wrought iron and plate glass door. In a fine overcoat, he twiddles a wrapped cough drop in his fingers. Now constituents wave signs. Later David greets suburbanites. Now David rides on a Coast Guard boat as it takes a high splash. In the country, David talks with a farmer, then appears with Mayor Bloomberg outside City Hall. In a bar. Now, before a huge crowd, he chats with Madeleine Albright, Wesley Clark and Jesse Jackson. Outside Fordham University's Keating Hall, a young man in the crowd claps, his gaze sternly interested. He wears a newsboy cap, V-neck, and tie. David smiles at his many supporters. Now indoors, an aide runs to David's campaign chairman. Charlie slaps the newspaper shut. Elsewhere, the young and the newsboy cap studies a slim, hardcover book. He folds it shut, and answers his cell phone. He works his lips under his trim dusting of a moustache. Now in a conservative hotel suite, David steps into view, toting a satchel and duffel bag. He later removes a folder from the satchel and flips it open. Later still, its contents lie untouched on a table as David stares out a window at the city. He gloomily peers toward the sitting area, then picks up a TV remote and hits a button. David watches from the couch. Now on a downtown rooftop, four gentlemanly figures cross to the guard rail, each in a fedora, overcoat and necktie. One is the mustached young man. The eldest one speaks. The older member looks briefly at his mustached peer. In the suite, Charlie joins David. Charlie aims the remote at the TV. Charlie tosses a tie at David. He eyes its blue and red stripes. Later, Charlie and David hang their heads. A woman hands off a slip of paper. David strides off. Charlie catches up to him. David leaves the Elegant Function Room. Then a newscast shows on a TV. Now David stands alone in a grand formal hallway. Head bowed, he holds his hands in his pockets. Later he enters a stately Men's Room. He studies note cards. Switching views over time show David at varying spots on the polished marble floor. He washes his hands. David straightens his New York shaped lapel pin. David looks to the row of closed stall doors. One opens. A lovely woman in a silk spaghetti-strap dress with a black lace bodice emerges bashfully.",
    "963": "He holds her for another moment, then pulls away and glances at her. He forces a faint smile, and Elise gives him a tender look. He turns away, and she watches him with concerned eyes. As he trudges out of the emergency room, a discouraged expression crosses her face. Exiting the ER, David walks down a corridor, his pained eyes staring straight ahead. A view from behind shows his lone form filing down the long hospital hallway. Meanwhile, Elise sits alone in the hospital waiting room. She blinks back tears, then shakes her head. Now a friend pushes Elise in a wheelchair, and they head out. Now in a vast hallway lined with marble, Richardson joins Harry at a window overlooking New York City. Harry's gaze stays trained ahead. Harry gives him a skeptical look. Richardson puts on his fedora, gives Harry a pat on the arm, and walks off, leaving the younger officer alone at the window of the mid-century high-rise. 11 months later, now on a sunny farm, David walks a green pasture. Later, in front of a barn and silos, he addresses a crowd. Sitting in a campaign bus, Charlie and an aide watch a news report on the vehicle's TV. Charlie heads outside. As David greets his supporters, the campaign chairman sits on a picnic table and reads a newspaper. He browses a page, folds it up, and frowns thoughtfully to himself. As voters disperse, David joins him. Charlie holds out the newspaper. An arts section feature shows photos of Elise, one dancing, the other with a bow. David stares at the photo, his brow cinched. As he leaves, Charlie gazes after him with pursed lips. Seated outside a waterfront warehouse, he wears a sober frown. Now under a dusky sky, David walks across a deserted shipping dock. He carelessly tracks his feet through a large glassy puddle and stops at the dock's edge, gazing toward the low sun. In her apartment, Elise sits at the foot of her bed, eyeing a document. She sets it aside, then lifts her troubled gaze. Now David approaches the ragged bar. As David disappears inside, Harry emerges from a neighboring door. Inside, David sits forlornly at the bar. The bartender hands him a slip of paper. David stares after her, then reads the note. At dusk, under pouring rain, he holds his jacket over his head as he runs along a dock to a warehouse. In the evening, he leans on the wall, waiting. Harry arrives in a fedora and trench coat, sheltered from the rain by an umbrella. He joins David. Harry lowers his gaze and takes a deep breath. He gives a grave shake of the head, then takes a seat on a stack of shipping pallets.",
    "966": "David halts an oncoming car by holding up a hand and pulls Elise safely across the street. Fording through it, he leads Elise out onto a grassy island. Looking up, she sees the Statue of Liberty towering above. David spots a pair of doors, crosses to them and faces Elise. Elise's eyes pool with tears. She hangs her head and then takes in David's earnest expression. A tear rolls down her cheek. She swallows and nods bravely. Elise goes to him and takes his hand. They face a set of double doors. David takes hold of the right-hand knob. They turn the knobs and the doors open to a long hallway with a polished marble floor. As they enter, the doors shut behind them. On the street, Thompson and his aide gawk. Their plan book shows David and Elise's pathway has united and intermittent red dots flash in a column. At the bureau, Harry reads the same in his plan book. With a grave look, he steps away. David and Elise push open a pair of doors and enter the bureau reading room. David knocks a staffer out of the way. Leaving Elise behind him, he shoves another. They race along a walkway bordering the room. David finds a door and they hurry through. Thompson and his staff enter the reading room. Bureau members stare as they march down the center aisle. Meanwhile, David and Elise hurry up a palatial spiral staircase. In the reading room, Thompson leads his team to the peripheral walkway, then the door. David glances upward. The flights of stairs seem to continue infinitely. Now in a white marble hall, a staffer holds out a large manila envelope. Harry grimly takes it, heads back down the hall and turns out of view. Now a black-garbed intervention team passes through a columned archway. Thompson and his staff jog up the spiraling stairway. At a landing, he slides open a door of bronze bars. Now David and Elise reach a hallway. He takes her hand and they hurry on. David peers over his shoulder. They reach a door, glance about, and go through. In a green-carpeted office, a bookish receptionist looks up. The two intruders run through a series of identical offices. David offers a staffer a cordial wave as he and Elise proceed through the offices. Now the black-clad intervention team marches into a records archive where rows of bookcases shelve white-spine volumes. David and Elise arrive in another identical records room. Reaching the far end, they find two intervention teams approaching. David leads Elise through more of the bafflingly connected records rooms. Finding a dark green door framed in green marble, he desperately yanks it open.",
    "969": "David slams down the receiver, then creeps to the hallway door. The other door opens and helmeted men grab David. As he struggles, they wrestle him to the floor, flip him on his back, and hold him down. The mustached stranger crouches down and presses a cloth to David's face. David's view fades to black. Through groggy eyes, he sees the helmeted men carrying him under a high ceiling with bright lights. Later, he finds himself in a stark warehouse, his wrists bound. The white-haired boss uses a phone, then hangs up. They eye David, who sits in a chair. The white-haired man consults the book, then meets David's gaze and smiles. He steps over. David bolts and frees his wrists. A point of a finger from Richardson telekinetically lifts a floor tile, tripping David. Two men in body suits grab him and drag him back to his chair. The mustached stranger observes. David presses his hands to his face and rocks himself. Richardson aims a scold at his underling. As four men exit an SUV, Richardson sits facing David, whose jaw hangs slack. He shifts his eyes. Richardson stands and a man removes his chair. He stares down at David, who nods. Two men grab David and restrain his arms. Richardson's boyish partner finds the business card in David's wallet. Richardson lights it on fire. Fire consumes the card. The boyish man returns David's wallet. Richardson drops the blazing card and points a finger at David and waits. Two men escort David to a door. Richardson watches as the men lift David off his feet and toss him through, head first. David lands in Charlie's office. As one door closes, Charlie enters from the other. David stares, then opens the other door, but finds only the small conference room. David scrutinizes his friend. Charlie hangs up his phone. With a puzzled look, David steps into the conference room. Charlie fixes a crooked picture on the wall. As David heads out, Charlie gapes at him, then follows. At the foot of some stairs, the receptionist, Susan, smiles. David shoots an uneasy look at her. Later, in the conference room, sitting at the long table, David blinks his bemused eyes. As a handful of colleagues listen to a woman's analysis, Charlie paces thoughtfully. He gives a faint shrug. David's eyes focus on Charlie. He smiles, then shifts his gaze to David, who stares at him with a confused expression. Blinking, David focuses, then shrugs his hands. Now David stares at a secretary on a phone as he and a friend pass her cubicle. Charlie leads him inside. Leaning on his desk, he folds his arms.",
    "971": "Turning the corner, he runs down another street and catches up to Elise as she makes another turn on foot. She stops, grins, squirms, takes a breath, then eyes him. Meanwhile, a man runs down a corridor. It's the boyish officer. He opens a door marked Mr. Richardson and finds the veteran officer at his desk. The messenger shows a map book. He grabs his brown fedora. In the hall, he passes Harry who doffs his hat. The boyish officer, now sporting his own hat, follows Richardson through a door. They arrive in a cafe co-room and spy David and Elise. The boyish officer checks his map book. A host sits them. His book shows pulsing red dots. Outside, David glances aside. At their outdoor table, Elise smiles to herself and peeks at David. The officers share a table. David glances around as a server fills his water glass. Outside, Richardson and his aide follow a walkway to a spot overlooking the outdoor dining area. The aide checks his map book. A red inflection point pulses larger. Charlie arrives. A third officer arrives. Charlie pays the check. Elise grins at David. Richardson and his aide look on. David and Elise go to kiss. Richardson triggers a text to Charlie. His interjection prevents the kiss. David nods amiably, then gives Elise a long kiss on the cheek. A relieved Richardson bows his head. She nods smiling radiantly. Later, by the Brooklyn Bridge, David exits a Town Car and shakes many hands. David takes the podium before a crowd of hundreds. The gathering overlooks the East River. Richardson's aide gets a text. We just moved the rehearsal back to Cedar Lake. David peers across the river to Pier 17. In a quaint eclectic apartment, Elise puts on a hoodie and picks up her cell. A text message reads. Rehearsal back at Cedar Lake, not Pier 17. David's senate race gathering wraps up. David spies Richardson in a window. Both Adjustment officers duck out of sight. David frowns at the Pier 17 structures across the river. Richardson pouts. David stares at the now empty window. Now, a large water taxi crosses the river. David rides aboard it as the skipper pilots it to the pier. David hurries onto the platform and up some stairs. He follows a covered walkway alongside a commercially refurbished warehouse. Finding a studio door chain-locked, he makes a call on his cell. David checks his phone. It reads disconnected, call failed, searching for signal. With a determined gaze, David jogs off the pier. Richardson and his aide observe. The officers follow David in the map book. Now, David rounds a corner, coming face to face with the two officers.",
    "972": "David walks on as they accompany him. He eyes the boyish officer who promptly closes his map book. Under David's unwavering gaze, Richardson frowns a little. David crosses the street to a bistro, while the boyish aide checks his book. The Adjustment officers watch David stride briskly outside. Now, David stands by the curb and hails an approaching cab, but its roof light switches to off duty as it drives by. David tries again, but a mini-van taxi ignores him. He jogs out into the opposite lane, waving high for another cab that passes him up. Richardson and his aide stand casually by as David jogs away. They swap a thoughtful look. In his dress shoes, David sprints after a cab. As the cabbie waves and slows, a sedan crashes into his passenger side. David runs over to the damaged cars and glances at the sedan driver who checks the bloody-faced cabbie. He then checks on the other driver and makes a call. David goes to another cop, but the rebuffed cop looks to Richardson, then walks away. They both look aside but find no one. David strides off, leaving an ambulance and a squad car behind. He checks his watch, takes a few more brisk steps, then breaks into a run. A taxi stops, and as they near a traffic light, it changes from green to red. The surrounding cars stop, and a man and a woman in the crosswalk scurry out of their way. David sees Richardson and his aide emerge from a door as the taxi leaves the Adjustment Bureau servants behind. In a pub, the officers detour through a side door which ports them to a street. The hostess hurries after them but finds only a coat closet. The Bureau officers try a residential door but find Central Park on the other side. They race up the steps of a townhouse. As David's cab cruises through another intersection, the Bureau officers run through an art gallery, bumping a bystander. Heading outside, they see David exit the cab and enter a building. Richardson's hat blows off. As Richardson enters, David opens a door and sees Elise executing a graceful sidestep. Richardson catches his breath and makes eye contact with David. The boyish aide hands him a cellphone. As Richardson walks off, David's gaze returns to Elise. David stares at Elise as she partners with a man who holds her waist in one hand. She balances on one foot, bends over, and briefly flutters her other foot high behind her. As the male dancer dips in a far stepping lunge, Elise rolls fluidly over his back. David enters the studio. Outside, Richardson walks beside a marble facade. He pulls open a brass lobby door and disappears into a midcentury high-rise, its window's number in the hundreds ascending into the sky, story after story after story.",
    "985": "Thomas encounters a maid standing in his way, pushes her aside, and leans into the cot to uncover the infant. Suddenly horrified, he gags. Meanwhile, the priest sprinkles holy water on the dying mother. Thomas snatches the baby from its cot and runs, hurrying downstairs and bounding out of the house while cradling the baby, which is wrapped in a blanket. He tears through the street, stumbling as he pushes past revelers, one of whom swigs from a bottle of booze. Clutching the baby, he stops at the edge of a darkened river. Panting, he turns to see a policeman emerge from a nearby warehouse, holding a lantern. Thomas looks left along the river path, then breaks into a run. The policeman blows his whistle as he gives chase. Thomas runs into the gloom behind the warehouses and comes out in a dimly lit road, weaving between slow-moving traffic and scurrying into the shadows. The policeman glances left and right, then gathers speed, as Thomas darts through a gateway in a concrete wall. Holding the baby close, he secrets himself in the shadows and glances back to see the policeman hurry past. Thomas heaves a sigh of relief and steps forward into a pool of light emanating from a nearby window. Trembling, he turns a corner and approaches the back steps of a clapboard building, stoops down, and puts the baby on the fourth step. He takes money from his jacket and slips it into the baby's blanket. He hides as a young black couple, Tizzy and Queenie, step out onto the back porch. The bespectacled man, Tizzy, watches as Queenie dabs herself with a cloth and stifles a smile. Thomas leaves. Tizzy strikes a pose in his fine suit and bowler hat while the baby lies just feet away on the steps. Queenie opens the blanket to reveal the baby, which has an old and very wrinkled face. She gasps, and Tizzy covers his mouth. Queenie steps closer to inspect it, then carries the baby into the house. Tizzy follows as she heads for her room, which is in the basement. Queenie closes her door on the old lady, who's wearing a pearl necklace, then peels the blanket from over the baby's face. She opens the top drawer of a dresser, places the baby in it, and half-closes the drawer. She opens her room door to Mrs. Hollister. A doctor stands over an aged resident, and two white-haired old women laugh. Queenie quietly approaches Dr. Rose and whispers in his ear. He inspects the baby, then turns to Queenie. They stare down at the naked baby. Queenie carries the baby into the retirement home lounge, adjusts the blanket, and stares down at him.",
    "989": "Benjamin turns the ship's wheel. Mike, gripping a cigar between his teeth, takes the helm and sharply steers the boat left, grinning. Later, Mike and Benjamin stand at the bar in a shady watering hole. Mike sips his liquor, removes his shirt revealing tattoos over his torso, and strikes a boxing pose with tattoos on it. He kisses his tattooed bicep and grins at Benjamin. Meanwhile, a bevy of prostitutes is gathered on the stairs, and a beautiful woman steps forward. They climb the stairs together. The woman emerges wearily from beneath the rapidly moving covers, and Mike leaves. Benjamin trots down the stairs and out through the back door, past two scantily clad hookers. As he disappears into a crowded back alley, his father, Thomas, leaves a hooker outside an adjacent building and spots Benjamin. Thomas's motorcar pulls up beside Benjamin as he strolls down a rain-washed street. Thomas, sporting a neat mustache, opens the door to Benjamin, who climbs in. The car pulls away, and Thomas turns to regard his son, smiling. A waiter addresses Benjamin as Thomas and Benjamin sit down at a table. They order two whiskeys and clink glasses. Thomas smiles wryly as Benjamin sputters on the whiskey. Later, the bar staff are clearing up. Thomas raises his glass, coughs his whiskey and grimaces, while Benjamin slugs his whiskey. Thomas delivers Benjamin to his front gate. Benjamin raises his fedora, teeters towards the front door, and staggers through the darkened hallway, where Queenie stands with her arms folded. He spasms, then vomits. Very early the next morning, Benjamin tiptoes into Daisy's room, who is now about nine years old, and wakes her. She nods and joins Benjamin outside in the early morning light. They arrive at Captain Mike's tugboat, where the tattooed mariner lies in a deep, alcohol-induced slumber. Mike comes round and Benjamin shakes his head. Mike eyes Daisy, rubs his bare, tattooed chest, then sits up and shoves a cigar in his mouth. The tug makes its way along the river through a thick fog with Benjamin and Daisy standing at the prow, looking out. Benjamin, who wears a woolen hat, glances back at Daisy. In the wheelhouse, Mike sips coffee from an enamel and peers through the window, seeing an ocean liner passing the other way. Daisy and Benjamin climb the steps up to the wheelhouse. Daisy waves to the larger vessel and she and Benjamin share a smile. In the hospital, Caroline turns to Daisy, who stares towards the window as lightning flashes outside. Caroline sits down with the diary and reads. Benjamin stares at himself in the mirror and then at Mrs. Maple, who sits motionless in a chair, her head resting against the seat back, her eyes dull, her mouth slightly open.",
    "996": "Myrtle lands dead in the road with a gash in her chest. Daisy and Gatsby drive on. The other driver gets out and stares at the scene. The eyes on the ragged billboard for the oculist, a Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, stare blankly in the darkness. Tom drives up with Nick and Jordan. Later, police have arrived. They get out and walk towards Wilson's garage, where a crowd has gathered. Tom sees a bereft Wilson and frowns with concern. Policemen hold the crowd back. One of them lays a sheet over Myrtle's body, which lies on a table. Tom steps closer. Tom reaches out and pulls the sheet back, revealing Myrtle's blood-spattered corpse. He gasps and Nick removes his cap. Tom just stares. Tom holds his hand up to the cop. Tearful, Tom shakes his head and looks at Nick. Tom stands, his head bowed. Tom restrains Wilson. The old cop frowns dubiously. The cop walks away. Wilson sits looking dazed. Tom sits facing him and hands him a drink. Tom stares at him. With tears rolling down his face, Wilson drinks and absently presses the glass against his face. Tom touches Wilson's face. Tom lets Wilson rest his head against his shoulder. Looking a little awkward, Tom rubs Wilson's back, comforting him. Nick covers Myrtie's body with the sheet. Tom drives away with Jordan. They stare ahead. The shiny blue coupe heads on down the dark road. They arrive at the Buchanan mansion. Servants come out. Tom walks up and opens the front door. Nick and Jordan stand on the porch. Tom studies Nick. Nick stares back, frowning. With a dismissive glance, Tom goes inside. Nick glares at Jordan. Shocked, she marches into the house. Looking deeply troubled, his brow pinched, Nick turns and walks off. Nick looks around incredulously and walks over to Gatsby, who's hiding behind a bush. Gatsby's face is suddenly bathed in light. Lights come on in the house and the butler, Henri, comes out onto the porch. He looks around but doesn't see anyone, so goes back inside. Nick stares at Gatsby gravely. Gatsby glances up at the lights in the upstairs windows, then back at Nick. A flashback of Gatsby grabbing the wheel. Gatsby and Daisy watch in horror as Myrtle slams against the windscreen and hurtles through the air. Daisy is in the driving seat. Recounting events, Gatsby looks distraught. Nick stares at him, wide-eyed. Gatsby turns away and sits. Gatsby rests his face against his hand. Nick nods sharply and attempts a smile. Nick surreptitiously walks around to the terrace. He sees Tom and Daisy sitting at the dining table, talking. Daisy sits looking dazed. Tom moves closer and puts his arm around Daisy, who looks lost.",
    "998": "The doctor walks over to Nick, who lays down an open book and stares at a silver pencil resting on the blank page. Nick starts to write in his room. Meanwhile, men stand on hills of coal waste, hacking away with pickaxes in a filthy industrial area. Nick is on a packed train with Tom. The train stops and they jump off, running to a garage where Tom slips some money to a woman after pointing at Nick. She eyes both men and smiles at Tom. Myrtle eyes Nick, making him look nervous. Nick sits in Myrtle's gaudy apartment, watching her little dog eat leftovers. He glances at the ceiling, frowning at the sound of Tom and Myrtle upstairs. Nick tentatively walks to the door, putting on his straw boater and opening it to find a sexy, young woman in a green dress leaning on the door frame. Myrtle appears and Nick smiles weakly. Tom picks Nick up, and Catherine drapes herself around him, popping a pill in her mouth and transferring it to Nick's mouth via a kiss. Tom, in a clinch with Myrtle, watches this. Catherine guides Nick's glass to his lips and cocks an eyebrow at him. Tom dances with Myrtle, while Nick dances with Catherine and Chester takes pictures. Tom opens champagne and whacks Nick with a pillow, sending feathers everywhere. A guy plays trumpet on a fire escape as Tom twirls Nick around and Catherine kisses Nick, pulling his shirt off. The girls strip down to their underwear and everyone dances. Nick sits watching woozily with Catherine slumped against him. Myrtle wiggles her hips, pulls her red dress off her shoulder and holds her arms in the air. Nick sits, drugged, as another version of himself pops a champagne cork, shakes the bottle, and pours champagne into his mouth. Tom pours champagne into the seated Nick's mouth from a ceramic goblet. Nick sways on the spot with glazed, drunken eyes. His exuberant self rolls about on a bed with Catherine. The woozy Nick goes to a window and looks across at other apartments, seeing a young black woman looking out and a version of himself standing in the street, looking up. His street self walks off as scenes play out in windows. Nick finds Chester sleeping and wipes cream off his face. Myrtle marches in, followed by Tom, who gives Myrtle a vicious backhander across the face. Nick retreats onto the fire escape as the city recedes."
