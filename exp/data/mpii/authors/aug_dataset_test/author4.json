    "117": "**Movie Description:**\n\nThe film begins with **Walter Neff**, briefcase in hand, exiting a room amidst a crowd. **Lola**, spotting him, rises and intercepts him as he's about to pass her by in the anteroom. Neff, slightly startled, holds the swing door open for her, his eyes narrowing in unsettled speculation as she passes. He accompanies her to his office, where **Lou Schwartz**, a fellow salesman, is busy at his desk. Upon their entry, Schwartz promptly leaves, allowing Neff and Lola privacy. Neff, visibly tense, watches as Lola turns towards the window to hide her tears. Moved, he joins her, attempting to offer comfort.\n\nLater, Neff and Lola share dinner at a bustling **Olvera Street**, filled with sidewalk vendors and guitar players. Following their meal, they take a drive along **Santa Monica** beach, Lola's laughter punctuating her story despite her mourning attire, contrasting Neff's light summer suit. Though she laughs, Neff seems preoccupied, only half-listening to her tale.\n\nIn the following scene, Neff, sans briefcase and donning a hat, approaches **Keyes' office**. He pauses, startled, as he spots **Jackson**\u2014the man from the train's observation platform\u2014waiting outside, engrossed in a file folder. Recognizing him, Neff masks his surprise and enters the office, where **Keyes** lounges on his couch, cigar in mouth.\n\nUpon Neff's entrance, Keyes bolts upright, levels a finger at him, and invites Jackson in. Jackson, cigar in hand, gestures to his file folder, prompting Keyes to make introductions before excusing himself for a phone call. After the call, Keyes rejoins the pair, eventually showing Jackson out. Left alone, Neff watches as Keyes, struck by a thought, begins to pat his pockets, feeling for a match to light his cigar.",
    "1263": "In the dimly lit chamber, Voldemort casts a glance at his serpent, Nagini, before the two vanish abruptly. Meanwhile, Harry, unable to stop shivering, is approached by a disheveled and dirty Hermione and Ron. Hermione, anxious, turns to Ron, who crouches beside Harry. The boy's worry is evident as Hermione also squats down beside him. Harry, trying to compose himself, closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, his jaw tense.\n\nThe scene shifts to a tranquil boathouse where a small boat is docked. Inside, Nagini is coiled up, and Lucius Malfoy stands with Voldemort, who examines his own forearm intently. Back with Harry, he opens his eyes to find his friends staring at him anxiously.\n\nThe once peaceful Hogwarts is now under siege. Death Eaters swoop over the school grounds, as a lone student flies in on a broomstick. A colossal giant wields a scythe, while fierce battles erupt on the staircases. Hermione dashes out through a door, narrowly avoiding a deadly bolt. Harry, fighting back, beats on a door and shoots a Death Eater. A giant armed with a double-headed weapon spots the trio and gives chase, forcing them to hide inside an enormous bell lying on its side. The giant's weapon clangs against the bell, but the creature retreats as massive spiders emerge from the rubble.\n\nHermione darts between the giants' legs, and the trio fends off attacks with their wands, reaching a quieter area. They halt upon seeing a Death Eater leaning over a girl's body. The werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, looks up, but Hermione swiftly casts a spell, sending him crashing through a window. The trio races through a closed-end walkway, pursued by the relentless giants smashing the walls. Reaching the front of the school, they see Dementors flying towards them, but a shimmering barrier is swiftly conjured by Aberforth Dumbledore, who turns back to continue the fight.\n\nThe trio sprints away, descending steps towards the boathouse lights. Inside, Voldemort circles Snape, who maintains steady eye contact. With a swift slicing move of the Elder Wand, Voldemort sends Snape crashing against a glass-paneled wall. Harry, on the other side, watches helplessly as Nagini lunges repeatedly at Snape, who slides down the window, leaving a bloody streak.\n\nEntering the boathouse, Harry approaches the severely injured Snape. Kneeling, Harry attempts to staunch a wound on Snape's neck. The dying man turns his head to look at Harry, a tear rolling down his cheek. Hermione, rummaging through her bag, pulls out a small phial as Harry gazes deeply into Snape's eyes, the weight of the moment hanging heavy in the air.",
    "10": "In the opening scene, Brad is poised to escort Lester out, but Lester gazes at him, helpless. Meanwhile, a moving van is stationed in front of the colonial house next to the Burnhams', and a Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway, driven by Carolyn with Lester in the passenger seat. As they exit the car, Carolyn's attention is drawn to the movers next door carrying furniture into the house. She then leads the way inside, with Lester trailing behind.\n\nLater, Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are seated around a candlelit dinner table adorned with a vase of red roses. Suddenly, Lester turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind, all while Carolyn watches intently. She eventually leaves the table and heads to the kitchen, with Lester noticing her critical gaze before she goes. Lester sits quietly, staring at his plate, before finally getting up and following Jane, taking his plate with him.\n\nJane is at the sink, rinsing her plate, when Lester enters. She turns to stare at him, waiting, but offers no help as he struggles with an awkward attempt at intimacy. Through the greenhouse windows, Lester and Jane are visible in the kitchen, their tense exchange apparent despite the inaudible conversation. Jane places her plate in the dishwasher and exits, with the camera following her out before jerking back to Lester calling after her.\n\nFrom Lester's point of view, captured on video, he is seen at the sink, rinsing his plate and muttering to himself. The camera then reveals Ricky Fitts, an eighteen-year-old with eyes that hold a wisdom beyond his years and a hint of something wounded beneath his Zen-like calm. Lester turns off the faucet and dries his hands, tossing the towel onto the counter near a framed photograph of a younger, happier Burnham family at an amusement park. He pauses, looking out the window where Ricky had been standing, sensing that he is being watched.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn is deep in concentration, cleaning with a relentless determination that has her scrubbing countertops, dusting a cheap ceiling fan, and vacuuming a hopelessly dirty carpet. All the while, she repeatedly mutters to herself, pausing only to neatly arrange her sales materials on a desk before stripping down to her undergarments. Finally, she stands before the mirror, once again dressed in her suit, meticulously applying lipstick."
