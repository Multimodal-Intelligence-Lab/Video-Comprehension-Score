    "117": "Neff emerges from a building, briefcase in hand, alongside several others. As he strides through the anteroom, Lola, who has risen upon spotting him, intercepts him before he can pass her by unnoticed. Startled, Neff gazes at her briefly. He then courteously opens a swing door and gestures for her to proceed ahead of him. As Lola walks past, Neff's eyes narrow, his mind clouded with uneasy thoughts. He guides her towards his office, maintaining a steady pace beside her as the camera follows. At the entrance to his office, Neff again opens the door, allowing Lola to step inside first. Inside, Lou Schwartz, another salesman, is busy at his desk. After Neff and Lola enter, Neff momentarily leaves the room. Upon his return, he fixes a tense stare on Lola. She turns away, facing the window to hide her tears from him. Moved, Neff approaches her.\n\nLater, Neff and Lola are seen dining at a table on Olvera Street, surrounded by the usual bustle of street peddlers and musicians. The scene shifts to them driving along the beach near Santa Monica. Neff sports a light summer suit, starkly contrasting with Lola's somber attire. She shares a story with him, occasionally laughing, though their conversation is silent to the audience. A close shot reveals Neff at the wheel, only half-attentive to Lola's words.\n\nNeff, now without his briefcase but wearing his hat, approaches Keyes' office. His pace slows as he nears the door, a look of surprise crossing his face upon seeing a familiar figure seated nearby. It's Jackson, the man from the train's observation platform, identifiable by his Stetson hat and cigar. Engrossed in a file folder, Jackson does not notice Neff, who quickly composes himself and proceeds to enter Keyes' office. Inside, Neff closes the door behind him. Keyes, sans coat and chewing a cigar as per his habit, springs up from the couch with agility. He points a finger at Neff and then strides over to open the door, allowing Jackson to enter with the file folder. Jackson gestures towards his cigar and then the folder he's carrying. Keyes, realizing his oversight, introduces Jackson to Neff. He then picks up his desk phone and speaks into it, his voice a low murmur in the background as Jackson moves to confront Neff. Keyes eventually joins them. After their discussion, Keyes opens the door for Jackson, who exits while searching his pockets for matches to light his cigar.",
    "1263": "In the midst of a chilling scene, Voldemort's eyes briefly meet those of his serpent, Nagini, before they both vanish abruptly through apparition. Left shivering, Harry continues to tremble uncontrollably. Hermione and Ron, appearing disheveled and coated in grime, approach Harry. Anxious, Hermione turns to Ron as he crouches beside their friend. Harry, looking increasingly worried, receives the comfort of Hermione, who squats down next to him. Seeking solace, Harry closes his eyes and inhales deeply.\n\nNearby, a quaint boathouse stands, a small boat moored alongside it. Inside, Voldemort, alongside Lucius Malfoy, scrutinizes the skin on his forearm, his jaw clenched in tense deliberation. Harry, now breathing through his mouth, reopens his eyes to find his companions staring at him with anxious anticipation.\n\nAs chaos erupts, Death Eaters swarm over the school. A student zooms in on a broomstick amidst the pandemonium, while a giant brandishes a scythe. Battle ensues on the stairs as others fight fiercely. Hermione dashes out through a doorway, narrowly escaping a bolt aimed at her. Harry, pounding on a door, takes down a Death Eater with a swift shot. A giant wielding a two-pronged weapon spots the trio and pursues them relentlessly. Seeking refuge, they squeeze inside a massive bell lying on its side. The giant's weapon strikes the bell forcefully, but the trio's respite is short-lived as colossal spiders emerge, crawling over the rubble. Hermione skillfully navigates between the giants as they fend off attacks with their wands, eventually reaching a quieter section of the battlefield. They halt upon discovering a Death Eater hunched over a girl's body, and the werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, glances up knowingly. Hermione swiftly casts a spell that sends Greyback crashing through a window. The trio continues their desperate run along a closed-end walkway, with the giants smashing through walls in hot pursuit.\n\nTheir flight brings them to the front of the school, where they witness Dementors approaching. Suddenly, a shimmering barrier materializes before them, cast by Aberforth Dumbledore, who stands with his wand outstretched. As Aberforth and his allies turn to re-engage in the battle, the trio sprints away. They race out onto a raised walkway, descending steps towards the lights emanating from the boathouse.\n\nInside the boathouse, Snape stands with Voldemort, who fixes him with an intense stare. Snape manages a perfect smile despite the tension. Voldemort circles him, Snape's eyes never leaving his adversary. With a swift slicing motion using the Elder Wand, Voldemort strikes, sending Snape crashing against a glass-paneled wall. Harry, positioned on the other side, watches helplessly as Nagini lunges repeatedly at Snape, slamming him against the lead-paned glass which trembles but holds firm. Harry and his friends, unable to intervene, are left standing outside, witnessing Snape's bloody hand slide down a window before falling limply to the floor.\n\nEntering the boathouse, they find Snape still alive, his lower jaw trembling. Harry moves toward him, kneeling down beside him to staunch a wound on his neck. As Snape turns his head to look at Harry, their eyes lock in a deep gaze. A tear trickles down Snape's cheek. In a rush, Hermione searches her bag, pulling out a small phial, ready to assist.",
    "10": "Brad, poised to escort Lester out, stands firmly as Lester, feeling helpless, stares back at him. Next to the Burnhams' residence, a moving van is parked in front of a colonial house. Carolyn drives the Mercedes-Benz into the Burnham driveway, with Lester seated beside her. As they exit the vehicle, Carolyn surveys the movers next door who are busy carrying furniture into the house. Carolyn then proceeds indoors, followed by Lester.\n\nThe Burnham family\u2014Lester, Carolyn, and their daughter Jane\u2014gather for dinner illuminated by candlelight, with a vase of red roses adorning the center of the table. During the meal, Lester abruptly turns to Jane, prompting her to look at him as though he's lost his mind. Carolyn observes this interaction intently before rising and heading to the kitchen, leaving them behind. Lester becomes aware of Carolyn's critical gaze upon him and remains silent, his focus fixed on his plate. He then rises, taking his plate with him, and follows Jane to the sink where she is rinsing off her dish. Upon Lester's entrance, Jane turns to face him, awaiting his next move. Lester seeks some form of connection, but Jane, unsettled by this sudden intimacy, is unable to respond. Viewed through greenhouse windows, their conversation appears strained.\n\nJane places her dish in the dishwasher and exits the kitchen. The camera follows her departure and then quickly returns to Lester who calls out to her from inside. Through the kitchen window, a video captures Lester at the sink, muttering to himself as he rinses his plate. The camera focuses on Ricky Fitts, an eighteen-year-old with eyes that betray a maturity beyond his years and a hidden wound beneath his serene facade. As he records with his Digicam, Lester turns off the faucet and looks out the window, noticing that Ricky, who had been standing there moments before, has vanished. Ricky's head suddenly jerks up, his gaze meeting the camera as if he's aware he's being watched. Lester dries his hands, tosses the towel onto the counter where it lands beside a framed photograph of a younger Lester, Carolyn, and Jane at an amusement park, and exits the room.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn, with intense focus, engages in household chores: cleaning the glass doors that overlook the patio and pool, scrubbing countertops, dusting a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom from atop a stepladder, and vacuuming a carpet that seems perpetually dirty. After her cleaning marathon, Carolyn stands in front of a mirror, now wearing her suit again, meticulously applying lipstick. Throughout her tasks, she silently repeats a mantra to herself. She also takes time to neatly arrange her sales materials on a desk before stripping down to her undergarments, revealing her meticulous nature in both her professional and personal spaces."
