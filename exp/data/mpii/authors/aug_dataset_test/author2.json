    "117": "As several people exit the building, Neff emerges carrying his briefcase. Lola spots him and rises from her seat, stopping him as he attempts to pass through the anteroom without noticing her. Startled by the encounter, Neff holds the swing door open for her. As she walks past, his eyes narrow with subtle unease. They proceed together toward his office, where he again demonstrates courtesy by holding the door.\n\nInside, Lou Schwartz, another salesman, is working at his desk but exits as Lola and Neff enter. The tension is palpable as Neff stares at her intently. Overcome with emotion, Lola turns to face the window, hiding her tears. Neff rises and approaches her.\n\nLater, they share dinner on Olvera Street, surrounded by the vibrant atmosphere of street vendors and musicians. Their relationship evolves as they drive along the Santa Monica beach, Neff in light summer attire contrasting sharply with Lola's mourning clothes. She occasionally laughs while telling stories, though Neff seems only half-engaged, lost in his own thoughts.\n\nThe scene shifts as Neff, wearing his hat but without his usual briefcase, approaches Keyes' office. He stops abruptly, surprised to see Jackson - the man from the train's observation platform - sitting beside the door. Jackson, wearing a Stetson and smoking a cigar, remains focused on his file folder, not acknowledging Neff's presence. Maintaining his composure, Neff enters Keyes' office.\n\nInside, he finds Keyes lounging on his office couch, characteristically chewing a cigar. Keyes suddenly springs up with energy, pointing at Neff before opening the door to admit Jackson. During their interaction, Jackson gestures to both his cigar and the file folder he carries. After Keyes belatedly introduces Jackson and makes a phone call, Jackson and Neff engage in conversation while Keyes' voice murmurs in the background. Once Jackson departs, Keyes fumbles through his pockets searching for matches to light the cigar he's placed in his mouth.",
    "1263": "In a tense moment, Voldemort exchanges a glance with his snake before disapparating. A shivering Harry is approached by his disheveled friends, Ron and Hermione, who crouch beside him with visible concern. As Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath through his mouth, his jaw tense with worry, the scene shifts to a boat house where Nagini lies curled up. There, Lucius Malfoy stands with Voldemort, who examines his forearm while Harry opens his eyes to his friends' anxious stares.\n\nChaos erupts as Death Eaters sweep over the school. A student flies by on a broomstick while a giant wielding a scythe joins the battle raging on the stairs. Hermione barely escapes through a door as a bolt whizzes past her. Harry engages and shoots down a Death Eater, but the trio soon finds themselves pursued by a giant carrying two-pronged weapons. They take shelter inside a massive fallen bell, which the giant strikes before retreating as enormous spiders crawl over the debris.\n\nHermione darts between giants as they all defend themselves with their wands, reaching a quieter area where they encounter a Death Eater hovering over a girl's body. The werewolf Fenrir Greyback looks up, only to be blasted through a window by Hermione's spell. Their escape through a closed-end walkway is threatened by the persistent giant who demolishes walls in pursuit. As they reach the front of the school, Dementors approach, but Aberforth Dumbledore appears, creating a shimmering barrier with his outstretched wand.\n\nThe trio races toward the boat house's lights via a raised walkway, where they find Snape confronting Voldemort. As Snape maintains a practiced smile, Voldemort circles him menacingly before making a sudden slicing motion with the Elder Wand. Snape crashes against a glass wall, and Nagini violently attacks him, repeatedly slamming him against the glass while Harry and his friends watch helplessly from outside. Snape's bloody hand slides down the window before falling limply.\n\nWhen they finally enter the boat house, they find Snape clinging to life, his jaw trembling. Harry kneels beside him, attempting to stop the bleeding from his neck wound. In their final moment together, they share a profound gaze as a tear rolls down Snape's cheek, prompting Hermione to quickly retrieve a small phial from her bag.",
    "10": "A Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway with Carolyn at the wheel and Lester in the passenger seat. Next door, a moving van is parked in front of a colonial house, where movers are busy carrying furniture inside. As the Burnhams exit their car, Carolyn's attention is drawn to the activity next door before she and Lester head inside.\n\nLater, the family sits down to dinner by candlelight, with red roses arranged in a vase as the centerpiece. The meal takes an awkward turn when Lester suddenly addresses Jane, causing her to look at him as though he's gone crazy. Carolyn observes the interaction intently before excusing herself to the kitchen. In her absence, Lester becomes aware of Carolyn's critical gaze, and he sits quietly, staring down at his plate before following Jane with his own dishes.\n\nIn the kitchen, Jane rinses her plate at the sink as Lester enters, attempting to establish a connection. She meets his gaze but remains uncomfortable with this unexpected attempt at closeness, offering no assistance in the conversation. Through the greenhouse windows, their failed interaction plays out silently before Jane loads her plate in the dishwasher and exits.\n\nAs Lester calls after his daughter and begins washing his own plate, he's unknowingly being observed. Through a digital camera's viewfinder, eighteen-year-old Ricky Fitts watches the scene unfold. Despite his young age, Ricky's eyes reflect an old soul, and beneath his calm exterior lies hidden pain. When Lester suddenly looks up, sensing he's being watched, Ricky has already vanished from his observation point.\n\nLester finishes at the sink, dries his hands, and carelessly tosses the towel on the counter next to a framed photograph. The picture captures a happier time: Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane at an amusement park, taken years before.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn engages in an obsessive cleaning routine. She methodically arranges her sales materials on a desk before removing her clothes down to her underwear. With intense focus, she tackles various household tasks: cleaning the glass patio doors, scrubbing kitchen countertops, dusting a modest ceiling fan while perched on a stepladder, and determinedly vacuuming a hopelessly stained carpet. Finally, she dons her suit again and applies lipstick in front of the mirror, completing her ritual."
