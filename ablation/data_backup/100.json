Meanwhile, an anchorman stands in front of the White House, delivering a report with a serious expression. Forrest, sitting on a bus bench, turns his attention to a fat man seated nearby, observing him with curiosity. In another scene, President Nixon holds a plaque with a sense of pride, while Forrest, in a different location, picks up a phone, speaks into it briefly, and then gently places the receiver back down, ending the call.

An officer approaches Forrest, handing him an envelope with a formal demeanor, and then turns to walk away, leaving Forrest to contemplate the contents. Forrest, filled with determination, grabs his paddle and swiftly exits the gymnasium, his footsteps echoing in the empty space.

At the pier, Forrest hands an old black shrimper a large wad of cash, a gesture of gratitude and respect, before standing solemnly at the grave. He then takes control of his shrimping boat, an old and rusty vessel, and releases the nets into the water. As the nets are pulled back up, the catch of the day spills onto the deck, revealing a disappointing haul of garbage and shells. Undeterred, Forrest picks up one shrimp, examining it closely, and then pulls a couple more shrimp out of a bucket, assessing his modest success. The old shrimper begins to walk away, but pauses, turning back to watch Forrest as he carefully paints a name on the side of his boat, marking it with a sense of ownership and hope. In a different scene, disco lights flash energetically, casting colorful patterns across the room as people dance with abandon. A guy, caught up in the moment, asks a girl to dance, his voice barely audible over the music. Meanwhile, Forrest stands confidently at the helm of his boat, guiding it smoothly across the water. In a stark contrast, a table is cluttered with drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash, a man carelessly dropping a syringe onto the table before reaching over to touch Jenny, who appears pale and weary, dark lines etched under her eyes. Jenny, in a moment of desperation, smears lines of cocaine on a mirror, her reflection staring back at her, before she steps out onto the high-rise balcony. She climbs onto a table, standing precariously on the edge of the balcony, her eyes drawn to the busy street many stories below. As she looks down at the intersection, a moment of fear grips her, causing her to slip slightly over the edge. Regaining her balance, she turns away from the dizzying height, her gaze lingering on the intersection below, before she carefully begins to climb down from the edge. With a firm grip on the ledge, she lowers herself safely, then collapses into a chair, her body rocking back and forth as she cries, overwhelmed by the emotions of the moment."

Dan flips back over, then pulls himself back up onto his wheelchair, breathing heavily as he copes with the physical strain. An anchorman reports in front of the White House, a historic building and the residence of the U.S. President. Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench, a scene reminiscent of his many encounters with strangers while waiting for the bus. President Nixon, who was embroiled in the Watergate scandal leading to his resignation, holds the plaque, and Forrest speaks on the phone, then hangs up. President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV, and the television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing outside Air Force One, the official aircraft of the President, with his hands in the peace sign, a gesture he often used. An officer hands Forrest an envelope, a common military communication method, and then walks away. Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium, reminiscent of his time as a ping-pong champion, a sport he mastered which gained him international attention. Mrs. Gump, Forrest's devoted mother who always supported him, walks out of the house and smiles as Forrest walks up to the house, wearing his military uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house, where there are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong, evidence of his fame from winning championships. Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou, an area in Louisiana known for its unique ecosystem, as a group of black kids play in the front yard. Bubba's mother, Mrs. Blue, part of a community dependent on shrimping, and her other children look at Forrest as he steps over to Bubba's tombstone, remembering his late friend, and pulls out notes from his pocket, then walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black shrimper a large wad of cash, likely to buy a shrimping boat, and stands at the grave before steering his shrimping boat, named after his friend. The boat is old and rusty, a reflection of Forrest's modest beginnings in the shrimping business, as Forrest unleashes his nets, and his catch of the day drops to the deck, which consists of a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks up one shrimp and pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket, hopeful for a successful catch. The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks at Forrest as he paints a name on the side of his boat, paying tribute to his friend by naming it Jenny after the woman he loves. Disco lights flash, and people dance at a nightclub, a popular scene during the 1970s, while a guy asks a girl to dance. Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the water, reflecting his newfound skill as a captain. Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on a table, indicating a scene of illegal activity, as a man drops a syringe on the table and reaches over to touch Jenny, who is pale with dark lines under her eyes, showing the toll of her lifestyle choices. Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror, a habit she's fallen into, and looks at herself in the mirror, then steps out onto the high-rise balcony of her apartment, a place of solitude in her chaotic life, and steps up on a table to stand on the edge of the balcony. A busy street lies many stories below as Jenny looks down to the intersection, a moment of contemplation amidst her turmoil, then slips over the edge. She regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge, an act of self-preservation. Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down, then sits down on a chair and rocks back and forth as she cries, overwhelmed by her situation."

On the way, he passes a neighbor who greets him briefly. At the bus stop, he notices a group of students talking about an upcoming test. He boards the bus and sits near the back, watching the city pass by outside the window. After a few stops, he gets off near a large office building. He enters the lobby and goes through security. He rides an elevator to the tenth floor, where he works as an assistant. His manager asks him to prepare some documents for a meeting later in the day. He collects files from different departments and organizes them in a conference room. Another employee asks him for help with a software issue, so he takes a few minutes to fix it. Then he returns to the conference room to double-check everything before the meeting begins. The meeting starts at noon. Several people join via video call, and others sit around the table. The manager outlines the project goals, and each team member shares updates on their tasks. There are questions about deadlines and budgets, but no big surprises. After an hour, they end the call. The manager thanks everyone and leaves. The assistant cleans up the room, collects leftover notes, and heads back to his desk. During lunch, he walks to a nearby café, where he orders a simple meal. He eats alone and checks social media on his phone. After lunch, he returns to the office and finishes smaller tasks, such as sending emails and filing paperwork. He also helps a coworker carry boxes of supplies to another floor. Later in the afternoon, the manager calls him in to discuss next week's schedule. They go over a few changes, and the assistant updates the calendar. When the workday ends, he logs off his computer and leaves the building. Outside, he walks a few blocks to meet a friend. They chat about weekend plans and decide to see a film on Saturday. The assistant then heads home on a crowded bus. At his apartment, he sorts his mail, feeds a pet cat, and warms up leftovers for dinner. He watches a short news segment on TV, then checks his phone again. A message from his friend confirms their plan for the weekend. He feels relieved to have something to look forward to. The film ends with him preparing for bed, setting an alarm, and turning off the lights. He reflects briefly on the day, thinking about his tasks, his quiet home, and the plans ahead."
